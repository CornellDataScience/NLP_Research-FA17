       "['Very chic. Although, the menu items doesnt SCREAM French cuisine. Most foods looks like you can get at any American place.\\n\\nThe food is awesome though. One of the few places I actually come out satisfied. I ordered the Smoked salmon platter. I enjoyed it. I enjoy simple foods. My plate had shreds of salmon, a pile of capers (I LOVE CAPERS) and a gallop of cream cheese. You also had a choice of an everything or plain bagel. I put everything together and it was simply delish.\\n\\nService is super proper, like they were brainwashed. Not at all casual. Not that it hurts the business but it looks like they need to relax. \\n\\nPricing is alright. My uncle and I sat outside during high noon and the sun was just right on top of us. I didnt mind, I had sunglasses but I DO absolutely love the view of the Bellagio and caught one of their water fountain shows.',\n",
       " \"Cute french bistro with great service. I came on a Sunday morning without reservations. I appreciate how they have separate lines for indoor/outdoor dining options. Obviously, on a nice day, the outdoor dining line is longer. We were pretty much seated right away with the indoor line and ended up sitting near a door, which was cool so we got the best of both worlds.\\n\\nBreakfast/brunch has lots of options. I ordered a ham and cheese crepe which really hit the spot. Everything about it was tasty: savory ham, melted cheese that wasn't too runny. I also added an egg to it so it was over easy that the yolk ran over the crepe like a sauce. Delicious and filling. \\n\\nOn a side note, there's a self-serve bloody mary bar with lots of options. I think this was the first time I saw a pepperoni stick or jerky thing that you could add. I didn't have any, but it sounded like my friends were happy with their bloody marys. \\n\\nI would definitely come back if in the area and looking for a good place to eat.\",\n",
       " \"The food is very good, the prices fair and the atmosphere can't be beat!  The staff is friendly and efficient.  My personal fave is the Florentine Benedict.  This is a go to spot for us every time we are in Vegas!\\nTip: Use Open Table to reserve your table before walking over!\",\n",
       " \"One of my favorite go-to brunch spots on the Las Vegas Strip. Plenty of scenic views from right out front of the Paris LV Hotel. \\n\\nA very deep, diverse, and enjoyable menu for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner. \\n\\nWe always have great service here, and on this occasion Derrick did not disappoint. The line can get SUPER LONG, and especially on weekends and holidays. We made a reservation via phone while we were walking towards the Paris, and the hostess was super nice, we went right up to the check in stand, and were seated in less than 3 minutes while a line of 200 people waited. Sweet!\\n\\nHad a nice table, a great server who despite it being almost 11am allowed us to order off the full breakfast menu.\\n\\nI had a personal favorite, the Smoked Salmon Benedict. I also added a side of brioche toast and it is sinfully sweet bread with the best sweet butter and jam. If you're gonna sin in Vegas...eat this!!\\n\\nMy gf got a ham and cheese crepe with fired potatoes and fruit. \\n\\nAll requests were honored by our server and handled with ease. The food came out super fast, and it was TOP NOTCH.\\n\\nA tasty, delightful breakfast, without waiting for under $50 in Vegas!!!! YES!!!!\\n\\nParis is well situated center-strip so when you're done fueling up, the sky is truly the limit...quick walks to whatever you want to do, see, and buy!! I love Mon Ami...usually breakfast there at least once every trip to Vegas (which is usually 4x a year or more), and I cannot rave enough about the service and convenience. \\n\\nMAKE A RESERVATION...!!\\n\\nENJOY!\",\n",
       " 'Simply amazing steak and frites. Got the blue cheese butter. All I can say is wow. Staff was very attentive and friendly. Also tried the Mac and cheese which was great. Guy next to me had the French onion soup and it was huge. The table bread was great and plenty of it.',\n",
       " \"I always walk by here and eating on the outside patio seemed so perfect.  The weather was perfect and sunny.  Anyway, the wait was a bit long and we decided to sit inside.  \\n\\nI was expecting good food, like really good food and probably small portions.  Anyway we ordered the French onion soup and the beef hash with poached eggs.\\n\\nThe soup was too salty, we received 2 pieces of potatoes with the eggs, and the eggs were a little overcooked.  The hash was decent.  \\n\\nHonestly, the bread they gave us to go with the meal was the best-nutty soft with butter and fresh jam.\\n\\nI don't' really see what the hype was, but I still enjoyed my time here.\",\n",
       " 'The scallops were amazing. So was the filet mignon. Best place on the strip for a reasonable rate. p.s. The wait staff is amazing and very knowledgeable! A must in Las Vegas!',\n",
       " \"Oui oui, I am a fan. Lunch reservations at Mon Ami Gabi with an excellent seating area, we were in between the outdoor and indoor area (near the bar) with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio Water show. Quite hungover and sleepy, I was still able to enjoy the lunch. Started with fresh warm baguette and butter. I chose the warm chicken and brie sandwich. It was amazing, the apple slices add a fresh crunch and sweetness to the sandwich. I sampled one of my friend's onion soup which was AMAZING! \\n\\nIf ever I am back in Vegas, I'd love to come and try this restaurant again.\",\n",
       " \"I came here for a super late lunch and wasn't that impressed. I was there during Thanksgiving Day and it was packed. Luckily we made reservations so we had no issues with getting a table. \\n\\nOrdered: Chicken & Mushroom Crepe ($14.95), Classic Quiche Lorraine ($14.95), and the Onion Soup Au Gratin ($10.95). \\n\\nNote in my point of view, that all three choices are enough to share with another person. My favorite out of all the three was the Chicken & Mushroom Crepe. The Classic Quiche Lorraine wasn't that great (I've had better & overpriced). The Onion Soup Au Gratin was definitely overpriced for the overall taste. \\n\\nAll in all, it wasn't as impressive as it was all hyped up to be -_-... oh, and the French Baguette they give, meh. You can go to a grocery store and get better :D\",\n",
       " \"This had to be one of the highlights of our trip. We decided to spend our first morning in Vegas enjoying an amazing breakfast, and we found it. \\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered 3 sunnyside eggs and bacon and a fruit salad, I ordered the Eggs Benedict special. It was so good it was actually ridiculous. They had it for us in just minutes and only $10 a plate! \\n\\nThe best part was sitting out on the patio infront of the Eiffel tower on a nice sunny morning. \\n\\nIf you're going to Vegas, come here for breakfast! Just do it!\",\n",
       " 'Ate here 2 times during recent stay at Paris. It was nice to have a \"home\" pub that we could go to with good food. Its a little pricey but what do you expect in LV. Seating was bit tight, Maybe not squeeze so many in here. Had the Hanger Steak that was outstanding. This was big enough for 2 people. Could easily split this one. Breakfast was good. Eggs Benedict special was excellent, Ham and Cheese crepe nothing special but OK.\\nWe would definitely come back and recommend. Try to get seating in glass area around the bar if you cannot get on the patio outside.',\n",
       " \"*** Wow, that cheese plate was friggin' good! ***\\n\\nYup, I went to a steakhouse and ordered a three cheese\\nplate and a side of garlic spinach.  The guys called me gay.\\nDid I care?  Hell naw, I was in a pure gastronomical moment ...\\na blue cheese, silky cow milk and a Humbolt cheese were perfect.\\nAdd nuts, dry fruit and honey ... this cheese plate ($16) totally rocked.\\n\\nThe garlic spinach ($7) was tender, not overcooked and quite tasty.\\nThe baguette and raisin toast were also warm, fresh and delectable.\\n\\n*** If all restaurants served sides like this, I could be vegetarian. ***\",\n",
       " \"Good service and friendly staff.\\n\\nIt was good food, but not great. I had the short rib.  the rib was tender and flavorful.  The sides were ok.  \\n\\nI just don't know, it wasn't spectacular and I don't think I would come back for dinner. \\n\\nMy wife said this was a great lunch place I would probably agree based on the lackluster dinner I had.\",\n",
       " 'Gotta hand it to them.. They get packed but can handle the crowd.  The food is excellent and so is the service.  We even sat outside and the heat lamps were sufficient enough for our party of 7.',\n",

       " 'I have no idea what the fuck these people are thinking calling those chips of what could be a potato a \"frite\" - but they are not fucking frites. I know frites, I love frites - those things are more like sheddings of potato dermis.\\n\\nMy steak was mealy. Blech.',\n",
       " \"Great bang for the buck in Vegas. Worth a visit if you are looking for a nice eatery without breaking the bank and getting your money's worth. \\n\\nEscargots - Sauce tasted great, reminded me of muscles. \\n\\nFrisee, Kale & Warm Bacon Salad with soft-poached egg - AWESOME. Not sure why I haven't seen poached egg used a salad dressing until now, but wow. \\n\\nSteak and Fries - Steak is flattened like a flank and tastes great. Get it medium to medium rare since the steak is so thin. Tasted even better 3 hours later, cold. Fries are super crispy and tasty. \\n\\nLamb Burger - It was a special and it was great as well. Funny thing is though, the burger tasted even better the next day for some left overs. \\n\\nGo Go Go!!! It is worth your time if you are looking to drop some money (not too much) and want some refinement. \\n\\nOh yea, service was awesome. Some of the best we've seen anywhere.\",\n",

       " 'In vegas inside the Parisian.  We were a little bit disappointed because we were expecting a great meal.  The meal was good but not great.  The service was average, but the environment was very nice.  The views are nice since you are across the street from the Belagio fountains.',\n",
       " 'Great place for a date, sit out on the patio for the view of the Bellagio fountains, this place is a true gem.',\n",
       " 'We had lunch there and it was all right, nothing to complain about, but nothing to justify more than three stars either. Expensive, like everything at major Vegas hotels.',\n",
       " 'I ate here this past weekend, was extremely delicious. I ordered the smoked salmon I believe & my oh my was it DELICIOUS. I forgot the waitresses name but it was the blonde older lady and her name started with a C. She was so nice & made the experience delightful. She explained the foods, didn\\'t bother us, and was just so darn nice! I\\'m rating 4 stars because when my family and I first arrived, my cousins and I had gone to use the restroom. While we were in the restroom, the rest of my family were already being called to be seated. Normally this is never an issue at ANY restaraunt I have gone too, but maybe this restaraunt is bougie enough to make a big deal out of it. My cousin calls us and tells us to hurry so we rush over. As I\\'m walking in, 2 hostess\\' (both young ladies with black hair) were saying \"why would you come to a restaraunt if the whole party isn\\'t here\" and throwing unnecessary comments around. I normally would\\'ve said something but I wasn\\'t informed on the drama until I sat down with my family. That\\'s when they told me that the ladies were causing an issue because a few of us were in the restroom and even tried testing my aunt saying \"do you even know where the restroom is?\" That\\'s when I remembered the ladies talking. We spoke to the manager about it and she didn\\'t do anything. I wish I would\\'ve got the young girls\\' name because this is a tourist spot. It was my first time but my aunt goes a lot. If it weren\\'t for the good food and great service from our waitress, I would leave 1 star because those ladies from the start made us feel less than what we were.',\n",
       " 'Wandered in for steak and eggs and was not disappointed. I was met with a awesome host who seat me outside under a space heater across from the Hotel.  A huge flank steak with perfect eggs and the most delish toasted baggette. Well worth the $40!',\n",
       " 'We came here as suggested by a local. The view is incredible and watching the fountains is definitely a perk. However, I had to give this restaurant three stars due to the lack of terrible customer service. Our waitress seemed stand offish so I tried to make small chat about things to do in the area and she gave suggestions. However, it did start to rain and when we asked to go inside we kind of got this \"oh you\\'re those types of girls\" kind of feeling. They never offered to open the umbrellas on the patio though. Then as soon as we were inside no one checked on us until it was time to bring the check. My ahi tuna burger was delicious, but had the waitress come by, I would have liked more spicy mayo. The fries are incredible and my friend mentioned they taste like potato sticks - perfectly crunchy and tastefully sinful. So overall, my first restaurant experience in Vegas was subpar. Maybe next time Mon Ami Gabi, maybe next time!',\n",
       " \"Started out with goat cheese with some garlic bread.  Then shared a few plates :\\n\\nThe steak and frites \\nThe lobster roll \\nThe scallops \\n\\n\\nLong story short the steak and lobster were amazing the scallops were bit cold and slimy but they are scallops and that's how it comes. Service was good a bit pricey but it's Vegas get with the program.\",\n",
       " \"Best place in Vegas for breakfast.  Amazing view of the fountains, outside patio with mists and a nice breakfast selection.   My honey got the steak and eggs and didn't speak until he was done...enough said.   I had the corn beef hash and it was nicely prepared but I honestly got full on the toast.   The bread was soooo good, with the lightly salted butter and this jam, oh my!    They make a decent bloody mary but could had used a bit more kick and a lot more salad on top.    This place is also priced well with adequate portions.\\n\\n6 stars for service...our waitress was a sweetheart and although we showed up well past the breakfast hour, she put in a late order for us.\",\n",
       " 'beautiful view if u sit out in the patio!!! \\nfood is good but I wouldnt say top notch.  \\n\\nwe ordered a bunch of things on the menu and shared.  \\n\\na few different types of steaks - some\\nwere more on the salty side, some more on the bland side.  one of the steak was still pretty rare on some parts when we had asked for medium.\\n\\nscallops -- not too shabby\\n\\nseafood platter - on the fresh side.  but nothing special in particular with sauces or anything.  \\n\\nescargot -- very good.  \\n\\nmushroom appetizer with creme cheese ?

       " \"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. We stayed at The Paris and didn't want to treck anywhere far for breakfast.  \\n\\nService - Stellar.\\n\\nReservations - The place was packed at 10 am.  However, most people were waiting for a table on the patio.  If you want to sit inside, the wait was almost nonexistent. \\n\\nFood - Very good.\\n1. Crepe Special - The crepe was your normal spongy and mushy mess.  It had charred crispy edges with a semi soft thin middle.  Served with fresh whipped cream and poached vanilla pears. \\n2. Short Rib Benedict Special - Almost perfect.  Not overly rich or decadent.  It just needed some acidity to give it another dimension.\",\n",
       " \"This is my go-to nice dinner out on the Strip when I'm in Vegas. \\n\\nI always get the filet mignon with merlot butter. It is so fantastic and incredibly tender... I make sure to inhale every last drop. You cannot go wrong ordering this dish. Highly recommend. I'm not a big fan of their fries (which come standard), they are basically like flattened normal fries. I'll try something different next time. \\n\\n We've also gotten the pate each time as an appetizer and that was also excellent. This time we also tried the goat cheese and although it was good, I probably would try something different instead.\\n\\nOne of my dining companions and I wanted to order a bottle of red wine, and when we picked a Malbec off the menu, the waitress suggested a malbec not on the menu for a bit cheaper, which is I appreciated.\\n\\nTotal for my portion of the meal (split apps, steak, and split wine) plus tip was $89. The price makes me super happy, especially if you've ever tried checking out the menu at oh, say, CUT or any other steakhouse on the strip. \\n\\nI made a reservation via Open Table which is only for inside seating. Since the weather was so nice we wanted to sit outside that night and maybe we were lucky, but they were able to take us immediately- at the reservation time- anyway. \\n\\nService here has never been perfect. Maybe we waited a little too long for our check or to get orders taken, but food delivery and water filling was always fine.  \\n\\nOverall I know I can't go wrong with Mon Ami Gabi and always suggest it to friends going to Vegas.\",\n",
       " 'The best little bistro on the strip.  Great views of the Bellagio fountain if you sit outside.  I say \"if\" because one trip it rained and we had to sit indoors.  Who knew that it rained in Vegas?\\n\\nBreakfast, Breakfast, Breakfast.  This is what you do here.  They have an amazing breakfast.  French-inspired.  Get the Eggs Benedict.  I go au naturale and get the style with the Canadian ham, but one trip they had it with smoked salmon.  I am not sure if this is a permanent item, but it was damn good.  Also, grab a Blood Mary.  \\n\\nImagine snacking on perfectly poached eggs resting on top of grilled Canadian ham and piggy-backing on an English muffin.  Now imagine the Bellagio Fountains go off as you take a sip of your Bloody Mary.  \\n\\nLunch and Dinner are great too and you will see more fountain action during this time, but it may be difficult to get a table outside.  Also, you will have to tolerate the transformers, batman, porn slappers, and other craziness on the strip.....because you are right there in the thick of it.\\n\\nI say you reserve this as a place for breakfast.

They are always busy so try to come at off times if you're planning to dine here for lunch or dinner.  I've only been here for lunch on the weekends but I'd definitely recommend this spot to anyone who's never been.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I shared:\\nOnion Soup Au Gratin & Prime Steak Sandwich upon recommendation.\\n\\nThey also give you bread and butter to start off with which is always a plus in my book.\\nI also noticed they had a Bloody Mary Bar in the middle of the restaurant that I thought was interesting.  If I was a bigger Bloody Mary fan I would've been down to try it but perhaps next time.\\n\\nThe Onion Soup Au Gratin was a lot bigger than expected and boy was I glad!  Definitely one of the top French Onion soups I've ever had--the soup had a savory flavor with onions, bread and tons of melted cheese.  The warm bread they bring out to you while you wait, also pairs well with this soup.  Must get!\\n\\nThe Prime Steak Sandwich was amaaaaaazing.  I was so happy I went with this recommendation as it did not disappoint one bit! We asked for our steak to be medium rare and it came out with peppercorn mayo and tons of carmelized onions.  Everything complemented each other and each bite was better than the first.  The steak was so tender and juicy... and the buns they used were warm and soft.  The sandwich also came out with fries too which were good but nothing special.  I actually prefer my fries to be a bit more crispier.  \\n\\nThe service was excellent and there isn't really anything to complain about except I do wish the tables were a bit further apart from each other.  Maybe it's just me but it feels like all the tables are closely set to each other and a bit crammed.  The prices are a bit steep but then again, it is Vegas so it's expected.  I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch.\",\n",

It came with a little bit of yogurt too and the price was great, only 8 bucks.\\n\\n- Complaint about the manager - right when we arrived at the restaurant, she came up with this extremely rude tone and asked if my dog was a service animal (he has a clearly visible vest on saying so). We said yes he was and she laughed and said \"OK, what service does he provide for you then?\" ... It is actually illegal for her to ask that question but she was going to force us to leave and I didn\\'t feel like dealing with security or any drama at the end of my trip so I have her the info. Without saying thank you she just laughed again and said \"fine but keep him off the seats and he cannot eat food.\" We obviously know this as we have trained him and complied with all rules at every other restaurant. First time ever I was treated this way and I wish I knew what her name was so I could report it to upper management, but the rest of the staff were extremely helpful and nice and I will not review my entire experience as bad because of one bad apple.\\n\\nWe will be back, and hope that manager is not there :)',\n",

By 10am on a Saturday, the restaurant was packed! Only patio seating was available so we quickly got seated next to all of the lovely red umbrellas. As I sat down, I couldn't believe my eyes! This was my first introduction to the fountains at the Bellagio. I've eaten at authentic cafés in the real Paris, France, and though the food at Mon Ami Gabi isn't authentic French food, the ambience and view in Vegas tops any street cafe experience I've ever had in France! The Bellagio fountains are truly that spectacular. \\n\\nTo start we had \\nBAKED GOAT CHEESE \\nTomato sauce, warm herb garlic bread \\n\\nEntres were \\nWARM CHICKEN & BRI SANDWICH \\nCaramelized onions, green apple \\n\\nCUBANO\\nMojo-marinated roasted pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, dijon mustard. \\n\\nI found myself putting the baked goat cheese on every bite of my Cubano to intensify with a rich and creamy flavor! I took a bite of the chicken sandwich and thought it was just, ok. Def go for the Cubano! They also make a delicious black licorice flavored absinthe and champaign garnished with a black berry for about $15 a flute. \\n\\nBy the end of the meal, I was melting. Felt like nearly 100 degrees outside. It was time to part ways and take shelter from the sun! The tab for two can range from $50-$60. \\n\\nMon Ami Gabi is a Vegas Go-ers must!

No problem. They\\'re going to bring you a fresh baguette with an amuse-bouche that you\\'ll dream about for months. For an appetizer, get the brie and put it on that delicious bread.

You will not regret it!\\n\\nWhile the view sells it for me, the food and service are pretty great as well. For Vegas, the prices are pretty reasonable. In the past I've done the French Onion Soup and a side salad, which have been perfect. The Goat Cheese appetizer is warm and satisfying, great to snack on with a glass of wine. \\n\\nI landed in Vegas 2 nights ago, and my friend's flight was delayed coming in, so I was on my own for dinner. I immediately knew I would go to Mon Ami Gabi. I bundled up in my winter coat and walked over. I asked for a table outside and was very comfortable under one of the many, many heaters they have out there. My server was incredibly helpful with the wine list as my knowledge of French wine is limited, and I loved what he picked for me. You are immediately presented with a loaf of bread and butter, as well as an amuse buche. Tonight is was green apple and fennel with a mayonnaise dressing (the French really do love their mayo). It was a lovely snack while I debated what I wanted. When the waiter came back, I could not make a decision. I mentioned wanting to try the steak tartare as it is something I've somehow never had, and he said that it was his favorite thing on the menu and I must get it. Not wanting to drop $35 and also not being that hungry, he offered to have them make me a half order as an appetizer and charge half the price. Sold!\\n\\nIt was really delicious, and I am so glad I listened to him. Plus, with the smaller portion and price point, I had room for dessert! Again torn between a few options, I went with his recommendation of the bananas foster crepe. Delicious only begins to explain how good it was. The caramel sauce was decadent and the crepe was light and fluffy. I spent about an hour and a half there, slowly sipping my wine and reading my book while I ate, pausing every 20 minutes or so to watch the amazing fountains across the street (and the people watching isn't bad either :). My server would occasionally stop to check on me, often engaging in some lovely conversation and never making me feel like I should hurry up and leave. \\n\\nA trip to Vegas should always begin with a night on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi!\",\n",

Luckily the food was good enough so that I forgot about the annoyance.  \\n\\nFirst the bread they serve was sooooooooo good.  The bread is a mini baguette roll that  tasted like it just came out of the oven.  5 stars alone for just the bread.\\n\\nWe ordered the 'Escargots de Bourgogne' for our appetizer and we both ordered the Filet Mignon for our entree.  The 'Escargots de Bourgogne' was delicious and our Filet Mignon was even better.  I've been here before but I don't remember what I ordered the previous time.  I also don't remember it being as good as it was this last time.\\n\\nService at Mon Ami Gabi was really good as I was checked up on constantly.  What's best about Mon Ami Gabi is that the price is really reasonable for the food being served.  I would expect to pay a little more...  I will definitely have dinner here again for their delicious tasting Filet Mignon.\",\n",

       " \"Love this place! My favorite time of year to come here is spring so you can sit out on the patio and watch the fountains of Bellagio. I'm not a steak eater but I have to say I really enjoyed my food, especially the steak and frites. One of the best sangrias in town, which I am a sangria connoisseur. Unfortunately they don't take reservations for outside dining, so you may have a little bit of a wait, but next best thing is to sit at the bar, it's sort of outside/inside so you get the best of both worlds.\",\n",

We ordered the baked goat cheese,the macaroni gratin and a caesar salad. Everything was delicious!! I wanted to go there again but my friend insisted on trying different places. I almost went there by myself when she left because it was so good. It is across from the Bellagio fountain so besides people watching (which you can do anywhere in Vegas) there was always a little fountain show going on. Highly recommend!',\n",

Both were really delicious - I was especially surprised by the salad... scarfed the whole thing down quickly!

I live in Boston and every French place I've been to there is better than Mon Ami Gabi.  A French place with no duck on the menu?  Never seen that before.  Look for something else because you can do French better almost anywhere else.  \\n\\nThat being said, it is still serviceable French food and a worthy option if you are in a bind and looking for a nice restaurant at a fairly reasonable price (for Vegas).\",\n",

The service was top notch from the hostess to the server who helped us. I ordered a lobster roll it was tasty and way more than I could manage to finish. The french onion soup was also quite good (a pretty big bowl too). For desert we had the bananas foster holy cow it was so good but way too big.. more for like 3 people. I will be coming back to this restaurant for sure next time I'm in town. Can't beat awesome service!\",\n",
       " \"Mon Ami Gabi gets the biggest meh on the planet.  And I really wanted to like this place because I lost my virginity to a woman named Gabi.\\n\\nBread was fine.  Good bread, really.  But even italian restaurants in Iowa give you some pepper and parm to add to the oil you're dipping it in.\\n\\nEscargots were bad.  Lacking flavor, under seasoned, and 17 bucks for 1.2 ounces of snail meat just isn't a good deal.  Only good thing is that once you ate the snails you could dip some of your leftover bread in the snail sauce and the bread absorbed enough of the flavor that it wasn't bad.  If this is the best they can do on snail meats they should honestly take them off the menu.  I could do better than this at home.  And I've never even seen a snail.\\n\\nScallops I had were okay but not great.  Tasted surprisingly fishy for scallops.  It wasn't necessarily a bad fishy taste, but wasn't something I was used to at a nice restaurant.  Seemed weird.\\n\\nMy gf ordered a steak and it was good but I thought this place was French.  It's not like they're gonna beat Craft or a dozen other places on steak.\\n\\nSides were pretty meh.  We had the rat one, plus pommes puree.  They're relatively cheap (6 bucks vs 11+ at some places) but they also weren't that great.  I guess they're rated okay, given the relatively low price.\\n\\nBottom line is I'd go elsewhere.  You can do better at this sort of mid tier vegas price.\",\n",

       " \"The food here are delicious. The soup of the day was yummy goodness. The bread came with this vinegar carrot dressing that was refreshing and delicious at the same time. Most of us at the table ordered the steak and they were tender and awesome. Other people at our table also got crab cake and the scallops. From what I heard they were all good. \\n\\nWe seated inside and the decor was really nice. I wish we can seated outside though since the patio area have a great view of the Bellagio fountain. We didn't have to wait for a long time since we got reservation. The waiter service was alright, however, it wasn't that good either, it was just decent.\",\n",

Been to Vegas many times and have done it all, but now in my old age, I look forward to the food options.\\nVisited this French restaurant about 10 years ago, and this time I took my boyfriend.\\nIt was HOT!!! but managed to get a table in the shade, under the umbrellas and the mist that sprays from the railing. This is a great spot for people watching!!!\\nWe had good service. The gal that sat us was very chatty. Our service, a nice young man, not overly friendly but efficient.\\nI ordered what I ordered when I came many moons ago, full size order of muscles, with came with thin frites. We also ordered the warm brie with honey, and a fruit bowl, which was a carved cantaloupe filled with fruit.\\nThe warm brie with honey came with roasted garlic pieces, whole hazelnuts, and 4 crustini. My boyfriend is not a huge fan of brie, but he certainly loved this! He also liked the fries. His fruit was good, and the fresh bread, mini loaf they give you, is freshly baked on the premises and is so good. \\nSo if you can't make it to gay paris, this may be the closest you can come. Of course they aren't as snobby as the french can be (so I've heard). If you are a french foodie snob and have been to Paris, or France, maybe not your cup of tea, but for the rest of this, will do.  Pricey yes, but well worth the money.\",\n",

       " 'I have only agreed to come here on my husband\\'s insistence because he claimed that they must have had an off night when we were here last year and my medium rare Beef Wellington -- something I was really looking forward to trying -- turned out to be a dried up piece of meat wrapped in dehydrated pastry. After all, this is such a popular place! \"Of course\", I said, \"perhaps it WAS an off night, after all.\" But as it turned out, OFF is  a permanent condition here at Mon Ami Gabi...\\n\\nI really, really, really wanted to like this place both times I ate here. It has a very cosy main dining room and of course, what can be better than sitting out on the patio people watching and enjoying the view of the fountains.  And lucky us: without even trying, we snagged a patio table on a sunday night! Then a  beautiful crusty baguette with slightly sweet butter was brought out and things started looking even better! However, that\\'s where out luck ended, because then they brought out the rest of the food. And it wasn\\'t good. At all! \\n\\nMy soup du jour-- lentils with duck confit -- smelled like a Sephora store on a busy afternoon. There is just no explanation for an extremely strange perfume-y smell that was hitting my nose every time I tried to put a spoon of that soup in my mouth. A shame, because the flavor was quite nice... perhaps I should have tried holding my nose while eating...\\n\\nNext came the scallops: another huge disappointment. They were fishy! No self-respecting restaurant should have let that dish leave their kitchen... My guess is they were either frozen or stored in sodium tripolyphosphate, which makes them appear nice and juicy but completely alters their taste. Ugh! \\n\\nMy husband\\'s main course -- lamb -- had great potential, but was completely under seasoned. Another bummer! Needless to say, we chose not to order desert...',\n",

Bizarre, perhaps, but a lifelong tradition I have no interest in stopping any time soon.\\n\\nOn my most recent trip, my friend and I were discussing which wonderful, carnivorous eatery to frequent.  I mentioned a couple of my long-time favorites, and she countered with Mon Ami Gabi.\\n\\nHer selling point was excellent steak on a budget.  Fair enough, I'm always up for trying something new.  \\n\\nWe had a reservation and were seated promptly.  They let us choose between indoor or outdoor seating.  It was 10 million degrees outside (no exaggeration!) so we opted for inside.  The setting was quaint, very bistro-in-the-real-paris-with-much-higher-ceilings.  Our waiter was *awesome*.  He excelled at flirting 101, but not in an annoying way.\\n\\nWe both ordered the steak frites.  The beef was good, the sauce (you get to choose one) was disappointing (I had the bordelaise) and I was glad I ordered it on the side.  My friend loved her mushroom sauce.  The fries were amazing.  Possibly the best ever.\\n\\nOther selling points: I wasn't in a wine mood, as I had already had a couple of drinks elsewhere before dinner, and our waiter poured me a glass on the house.  The carrot tapenade and baguette were fabulous.  There were nickel slots outside the front door.  Okay, nix the last one.\\n\\nTo sum it up, good steak, good price, not my favorite in Vegas... but Daniel is now my favorite waiter in all of Nevada.\\n\\nFinally, I wish I could comment on dessert, but I was determined to have my Vegas cheesecake at Carnegie Deli after Crique de Soleil.  So no dessert was had.\",\n",

We were way too hungry and lazy and to be honest, just wanted to sit our asses down and be served. So we walked around looking for other places to dine that weren't so packed when we discovered this cute little restaurant hiding in the corner. \\n\\nWe got an amazing table outside on the patio on the most gorgeous Vegas day. It was already a fantastic start to a delicious meal. The service was great too. Our waitress was very cute and so friendly, she made us feel right at home. \\n\\nWe started with their Fruit Bouquet, which I had seen on several other tables. It was a beautifully carved cantaloupe filled with melon, grapes and pineapple that came with sides of creme fraiche, mint syrup and brown sugar. YUM. A perfect way to start breakfast. The fruit was so fresh and the little accompaniments paired perfectly. I personally loved the pineapple with the mint syrup and the cantaloupe with the creme fraiche. \\n\\nFor our entrees my bf chose the Egg, Bacon & Cheese crepe with some added avocado on top. I chose the special Benedict of the day which came with spinach, tomato and bacon on a toasted sourdough muffin with a chive hollandaise. We also had to get a side order of the frites, they just looked so good!\\n\\nEverything was absolutely delicious. The crepe was perfectly cooked, really melted in your mouth. The cheese was chewy while the crepe was delicate, and the egg and bacon rounded all the flavors out very nicely. The avocado that my bf added also was a nice touch!\\nMy benedict was very good, the eggs were cooked perfectly which is a huge plus. Almost every benedict I get at a restaurant has over-cooked poached eggs, but these were nice and runny. Mmm! They weren't kidding about the 'toasted' muffin though. Mine was definitely a little more well-done than I would have liked but it was still yummy. I loved the muffin because it had a really distinct sourdough taste that went well with the rest of the Benedict flavors. \\n\\nThe frites were also tasty. We could barely finish just one order because it was so big. Don't be fooled, it looks all cute and small in that little paper cone but it seems practically bottomless. Keep in mind though these are not typical fries, they are very thinly cut and fried until crispy then topped with a good amount of salt. If you like really crispy potatoes then you will love these. Otherwise, if you want regular french fries don't bother. \\n\\nDefinitely a great experience for both of us and we were both so lucky to come on such a beautiful day. Will definitely try to come back next time I'm in town!\",\n",

When we got to the table they brought us an amuse bouche of orzo salad (yum) and their french bread...warm, crusty, oh-so-satisfying.\\nWe started our meal with a few drinks and also ordered the baked cheese. So, so good....I am craving it right now. It\\'s basically a mixture of soft cheeses (cream cheese, goat cheese, etc.) that are baked in the oven, mixed with fresh marinara sauce, and served with toasted french bread drizzled in basil garlic oil. There were only two of us and we basically licked the bowl clean...it was that good.\\nFor our meals we both got the signature filet mignon with merlot butter and red wine reduction. I got the asparagus for my side and my friend got the fries. The portions were surprisingly large and the meat was impeccably cooked. The filet was soft and well seasoned....melted in my mouth. Without a doubt, the best steak I have ever had (and funnily enough also one of the cheapest). The asparagus was fresh and delicious. I also stole quite a few fries from across the table...those things are addictive. \\nWe ended the meal with creme brulee. The custard was sweet and creamy and rich....exactly what I wanted. \\nOverall, a fantastic meal. I couldn\\'t pick out a single flaw (and I can almost always pinpoint more than one). During our meal I looked around the nearby tables and picked up on a few conversations, and everyone was commenting on how spectacular the food and service were...lots of happy people and bellies.

We had not had a chance to come back but always wanted to and we finally made it a point of returning this year to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. We were excited, however, unfortunately the experience left us disappointed and wishing we\\'d gone to one our other favorites in Las Vegas that we know would have met our expectations. \\n\\nFirst of all, the food was very good and the chef staff deserves some credit. They sent out a small comp dessert which was also nice. The view and the ambience is also very nice. Those two things are the only reason for 2 star rating. \\n\\nHowever, the service staff, leaves much to be desired. Our server and the busser were very unfriendly and could not care less that this was a special occasion for us and they did not treat us well at all. They were short, unfriendly, and uncaring.  It was as if our patronage was an inconvenience to them. \\n\\nTo make it worse, we ordered escargot appetizer, a caesar salad, wine, and entrees, and they forgot to bring the salad and then brought our entrees instead.  We ended up just accepting the mistake and taking the entrees because at this point we just wanted to eat and leave. To make it even worse, when the server came over, we had to tell her of the mistake and she didn\\'t apologize or seem to care and had an \"oh well, I don\\'t really care\" attitude about it. Then she disappeared for 20 minutes and never checked in on us again until our meal was completely finished. \\n\\nAgain, food and ambience was good, but service was horrible and very disappointing. Whether an anniversary special occasion or not, the service was unacceptable. The price alone for this meal demands a much higher level of service. You pay for fine dining to receive high quality food and high quality service. \\n\\nNeedless to say, unfortunately, and I say unfortunately because this place had a special memory for us and we had high hopes of coming back, but we will not return. Wish I could go back in time and redo this special night at a different restaurant.',\n",

       " \"Just had a birthday lunch for my wife's 50th birthday. \\n\\nWe had reservations which made seating quick and easy., even though the place was really packed. \\n\\nThe waitress Christina was fantastic,  unfortunately,  her busboy was awful. We had to ask 3 times to get bread and soda refills.  We could see the busboy who often appeared to be looking off into space even though we tried to get his attention by waving and calling to him.  Christina was very apologetic and ended up getting the bread and soda herself. \\n\\nEveryone at the table enjoyed their food except for me.   I ordered the filet cooked medium and doubled checked how it was prepared to ensure I wouldn't have to send it back. Wouldn't you know it, it was over cooked.   Christina took it back,  but it was replaced with one that was rare.   Given that most of my party had nearly finished and I was starving  I chose to eat part of it and left the really rare part on the plate. Again Christina was profusely apologetic and it was removed from our bill. \\n\\nOverall, the staff took care of everything especially Christina and the manager.  The only thing I was surprised about is that while the gratuity was added in because of our party size, the gratuity was included for 2 filets even though they took them off the bill.\\n\\nThe end result.  Pretty good food and a great waitress, just don't order filet when it is busy if you are expecting it to be cooked as ordered.\",\n",

       " 'Mixed feelings about this place. Based on the reviews I thought it was going to be incredible, but was sadly disappointed. Visited with a group of 4.\\n\\nThe Good: The french onion soup was delicious. Cute interior and decor. Comped some of our meal after issues were brought up.\\n\\nThe Neutral:\\n- Refused to seat our party of 4 despite a reservation because 2 of our party was missing. We wanted to order for all 4 people in advance... not sure why this was an issue (we were going to order for all so as to not keep the table longer than necessary) but I understand that\\'s their policy so will keep that one neutral.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n- Seating is large inside but very tight. My mother got knocked HARD on the back of the head with a plate by a waiter walking past fast (she was woozy and had a headache after) and also got bumped twice more on the back of the head with elbows/backs etc by passing waiters. Did not seem like it was a weird event as we saw it happen to others. Aisles should be bigger or waiters should be more careful. We were tucked in as much as possible. Beware!\\n- Our food took much longer than all the other  tables around us. We were very friendly  and polite the whole time so didn\\'t seem like it was us, but we were definitely forgotten. Waiter and manager came by to apologize.\\n- Crepe machine was broken so could not order crepes.\\n- Grapefruit juice was \"off\" -- and I\\'m pretty tolerant of bad gf juice!\\n- My nutella waffles tasted good, but we had to request syrup. Others ordered blueberry waffles and french toast -- blueberries were frozen SOLID and cold, and french toast was raw batter on the outside.\\n\\nPerhaps we ordered the wrong things here or just had an off day. Would not return.',\n",
       " 'I absolutely loved the view at Mon Ami Gabi. We were fortunate enough to get a seat outside and the vegan protest in the view we encountered, only added to the experience. I did not give this 4 stars due to the service. I don\\'t know if our waiter was avoiding our table purposely, but I did feel like we had to flag him down a few times in order to get service. If the case was that he was overwhelmed, then that is an issue the restaurant needs to address. We had a group of 5, so gratuity was already added to our check, so maybe he did not feel the need to work for it and be a bit more attentive to the table. He also seemed to be a bit rushed when he was taking our order. Not to mention, the \"secret service\" (probably the floor manager) standing by our table throughout the duration of our meal. It was just a bit cramp to have him hoovering the entire time. \\n\\nThe meal was ok. I had the Beef Wellington, but was not pleased with it. The best part of eating in a group is being able to sample a variety of dishes at one time. Our appetizer: Warm Triple Cheese was delicious beyond words. My sister had the Salmon which was also tasty. My friend had the Hanger Steak...arguably the best thing at the table. We had Chocolate Mousse and Caramel Crème Brulee for dessert. The Brulee was the better of the two.',\n",

The waiter messed up the orders and brought one meal before the others and before the appetizer. Then they brought an appetizer salad with the meal. The steak orders were wrong, the soup and fries were cold. Even our after dinner coffee was cold. We were not rude about what was wrong but wanted things warm and Instead of the waiter attempting to fix the errors, he got snippy and threw the check at us. Not an experience that is acceptable at any restaurant much less at a high end place like this.',\n",

The wait wasnt that bad actually because we went on a Monday night.\\n\\nI got the onion soup and it was my first time having it. I was expecting it to be jam packed with flavor but I personally didnt think it was that great. The layer of cheese onion on top was too thick and I just thought it was a weird combo. I got the Filet Mignon for $32 and split with a friend since we didnt want to be bloated before heading out. The meat was super tender and tasted very buttery. I loved the frites because they were so fried and delicious. Id much rather have that than huge pieces of potatoes.\\n\\nThe atmosphere and the ambiance was great and the food was good but overpriced. \\n\\n**TIPS**\\n1) I would skip out on the onion soup unless you like really like it.\\n2) Dress to impress when you go here :)\\n3) Enjoy!',\n",

We didn't have the reservation but they sat us down quickly. It was a big restaurant with traditional European decorations. We started out with drinks. I enjoyed my Frangria while my friend was served with their bloody mary bar. Our first plate was the mussels, which was cooked in a creamy and rich sauce. It was perfect! Definitely one of the best mussels that I have had. It was followed by my main entree, chicken and mushroom crepe. The crepe was also excellent. The filling of mushroom and chicken was well balanced with the light creamy sauce. The crepe was thin but flavorful. Overall, we all enjoyed our plates and were ready for our Vegas trip. The location of this place is also a selling point. It is right across from the fountain of Bellagio. If you come during the late afternoon or evening, you can enjoy their famous fountain show right from the restaurant.\",\n",

The yelp reviews are pretty much spot on- great food, drinks at reasonable prices (relatively speaking- hey, this is Vegas!) We started with the escargot appetizer and very warm crusty bread and two glasses of red wine, followed by two steak dinners. Everything was delicious and the the service was top notch and friendly. \\n\\nSome advice- try to get here early if you can or call ahead and make a reservation.

We sat right by the opening to the outside tables, facing the water show at Bellagio so we had entertainment, too.  It all made for a very enjoyable dining experience.

       " 'I told myself not to write this review until a day had gone by so here it is. My boyfriend and I were walking around Las Vegas Blvd when we came across this restaurant. We had our pup with us so I decided to go in and ask if he could eat with us in their outdoor seating area. I went in and asked one of the hostesses if our dog could eat with us if we sit outside and she said \"Um, yeah for how many people?\" And I said two. Then she said it will be an hour wait for outside. So I went back outside to ask my boyfriend if the wait time was fine and he said ok, so I went back in and told the same hostess that we would wait, so she took my name down and gave us a buzzer. After patiently waiting for a little over an hour our buzzer goes off, so I give it to the same hostess that took my name down. She looks down at my dog who is standing right next to me and says \"Um, is that a service dog? Because we don\\'t allow dogs here\"...... I then said \"I asked you if we could eat outside with our dog before you took my name down\". A hostess standing next to her then says to me \"She wasn\\'t here an hour ago\". LOL what?!!!! I was absolutely LIVID. They were basically calling me a liar. Why would I make that up and purposefully wait an entire hour when I have better things to do while on vacation. How dare they??? I remained really calm, which I now regret. I wish I would have cursed them out, I really do. If she wasn\\'t there an hour ago then I must have been talking to her effing twin. EVEN IF they were right (which they were not) and I had asked a different hostess, someone still told me I could bring my dog!!! After the manager came out she told me it was against their health code to let dogs eat in the restaurant, even if it\\'s outdoors, which is totally fine but why was I not told this before waiting a fucking hour?? \\n\\nManager lady, please check your surveillance cameras for 03/09/2015 around 12:30pm and tell me again that the same hostess did not take my name down. I DARE YOU. And I hope you reprimand your hostess for lying to a customer right to her face.\\n\\nAvoid this disgusting and dishonest place. They have a staff of liars working here.',\n",
       " \"Mon Ami Gabi, I hyped you up way too much in my head. I almost feel guilty giving you three stars as fellow Yelpers below seemed to have had an amazing experience here. \\n\\nFirst off, our waiter was super rude! I guess since we came as a party of 6 and gratuity was included in the bill maybe he felt he didn't need to provide top notch service to us. Our water was refilled once, he seemed upset having to make two separate trips back for napkins and extra bread and he even gave us the bill before we looked at the dessert menu...in fact, if it wasn't for the service we received, I probably would have bumped it up to 4 stars...\\n\\nNow onto the meal, I ended up ordering the filet mignon merlot $37, a seafood starter platter $55 which included a lobster, salmon tartare, shrimp cocktail (4) and fresh oysters (4) as well as two orders of escargot. Now the escargot wasn't bad, however it seemed we had more olive oil than actual pesto in it. The filet mignon was cooked almost perfectly but the fries it came with I could've done without. The seafood platter was the winner, the lobster and oysters were very fresh, the shrimp was good but the salmon tartare needed something more. I guess it's hard to compare when I've only had salmon tartare in Portugal. \\n\\nFor dessert, our table shared a caramel creme brûlée which was amazing. The dessert was 5 star worthy! If you tell them it's your birthday they also bring out a small ice cream dessert. \\n\\nOverall, this place wasn't bad. Perhaps I came on an off day. I don't think I'd come back to the same waiter if I dined here again but other than the service, everything else was pretty good!\",\n",

The restaurant was super busy that Saturday brunch, but our waitress was on top of everything and very friendly.\\n\\nI had a wonderful quiche Lorraine, which was the whole quiche (!) and clearly cooked to order, which was a nice surprise. A tablemate had a burger, which he said was fantastic, and the wine list was shockingly reasonably priced.\\n\\nThe only downside was the overall price of the menu. I get that it's Las Vegas and it's on the Strip, but we had just come Le Diplomate in Washington, DC, which we also think is pricey, and even that seemed comparatively tame in comparison with LV's Strip prices. But hey, it's still cheaper than the flight to France!\",\n",

We had shown up 10 minutes late and there was a line, they seated us right away and asked if it was our first time there.

You will be seated directly across from the Bellagio, so I'm not sure what's better than enjoying amazing food while watching their fountain show. \\n\\nOn this past long weekend trip to Vegas, I actually ate at Mon Ami Gabi twice in almost as many days.  My girlfriends and I went for dinner on a weeknight, and even for indoor seating had about a 30 minute wait.  But, totally worth it.  This was my first time eating dinner here, and let me tell you--it was delicious!  I opted for one of their Prime Steak Frites--the Au Poivre, which is with brandy peppercorn sauce.  The beef was delicious and tender, and the brandy peppercorn sauce was divine.  The beef had been pounded very long and thin, but man my mouth is watering just thinking of it.  Instead of frites, our waiter informed me I could have mashed potatoes--get the mashed potatoes!  Oh so buttery and delicious. \\n\\nI was also impressed with the bread that came with the meals.  They served the bread with shredded carrots marinated in something, and as odd as it sounds, it was absolutely delicious on the bread!  My two girlfriends also enjoyed their meals--one also had a Prime Steak Frites and another had the caramelized sea scallops. \\n\\nTwo days later, my brother picked me up for breakfast, and this is always his first choice as to where to go on the Strip.  I've been several times prior for breakfast, and have always enjoyed it.   This time, I enjoyed the french toast and instead of blueberries opted for strawberries.  Delicious!  My brother had a ham and cheese crepe--it was good, but he said next time he would get the french toast instead.  \\n\\nService is always excellent at Mon Ami Gabi!  I highly recommend you go to this restaurant and enjoy an amazing meal with a great view on the strip!\",\n",

It was a great choice!!  I called in earlier that evening around 830pm and made reservations for two. I was very surprised that they still accepted reservations the night of! It was definitely a good idea since there were people waiting when we got there at 10pm. One of the Asian hostesses was a bit rude towards me since she asked me to get in the back of the line when I was obviously there before other guests. But I just let that go. \\n\\nWhen we walked into the restaurant it was very crowded. Most, if not all of the tables were occupied. I was under the impression that it was casual atire, but people were dressed rather nice. We sat indoors. The ambiance is rather romantic with slightly dim lights. The atmosphere seemed lively yet relaxed at the same time with people conversing and having a merry time. Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. He gave us advice on what to order which worked out wonderfully!!\\n\\nWe ordered the ESCARGOTS DE BOURGOGNE(oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter) and FILET MIGNON MERLOT(steak with butter and red wine reduction, served with their signature hand-cut frites). Both were very good. I've had snails before but never cooked this way. We ate it with the fresh warm bread! The steak was soooo TENDER!!! By far the best steak I have eaten! Seasoned perfectly and it is like butter when you cut into it. The Frites were also very good and a different spin on fries. I actually like it better than fries because they are thinner and crispier. I am sad that I decided not to order dessert here because I wanted to try Serendipity(no bueno). The total came out to be only $50. What a great deal for such delicious food! I will be coming back no doubt when I am in Vegas :)\",\n",

With all of the amazing restaurant options Vegas has to offer, I can't justify giving this place a 4 but I would rank it as a 3.5. The food is solid and the price point is very fair for a restaurant on the strip with such a great view.\\n\\nI came here for lunch and there's a nice selection of crepes, sandwiches, and lunch entrees. The french fries here are the super thin crunchy kind so that was one of my favorites.\",\n",

Just ate lunch here a little while ago. \\n\\nI ordered the Steak Frites. A staple dish of the restaurant that every other table had someone eating. Its a thin steak rich in flavor alone, but amplified by one of their 4 signature sauces. The waiter recommended the bordelaise sauce, caramelized onions in a red wine sauce. Great pick, it was amazing. Next time I will try the brandy peppercorn sauce! Other dishes at my table were the warm chicken and brie sandwich and the prime steak sandwich. Both looked delicious, particularly the Chicken and Brie.\\n\\nThe cool thing about this restaurant is that it is in the Paris hotel overlooking the Bellagio across the street. You can eat outside on the elevated patio away from all the foot traffic. So while you are eating a beautiful meal, you are at the same time in the middle of the strip possibly watching the Bellagio water fountain show. \\n\\nThe food, service and scenery causes sensory overload. Bring your date here if you want to seal the deal.\",\n",

This time I tried their beat and goat cheese salad....perfect blend of sweet and salty taste each ingredient all around.  We had a party of four and half our party came late.  They wouldn't seat us until our whole party arrived.  I was worried our reservation would get canceled because they were nearly 30 minutes late past our reservation, but they seated us during prime time.   Thank you once again for a wonderful time.  Until next time.\",\n",

The fruit bouquet had fruit that was ripe, so I not disappointed, which can happen with fruit. The crepe \"the skinny pancake\" with apricot, the special for today was just the right amount of sweet. I normally don\\'t like a crispy bacon, but I enjoyed the thick cut of bacon. The musicians close by playing guitar very well and the fountains across the street just made the meal. The servers were attentive too. Underneath the heater we had a great breakfast experience. I will be back.',\n",

The outside seating provides an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains that cannot be matched. I had a pasta from here the last time I went, and I have yet to stop raving about it. It was the best pasta I have ever eaten in my life. Never have I tasted something so scrumptious and such a genuine flavor that I have never tasted before. The servers are always very effective and helpful. Even with the extreme amount of people, the service is grade A. I was amazed with my experience here.',\n",

I mean, just go get a drink at the Eiffel tower bar while you wait. Service was great, food was even better. For drinks I had a glass of their sparkling Rose and then a glass of the Frangria. The frangria as pleasantly NOT watered down or too fruity and also probably the cheapest drink on the menu :) For an appetizer I had a small portion of the mussels - delicious. I also tried someone else's baked goat cheese. AMAZING. Another person in our party got the duck confit and that too looked amazing. For my main dish I went with the lobster roll. Huge chunks of lobster and the most delicious, perfectly baked bun. Came with a little side salad and their fries are something else. I'm typically not a fries person, but their's are great. No ketchup or dipping sauce needed. A little pricey for lunch, but honestly everything in Vegas is pricey that's not fast food.\",\n",

Holler!!!!!    Don't forget to dip your baguettes in the escargo garlic butter.  Tremendous meal.  Incredible service. They sang to my beautiful wife happy birthday and made my sons and friends join in.  Gorgi was our waitress and there is none better.  Every suggestion she offered we took and she was spot on right.  She talked me out of my usual seafood crepe and was I ever glad to try something different.  Love the service.  Love the food. And dessert was bananas fosters crepes.

Yes you can do business in Vegas between the entertainment and adventures lol.\\n\\nOverall absolutely great place to eat. I highly recommend and I will return next time I am in Vegas.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE\\nThe inside is just a little dark with low lighting which was ok but hard to see the menu for some people. They also have outside seating if you wanted that. Might be nice not in July for me personally. The seating was comfortable and the tables were large enough for all of our meals and sides. The interior is designed very well with an little old school steakhouse feel with dark woods and light colored furnishings. It was a very comfortable but upscale French Steakhouse.\\n\\nSERVICE\\nOur server was absolutely amazing. I wish I had written his name down as I did not have to pay this bill (thank goodness! 5 big guys in a steakhouse is not cheap). The server had a french accent which was neat it added to the atmosphere. He was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the foods. He was also a really good salesmen as well taking opportunities to up sell or add on sell us. He did it in a fun way that tied into our group and our conversations. He did not do it in a cheesy or pushy way it was pretty cool. We all joked we should have him working in our store but he make to much money working here lol. GREAT SERVICE! \\n\\nFOOD\\nWe skipped the appetizers this trip as we were in a hurry for dinner. However, they do have this bread in a bag with butter they give it. The bread was very good. Crispy outside, soft and warm inside and plenty for the table. \\n\\nThe food was absolutely amazing. I had the 22 oz bone on ribeye with a bearnaise sauce and these little strips of potato. The steak was cooked perfect and one of the top steaks I ever eaten in my life. The right amount of fat, texture, and natural beef flavor the light seasoning pulled out was amazing. The flavor was great already and then the sauce was great for dipping. They also have different sauces you can have your steak with as well. I just love bearnaise sauce.\\n\\nWe also shared a few sides. The sauteed mushrooms were good. The others tried the roasted potato carrots and enjoyed them. I did not try them. The one side that was better than expect was the cauliflower potato mash. Very good when its warm just like all cooked cauliflower mashes when they get cold not so good. This was great though! \\n\\nMy peers had hanger steaks and filet mignon and all were outstanding. We did not have a bad thing on our table. \\n\\nThey also had a huge selection of alcohol and wines which we did not sample to provide feedback.\\n\\nPRICE VALUE VS FOOD QUALITY \\nThis is a medium priced steakhouse for Las Vegas. The prices can be high in Vegas as everyone knows who has traveled there. However, the food quality and portion size for the price is absolutely reasonable and well worth the stay. Our same meal at another steakhouse that week was almost double and the food was actually better here.',\n",

We did not have reservations because we already had made reservations for another steakhouse for Saturday but we were craving steaks on Friday so of course we came here.\\n\\nThe wait time was about 35 minutes and when we were seated, we were helped right away.

Though the Vegas heat was at an oppressive 100+ degrees, the misters and umbrellas did a decent job keeping us from overheating. The bread is phenomenal. Our appetizers were great. But the dishes we paid the most for ended up being the most underwhelming. \\n\\nThe appetizers that were a hit were the oysters, which were plump, fresh, and super refreshing, and the moules frites, though, I give more credit to the bread for that as it was the main vehicle in which we enjoyed the moules frites since the fries were just so-so. \\n\\nThe seared tuna salad is definitely one to avoid. The seafood crepe had great scallops on the plate, but the shrimp tough and extremely overcooked. The best of the entrees was the open faced crab salad sandwich which was great for such a hot day, and unlike the seared tuna salad, seasoned well. I got sweetness from the crab, creaminess from the avocado, and bite from the thousand island dressing that boasted some really delicious chopped cornichons. \\n\\n$50 per person and we had drinks (iced tea and french 75s).',\n",

       " \"Until last night I had only been to Mon Ami Gabi for business lunches.  We'd sit on the patio overlooking the strip and I'd order good food, but be green with envy of all the people who were there just for the pleasure of it.  I adore my clients and enjoy their company very much, but lets face it, its not the same as a cozy, romatic dinner for two.\\n\\nI didn't get the romance last night, but did have dinner on the patio with another client, who I also consider a friend.  We got there around 6:30 and were seated on the patio after just a few minutes wait.  We apparently arrived just in time because it was packed.  Like other yelpers have mentioned, there's great people watching because you are literally sitting right above the strip.......and having the water fountains at Bellagio across the street adds to the ambience and uniqueness of being in Las Vegas.  Unfortunately we only got to see one show because the wind interferred.   But the wind (I'd call it more of a breeze) felt great and the weather was perfect.  We ordered a bottle of Sancerre, which always makes me happy, and it was the perfect wine to enjoy underneath the setting sun (hmmmmm, this does sound kind of romantic, doesn't it?).  For an appetizer, we ordered the steamed artichoke, which was very good with a lemon mayo for dipping and for dinner I had the scallops atop a cauliflower mash and spinach.  My friend had the skate, which was perfect too.  We also ordered a side of roasted beets, which is where the one slip up happened with us.  Our server forgot to bring it until we were pretty much through with dinner, so they didn't charge us for it.....and it was yummy. \\n\\nFinding a fabulous meal in Las Vegas is very easy.  Finding one that doesn't cost over $100 per person is not.  Our total dinner came out to around $150 including the wine and the tip.  What adds to this being such a great value is that it is one of the only places (that I know of) where you can sit outside right on Las Vegas Boulevard.  If you are in Las Vegas for vacation, then this will certainly enhance that feeling of being in the center of things.  There's Trader Vic's next door, but its a totally different vibe....more of a lounge/bar than a restaurant patio.\",\n",

As for the steak, i had ordered medium rare. Come out a little more towards medium to medium well. Didn\\'t really give it too much thought. The cut was quite thin. To get it seared on each side and edges, already puts it quite cooked. The bearnaise sauce was pretty good. Creamy, slighty sour, bright flavored sauce. Matched the steak pretty well. The hand cut fries were thinly cut and fried. Given a large amount. I dont think i finished it\\n\\nOverall, for the price of everything, the view, and the ambiance and experience.

I could tell my hubby was a little envious of my filet mignon, he opted to save $10 and go with a cheaper cut (what a sweetie) so I made sure to give him plenty of bites. The mashed potatoes were the perfect compliment to my meat.

However, my friends decided to take me here as part of a recent birthday brunch, and I am glad they did. The food was good, and our server super sweet and attentive. I will say this Mon Ami Gabi is pricey! But what isn't in Vegas. With that said, the portion sizes were good and we each left full. I went with a simple burger that I had them cover in grilled mushrooms; it was cooked very well. The fries are super shredded which is a bit weird for those of us who order fries and expect... well... a basic plate of fries, but as I said, I am a simple kinda gal. Oh and the most important treat, Mon Ami Gabi offers, a great view of the water show at the Bellagio directly across the street! So even though a bit fancy for my taste Moni Ami Gabia offers a good plate of food and very strong mimosas. I would say it is worth checking out. Happy Food Hunting!\",\n",

My husband was kind enough to order GF apple cinnamon waffles because I wanted a taste this came with fresh sauté apples and homemade whip creme again fantastic!! They blow me away!!

It's one of the gems on the strip where the quality of the food far outweighs the price that you pay for it. \\n\\nI always order the Croque Monsieur (around $13 and a couple of people could split the plate). Frankly, it's so delicious that I never have the desire to stray from it. It's wonderfully toasted and the combination of cheese and ham are present in the perfect ratio so either flavor isn't too over-whelming. The hand-cut fries that are included with the plate are seasoned and fried to perfection! \\n\\nMy most recent visit was particularly memorable. Mark Z. was our server and he was extremely attentive, pleasant, and actually cared about having a conversation with us (quite refreshing considering we are in our early 20's). We showed up around 9am on a Sunday and were able to be seated right away on the patio which had a direct view of the Bellagio fountains. \\n\\nWe started our meal with the baked goat cheese (about $12) and I can definitely say that I will never skip ordering this delicious plate from this point on. The tomato sauce was perfectly thick and creamy, the goat cheese was some of the best I have ever tasted, and the generous serving of garlic bread was perfectly buttery and crispy. My mouth is literally watering just thinking about it! \\n\\nMy boyfriend said the coffee that he ordered was some of the best he has ever tasted... so that's highly recommended! \\n\\nAll in all, this place is absolutely incredible and I recommend it to every single person that I know that is taking a Vegas vacation!

Our hotel shuttle dropped us off at the Mirage and we trekked for what seemed like miles (Strip was jam-packed with moderately drunken revelers) until we spotted the red awning. We were famished and decided not to request a patio table - had enough of the riff raff  and wanted a quieter setting. It was hopping at 6:45pm so I'm glad I made that reservation! Quickly shown our table, bread plopped down in a timely manner, martini was ice cold (Yay! I'm a fan.) and server was attentive throughout. We both had salads (she the house, me the pear endive). She had the salmon, I had the steak bordelaise. Her fish was melt-in-your-mouth perfect. My steak was okay, not as great as I'd hoped it would be. Couldn't be bothered with the frites, would rather have a seasonal vegetable, but whatever. After a second martini (Yay! I'm a little tipsy.), the bill came to around $125.00, gratuity included. For a special treat, Mon Ami Gabi is worth it. Would definitely return.\",\n",

Breakfast or dinner.  It's all doable.  Upside to this is there cheapest item on the menu ($12.95) which the burger is to die for, and so is everything else on the menu.

If you sit outside on the patio, you'll have a great view of the fountains at the Bellagio and plenty of people watching in the meantime. \\n\\n The prices are pretty reasonable given the location ($25 steak+fries) and the food does a reasonable job of representing the sort of fare you'd expect in a french cafe if it were cooked by an american chef that had learned to prepare the food by reading the menu. \\n\\n The service on my latest visit was much better. The waiter (Manuel according to the receipt) actually checked with the kitchen about my allergy and was back to me promptly with the confirmation that they do in fact (rather unusually) make their french onion soup with chicken stock (a bizarre allergy, I know). \\n\\n  My last visit mostly redeemed previous experiences and I'll probably give Mon Ami Gabi another go in the future if for no other reason than the view.\",\n",

The ambiance was really romantic, the service was excellent- our busser Nester was seriously on top of things with drinks, and the food was to die for.

The French Toast was topped with blueberries, blueberry syrup, and fresh whipped cream. It was sooo delicious! The portions were pretty big, so I gave the other piece to my husband. He agreed that I ordered the better dish. He was trying to be all healthy and what not by getting the Turkey & Egg White Omelette. Lesson learned. The bacon was good, but could have been a little crispier in IMO.\\n\\nThe service was great. We were in and out within an hour. I just found out there is a Mon Ami Gabi in the DC area, so I will definitely be checking it out!\",\n",
       " 'Sit on the patio if you can! We sat half in and half out on the patio where it was nicely air conditioned. The food was great and our server was wonderful. We ordered everything he suggested and he was very spot on! We only came for brunch so I cant vouch for dinner.',\n",

       " 'Awsome view of Bellagio water fountain, very kind hosts\\nSteak is very bad. Scallope is good.',\n",
       " \"We ordered small portion of food for the table to start with and asked our server, Stephanie, to come and check back with us in 5 minutes after all our food was served. She never came back to ask how the food was, nor she ever filled our drinks. I tried to grab her attention to order extra food as the portion was too small for my family but she never looked at our table nor paid any attention. The food itself was great, but our night was ruined by her service. As I couldn't get her attention to order more food, we just finished with what we had and waited for about 10 minutes just for the check. I even had to ask for our check from another server by stopping him and ask for a check. He had to let Stephanie know that we want check and she just simply dropped her check off to our table without saying anything. At the end, I had to leave no tip and informed her of her poor service. I will never go back to this place and I wouldn't recommend any of my friends to this place.\",\n",
       " 'Place was phenomenal ate there with my friends on vacation and we wanted to have one fancy meal together. Coming from New York i expected a nice french restaurant like this to break the bank however it was actually very reasonably priced. Food was amazing the waiter brought us some delicious wine that he recommend the steak and frites were perfect. Furthermore, the place gave a wonderful baguette to start which was very typical french and the escargot and onion soup were all amazing. I will definitely return to this place on my next trip to vegas.',\n",
       " 'I was in Vegas on a work trip and stopped in for dinner with a co-worker.  Great menu selection, we enjoyed everything we ordered and a really diverse wine list.  It was freezing when I was there so we sat in the interior patio with a great view of the Bellagio fountains.',\n",

       " 'This is a nice-casual place for breakfast or lunch with a great view of the Belagio & fountain across the street. Had eggs Benedict for breakfast & it was tasty. Not exceptional, but enjoyable. They also offered a gluten free eggs Benedict option which was nice. Service was good but not great. Good coffee!',\n",
       " 'Had never been here before Sunday night.  Right across from the Bellagio, you can sit inside or out on the patio and see the water show. I was with the guys, but seemed like a nice place inside for a romantic interlude.. darkly lit, with old world decorations and high ceilings.. believe there was a fireplace as well.. you get the picture.  We had a 40 minute wait for the patio.  Food was xlnt.    For cocktails the waitress recommended a French Martini, sounded good, tasted fantastic, but failed to check on cost and it was $12.95 for one drink!  OK it was super fantastic, (gee I need to make more money).. Shared a baked cheese appetizer, table loved it, I had the scallops with a pureed mushroom sauce, best scallops I had ever eaten. Think they were $23.. Lovely.. would not hesitate to return ..this is a steak house, but no one tried a steak, one guy dieting had soup, another had the fish and chips which was a flat fillet rather than the breaded chunky pieces you usually see.  Everything was excellent, bill was $180 for 3, which included 3 cocktails and 2 glasses of wine and a shared dessert.',\n",
       " \"I had higher expectation for this place, but was sadly disappointed. I've had better filet mignon, fries, and duck. The merlot butter left a dry aftertaste in my mouth that was not enjoyable. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare so they get kudos for that. The duck my husband ordered was dry. The ambiance was romantic, but very crowded. The service was good. \\n\\nOverall, I don't think we'll be coming back to this place. If you still want to try this place out, I would recommend that you make reservation online because there is always a wait. You can even request where you want to sit (i.e. indoor, outdoor, window, etc.) and the front desk will try to accomodate you the best they can.\",\n",
       " \"Happy Birthday to my best friend!! We made reservations for 8 people and they seated us in a greenhouse area, which has amazing lightning and a great view of the Bellagio fountains. \\n\\nThey start us off with giant loaves of bread and butter. The bread was so addicting and so delicious; I probably ate through one whole loaf myself. We all started off with the CHARCUTERIE & CHEESE PLATTER. It says it serves 2 or more, but we shared it among the 8 of us and there were leftovers! The platter is set, so there's no options to choose your cheese or meat. The cheese were pretty basic - blue, brie, and goat cheese, I expected more. The unique thing was that the platter came with 3 different pates, all pretty good. For entrees, I shared the BEARNAISE STEAK FRITES. The steak was cooked well and the bearnaise sauce reminded me of a hollandaise sauce. Plus, the frites were like thin In-N-Out fries! The CASARECCIA PASTA was very light in flavor, but I did like the choice of pasta! Between the SALMON and the TROUT ALMONDINE, the salmon was definitely better. The trout was a little too salty, while the salmon was cooked and seasoned perfectly. \\n\\nThe restaurant is very beautiful, service is pretty good, and they offer free dessert for your birthday! They're known for their steak frites, and that's what I would put my money on! I definitely need to come back for brunch though because I heard that's where it's at!\",\n",
       " \"I had to write a review just to say their smoked salmon is to die for! A must try!! Food was delicious, we had an order of their oysters, smoked salmon, corned beef hash w/poached eggs and the steak bordelaise (bomb!), Only problem was that the service fell a little short (I'm guessing because it's LDW) but overall a great place.\",\n",
       " 'Pretty good ambiance. Wait time was only ten minutes to get patio seating. You can people watch and see the bellagio fountain show. The food was decent. Got the caramelized onion steak but it was pretty thin cut. The flavor was a little lacking but I liked the tenderness.',\n",
       " \"Just returned here after a business trip. Stayed at Paris so had no reason not to go here due to it's convenience. Well, we wound up eating here three times because it was so good. I have been here before and didn't remember it to be as delicious, but we had breakfast here twice and lunch once. My husband (this totally shocked me) thought the service and ambience was better than at Del Friscos. Cudos to Nicole and Peter, our servers who were great. It is lovely to eat outside and people watch.\",\n",
       " \"A favorite late lunch spot! Views of the bellagio water feature. (It doesn't start spouting until 3, so plan accordingly!)\\nCrepes, seafood, salads, sandwiches-- I've literally had it all over the years. I always look forward to spending an afternoon here. \\nService is always good, in spite of the fact that the place is always packed! \\nI love the wine/champagne cart! \\nGo have a long leisurely late lunch, complete with fun drinks and water feature views, of course follow that up with a nice nap!\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I enjoyed dinner here on Sunday evening. The atmosphere is classic French with an indoor/outdoor feel. The meal started with a warm baguette and soft butter. Then I had a warm goat cheese salad with sun dried tomatoes. The goat cheese was some of the best I've ever had - perfectly creamy and tangy!\\nMy husband had the beef wellington served in a delicious buttery pastry with garlic spinach on the side.\\nFor dessert we shared profiteroles filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with warm hot fudge. It was a wonderful indulgence!\\nI highly recommend coming here for a reasonably priced, romantic meal.\",\n",
       " \"We made breakfast reservations and were seated inside.  I'm unsure of what it would take to get a coveted patio seat.  I was very happy with our table, as it was away from the crowd and it was a windy day.  \\n\\nThe menu is full of Parisian breakfast fare, and it was difficult to decide what to get.  Upon the recommendation from our waitress we ordered the banana, Nutella, and hazelnut crepes to share with the table.  They were phenomenal and perfectly done.  My standard eggs Benedict was savory and delicious.  The coffee was abundant and rich.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and not much was said once we got the food, which is a sign of a great meal.  I will definitely come back again.\",\n",
       " \"I've eaten here twice and both times were good. Not fantastic though, which makes me think I need to return for the steak frites! The patio is definitely one of the best on the strip. It has some shaded areas but can still get extremely hot.. my butter melted completely just from sitting in the sun! Great people watching.. it's too bad you can't request to be seated there when you make a reservation. I think my favorite item that I've tried is the chicken crepe. The bread and butter is very good.. the little bag makes it feel like a true french baguette!\",\n",
       " 'Everyone in my party got a steak, but with different sauces. They were all ok. Steak is thin but tender. The bordelaise sauce was a bit too sweet. The frites were delicious, like extra fried in n out fries. We also shared mussels and they were pretty good.\\n\\nAlthough not bad, not really 4 star worthy on yelp, especially given the price. Nothing extremely memorable about the food. Would have been nice to sit outside. Service was great though.',\n",
       " 'Delicious!  Great service. Sat on the patio facing strip as we and shared steak fritte, eggs Benedict and oysters.  Everything was well well seasoned and delicious including the French loaf that comes with your meal.  Will be a must anytime U go to Vegas',\n",
       " \"I am normally averse to eateries on the Strip because I am of the opinion that they tend to be more bark than bite, and prices tend to be inflated too. But after a long day of hiking, we wanted something close by, which is to say we were hungry, it was late, and options were becoming limited. So we settled on Mon Ami Gabi. I've stayed at the Paris before, and walked by this place many times, but it never really caught my eye. I'm glad it did this time.\\n\\nWe got here at 9:15 pm, with a reservation, but still had to wait 10 minutes or so, which wasn't terrible. The place looks like a French cafe, with incredibly tightly packed tables. There is a constant din from the other diners, and this being Vegas, the din is alcohol and tourist fueled. There was a table nearby of retirees singing Do You Know the Way to San Jose and another large table where some jackass kept dropping F bombs until he had food in his mouth. I kid you not. Ask for a seat on the patio, where you'll have a front row view of the Bellagio fountain. \\n\\nAs soon as you're seated, a baguette with whipped butter appears PDQ, but because it was so busy, the rest of the service tended to be a bit slow. Don't let that discourage you from coming here though! \\n\\nFor appetizers, we had the jumbo lump crab cake and mussels mariniere. The crab cake was literally just one little crab cake, served with a celery salad and a sauce gribiche, which is like an aioli. The gribiche was delicious, and the crab cake was decent, but was obviously overmixed. The lump crab was unmercifully beaten into shreds. The mussels however, were fantastic! They were huge, plump, and juicy, served in a delicious white wine and butter herb sauce. They must have been Mediterranean mussels, since blue mussels don't get this big. \\n\\nWe also tried the seared salmon and steak roquefort. The salmon was cooked to perfection, flaky, but still moist. I was impressed with their technique, though I am pretty sure it was farmed Atlantic salmon, as the flavor was tame. But still, it was a good piece of fish. \\n\\nBut this place is known for its steak frites, so I had to have a steak, and I chose the steak roquefort. All of the steak frites, save for those steaks specifically identified as another cut, are top sirloin, which for my money is among the beefier cuts of meat. Top sirloin is sometimes a bit tough, though not here. My steak was pounded so thin it only had one side to it! But it was amazingly moist and tender (ordered medium rare), and the roquefort sauce was packed with flavor. Each bite just melted in my mouth!\\n\\nWe finished our meal with a warm flourless chocolate cake, which was also delicious. Deeply chocolatey and moist, but light and fluffy, which is unusual for a cake of this type. It was served with a dollop of whipped cream and some berries, which provided a nice counterpoint to the chocolate.\\n\\nAll in all, this was one of the best meals I had in a while, and Mon Ami Gabi will become one of my regular haunts in Vegas.\",\n",
       " 'Beautiful patio views of the Bellagio fountains..both daytime and nighttime. \\nGreat breakfast place! Egg white turkey omelet is a good healthy choice. I give this place !',\n",
       " \"As expected was very busy as most places in Vegas are. Came with a party of 7 and had a reservation; wait staff handled it well.\\n\\nGood location on the strip; I would sit outside or on the patio if possible.\\n\\nI tried the onion soup, steak bordelaise and the salmon.\\n\\nFirst thing I noticed was water stains on the steak knife, after conferring with my party turns out one side of the knife always has water marks.\\n\\nThe onion soup itself was a bit runny with a heavy hand on the cheese; the bread in the soup seemed to be in there for days. The steak bordelaise was a bit bland and the cut a bit thin for my taste; the steak merlot on the other hand seemed overly sweet. The fries that came with the steak were oddly not bad. The salmon was pretty bland as well; nothing too special, not terrible either; typical flavoring of pepper salt and lemon.\\n\\nFor the price it's a nice ambience in Vegas, but in terms of the food, there are many other options available.\",\n",
       " \"I have eaten here few times while visiting Las Vegas. I have had breakfast and dinner. The food has always been always great, except coffee which has been below average. However, I am giving only 3 stars because of service. When you are by yourself and not ordering alcohol, the serves profile you. They know you won't spend tons of money, so they don't give you as much attention.\",\n",
       " \"This food was great and so was the view. The only reason why I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars is because of the service... Our server seemed bothered that she had to wait on us and was flat out rude the whole time.\",\n",
       " 'To me, service is always as important as quality of dishes. We had a hard time bringing the server to our table throughout the dinner. The only time she came to our table without us calling her was when she was collecting the payment. The server wasn\\'t able to give us a recommendation on wines. She seemed like she had absolutely no knowledge on wines and when asked for a recommendation, she told us to look at the wine list and pick any because all the wines listed were \"good\" to her. We ordered scallops and steak frites. Scallops were heavenly but the steak was just okay. If I go back to this restaurant, it would be because of their scallops. We got a table for 2 by the wall and it was too tiny to fit two dishes, wines, and waters. I almost burned myself, trying to get water, with the candles that they put on the table. This restaurant was too pricey for the service and the portion of the food that we got. Tip: If possible, make a reservation beforehand. We had a reservation and got there a little early for dinner so there was no wait but when we left, there was a long line outside.',\n",
       " \"I had lunch here one time and was disappointed.  I had the steak sandwich with fries.  the sandwich wasn't filling and didn't taste as good as i hoped. All the fries were small, burnt and crunchy, like the ones u get at the bottom of a McDonald's bag.  and when i asked for ranch the server looked at me like i was crazy and said they don't serve ranch.  I'm sure they have better food and maybe one day I'll go back and find out.\",\n",

       " 'Mon Ami Gabi was great for dinner.  Our party of three each enjoyed our meals.  The service was fast and friendly and offered great suggestions when asked.  For a great location on the strip, their prices were beyond reasonable.  Will definitely go again when the opportunity arises.',\n",
       " 'Love, love, love Mon Ami Gabi. Killer style and decor, excellent location and views. And most of all, the food. Always very good and never fails to surprise in a good way. This time we had the fish of the day, Atlantic char. Light, flavorful, balanced nicely with spinach and potatoes.  Scallop appetizer was delicious, could have had more scallops. Steak bordelaise got rave reviews. A little too much salt on the chicken paillard.  Washed it down with champagne chilled exactly right. Gabi just puts me and friends in a happy, contented state for hours. What more can you ask?',\n",
       " \"Let me first start off by saying, Mon Ami Gabi does not understand the point of reservations. If you make a reservation, you still have to wait in line with people who do not have reservations. So don't plan on just being able to walk up and check in. Generally, the food was good. Nothing notable about it, but good none the less. It's a reasonably priced, reasonable quality dinner place on the strip. If you're looking for dinner on the strip and don't want to pay hundreds of dollars, I would recommend Mon Ami Gabi.\",\n",
       " \"Food was pretty good,  and you can't beat the view. Disappointed in the number of options,  but glad to see they have a gluten free menu.\",\n",
       " \"Mon Ami Gabi is a solid choice, if not the best choice for dining on the strip. And by on the strip, I mean RIGHT on the strip. Try to get an outside seat (first come first serve) or be nice to the maître d' to get seating by the windows. You'll get a fantastic view of the Bellagio and its fountains.\\n\\nI recommend the Trout Amandine and the Chocolate Mousse. The Duck Confit was generous in size and quite tender but saltier than most. For brunch, get a cappuccino in a bowl and enjoy the eggs Benedict or one of the crêpes.\\n\\nI've been to Mon Ami Gabi several times: an early dinner, a late dinner, and brunch. The first and last example had great service. In the late dinner, there were lots of diners and the service was a weak for a while, but recovered in time for dessert. Prices are, well, to be expected for this prime real estate on the Strip. Trust me, you can do worse. Make a reservation, as they are easy to get sometimes even hours in advance but seats will take a while to get late at night.\",\n",
       " \"Read good reviews for Mon Ami - inexpensive (for Vegas), good food, etc. - and it totally lived up to it's expectations! \\n\\nGreat seating area outside with a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains. Loved this! The space heaters are clutch, too.\\n\\nWe ordered the baked cheese in tomato sauce and wolfed it down. I'm pretty sure we went through 3 baguettes just eating this! The main meals we ordered (chicken and brie sandwich and ham and cheese crepe) were just fine, but the baked cheese stole the show.\\n\\nTried gluten free beer too - not bad at all! My only complaint is that the service was a bit slow. Everything else was a great experience. DEFINITELY order the baked cheese!!\",\n",
       " \"I was really looking forward to eating here after coming to Vegas so many times and never having tried. We went for breakfast and I figured a french bistro, I couldn't go wrong with eggs Benedict right? WRONG!\\n\\nI don't know if the bread used was frozen and then thawed or if it was sitting out all night but it was so hard I couldn't cut it to save my life! I even asked for a steak knife and that could not cut this rock-hard brick of bread. \\n\\nWhat made it worse, was our server could care less about our table. She was too busy working on the larger group tables to even notice we had a problem. She never came back once to ask how the meal was going. \\n\\nPaid the bill and left very disappointed.\",\n",
       " \"There was a Mon Ami Gabi around my area in DC, and though I was curious, the menu was never enticing enough.  I eventually moved away without having ever tried it.  I noticed that MAG Las Vegas had a lot of good reviews, so last night we finally dined here.  Wow, I've been srsly missing out.\\n\\nThe menu was basically steak and then everything else.  Unfortunately, we had been grazing all day, so we were not able to order all we wanted.  What we did get:\\n\\nMussels- The full order was a little less than $30, and for an appetizer, it was more than enough for the two of us.  To me, the sauce was a little under-salted, but otherwise, very good.  I believe it had some sherry cream base and generous slices of garlic.  It paired really well with our first baguette, which was quite hard.  9/10\\n\\nBurrata- This is an un-matured cheese...basically, you make a pouch in a mozzarella ball and fill it with curd and cream.  I thought the brininess of the olive tapenade countered the fresh, but otherwise almost neutral  taste of the cheese well.  I asked for more baguette to eat with this, since the three toast points this came with was not enough.  The second baguette was very soft, and I could not get enough of this and the burrata.  I'm very much a fat and carb addict, so I could've eaten this for my entree; it was so good!  My only issue was that at almost $15, this dish was a little over-priced.  9/10\\n\\nSkate- We chose this as our entree, b/c this is one item that I won't be making at home anytime soon.  In fact, I think the last time we had this was in Kuala Lumpur ages ago.  I just don't see this on the menu in the States much.  And boy, am I glad we ordered it.  The skate was completely deboned and cooked to perfection.  My husband inhaled it so quickly.  He didn't like the fennel salad that came with this.  I could understand b/c the anise flavor of the fennel didn't pair well with skate.  Maybe something more vinegary/tart would've been better.  Licorice and fish just doesn't mesh perfectly.  And the skate could've been seasoned just a touch more.  But this is splitting hairs, b/c the dish was quite stellar.  9/10\\n\\nI don't usually care much about restaurant ambience/location, but here, it is key.  We somehow got seated front and center to an incredible view of the Bellagio fountains.  It was mind-blowingly incredible!  I think we had the best seat in the house.  We were barely placed inside, at the midpoint of the patio.  If we had been placed on the patio, we would've been to close to the traffic or too exposed.  There was a lamp blocking our otherwise perfect view, but we really didn't think too much about it.  \\n\\nService was perfunctory, and I can't complain.  I would be very interested to return and try the steak (just need to come hungry enough).  I'm curious about the chicken, too.  Ina Garten makes such a big deal about french chicken that I'm curious what that is about.  Maybe the trout almondine too since I've never ordered it.  Did I mention the onion soup.  Gah, I'm such a little pig!\",\n",
       " \"I've been coming here for breakfast every time I am in Vegas. The food is delicious but the coffee is magical. It's smooth and rich, and as is the case in a few, rare places doesn't require sugar.\\n\\nThe selection of Benedicts is fantastic, the croissant sandwich is to die for and the egg white omelets taste amazing.\\n\\nThe staff is attentive and friendly, the service is excellent and the decor is authentic and quite lovely.\",\n",

Maybe we just didn't order the right things, but my bf and I weren't that impressed.\\n\\nWe came for brunch and ordered the Quiche Lorraine and the Corned Beef Hash. The quiche was cooked well, but it was too much of one thing and I couldn't finish it. I was expecting several small pieces of crispy bacon, but ended up with some big chunks of fat. I didn't try the corned beef hash, but my bf said it didn't taste the way he expected.\\n\\nService was okay. Our waiter didn't check on us quite enough, but did his job. I expected a nicer atmosphere, but for some reason it didn't seem that nice. The place seemed too cramped and busy.

I must say, I was quite blown away, considering that I don't particularly like duck. The config was juicy, moist and fatty, and the duck was not gamey at all.

       " \"I really wanted to like this place. It all started out very well, made a res, was seated almost immediately on a busy night and even landed an outside table which was awesome. Great people watching! This is where the experience stops. You could tell the waiter didn't really want to be there. I dont blame him....but all in all his was really professional. Space was extremely tight, my aunt had to keep moving her chair so people could get by so that was annoying. Now the food, most importantly...we had the oyster, great selection horrifyingly overpriced. Steaks were 'meh'. They were good but no where near the price we paid good. Now i understand this is vegas and everything is up charged outrageously but i guess i expected a little more.\",\n",
       " \"I went here with family . This is a average strip restaurant. This place isn't great its just alright . I've been here for breakfast and dinner service both just okay. For out of towners this would seem awesome but to a Vegas local I've  had much better off the strip.\",\n",

       " \"Went here for a late dinner (around 10:30pm) on a Friday night. We had wanted to check out the Paris hotel and get a bit to eat and Mon Ami Gabi was one of the only restaurants still open in the hotel. It did take us quite a while to decide what we wanted seeing as the menu is mostly steak and neither me or the bf are quite fond of it. I settled on the lemon chicken, with hesitation because it didn't seem very French but was one of the only things that appealed to me. The bf had the salmon and both turned out to be very good. The mini baguette and butter was also quite tasty and the restaurant is very cute inside. My favorite part of the meal, however, was the sparkling rose', of which I had two glasses.\\n\\nI would recomment Mon Ami Gabi if you are a fan of steak and don't mind paying $30 for it.\",\n",
       " 'Mon Ami Gabi is a classic French Bistro done right.  The ambiance reminds you of a Parisian Bistro right down to the tile on the floors to the white table cloths and servers.  It is not at all pretentious.  The food is excellent, if not a little rich.   Try the Nicoise Salad.  The Gintoneria drink is off the chain!',\n",
       " 'A really nice, relaxed setting, especially if you sit outside. We got there too early on a Sunday morning for the Bellagio fountains to be on, which was a shame, but it was still a pleasant place to be. Service was friendly and prompt. The food, overall, was very good. My 5 year old son got a yogurt parfait with cherry compote, which was perhaps too small for adult appetites, but suited him perfectly. My wife enjoyed her breakfast -- I forgot what it was, maybe Eggs Florentine. I was a little disappointed in what I ordered, which was the Egg White Omelette. It was a serious pile of egg whites, with a drizzle of \"sauce vert\" - a green sauce - on the top. Egg white overload. Really my fault, though, because the dish was as described and I should have made a better choice.\\n\\nWhen in Vegas, I\\'d definitely return to Mon Ami Gabi.',\n",

       " 'Every month, our team at work plans a team building event for us to get to know one another outside of the office. For the month of March, we wanted to do it big.  We wanted to experience something out of the norm, somewhere that required a dress up opportunity. There were a few options, however, we all ended up deciding on Mon Ami Gabi for our \"Fancy Dinner\" event. Boy were we excited!\\n\\nWhen you enter the restaurant, you immediately hit the bar area. Along with the hostess stand, you see a bunch of high top tables and bar seating. The place just exudes a romantic vibe! It\\'s located directly under the Vegas version Eiffel Tower and along the strip sidewalk. The lights in the location are dim and intimate, the white table clothes bring the upscale element. Wine glasses on the table sparkled brightly. Man, we were excited! Our table top was on the south end of the restaurant and the corner windows viewed the sidewalk veranda and the tower base. Our server, although I can\\'t remember her name, was super sweet! She was personable and offered some really great appetizers and drinks. What I really liked about her was her efficiency! We had a 13 person party and she was still on it! Our food came out hot and ready in record time! For our apps, drinks and meals, here\\'s what we had:\\n\\nChateau Laronde Desormes Bordeaux for $54 a bottle - This wine was on point! It was soft with a sweet finish. Definitely an everyday kind of Bordeaux, something you can drink all the time. This wine went great with my meal!\\n\\nWarm Brie Cheese for $12.95 - Served with black pepper honey, garlic, hazelnuts, croutons and greens. I love brie. This combination was no different. Whole cloves of roasted garlic enhanced the flavor of the cheese very well. \\n\\nChicken Liver Mousse Pate for $11.95 - First time trying this.  THE BEST THING I HAD THAT NIGHT! Served with burgundy red wine mustard and toast brioche with a garnish of gherkins and olives. The burgundy mustard brought a spicy/tangy element and the mouse was so rich and divine. This is MUST TRY, so delicious!\\n\\nBaked Goat Cheese for $11.95 - Another great dish. Tomato sauce surrounded the cheese with herb garlic bread. The cheese was super creamy and went well with the tomato profile. \\n\\nSeafood Platter for $49.95 - What a platter! Stuffed with shrimp, oysters and lobsters, this dish offered a little bit of everything for everyone! There were various dipping sauces and it was all served over ice. \\n\\nBone in Ribeye for $39.95 - This was my actual dinner. 22oz cut of steak, PERFECTLY cooked to my temperature, served with a bearnaise sauce and their signature hand cut fries. The steak was delicious. The right amount of marbleized meat, perfectly seasoned and packed with flavor and juices. AH-MAZE-ING. The bearnaise sauce was definitely not needed but offered another element. The fries were flat and super crispy. Really helped to break up the meat with a crunchy aspect. \\n\\nWhat a meal! This place has got to be one of the best upscale restaurants I\\'ve tried here in Vegas. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an amazing date night restaurant, team building dinner joint or event a place that serves THE BEST pate! I will for sure be back, time and time again.  Thank you so much, Mon Ami Gabi, for making this evening one that I\\'ll never forget!',\n",

       " \"(edited on 11/17/12)\\n\\nI have been there about 7 times. I like to sit outside - to watch Bellagio fountain show. \\n\\nFood quality wise, you can't compare to Robuchon or Bouchon - Mon Ami Gabi is a French version of Denny's. That's for sure. Or maybe worse... \\n\\nI've had Ground Ahi Tuna Burger and Bacon Cheese Burger - nothing special, nothing better than burgers at Hard Rock Cafe.\\n\\nI've had seafood crepe - it is OK. Seafood is not fresh. Could be using frozen seafood.\\n\\nGratin - greasy - heavy - rich - if you like to gain fat, this should be fine. I am worried if someone get heart attack. \\n\\nTrout - i remembered it was no good. \\n\\nFish and Chips - very thin sliced fish make it pretty greasy. Kinda same as one at Todd English at Aria. (it was my fault to get fish&chips at French bistro, yo know)\\n\\n(newly edited) \\n\\nI USED to like all their mousse and pate - along with oysters to pair with wine - with a great fountain view. However, I went back and it was a huge disappointment.\\n\\nJumbo Shrimp Cocktail - when the server put the dish on our table, something was wrong - shrimps looked kinda brown - we thought it was some sort of spices,,, then as soon as we ate it, we realized that it was an unfresh, oxidized shrimp! It tasted like dirt. Horrible! I'm sure they use the same old shrimps for other dishes. Gross!\\n\\nLiver Mousse and Pate - I guess no one orders these items here - I could tell because all the edges were all dried out - pretty disgusting. \\n\\nEndive salad - It is not a great experience to have green leaves turn brown and wilt. \\n\\nMussels - bad,,,,, They didn't break my expectation. NOT FRESH! At this point, I was concerned about food poisoning. So, I asked to get a check. It was enough...\\n\\nWhen the food, especially seafood, gets old, they should throw them away - because you know, there is a risk of spreading food poisoning! Don't give me these stained shrimps, dude.\\n\\nBtw, frites are better than Lay's potato chips. Complimentary Baguette is pretty terrible. You can get better baguettes cheaper at Albertson's.\\n\\nMy suggestion - never get seafood here if you know what decent seafood tastes like. Just get burgers - cheap and simple. I guess those people who are giving 5 stars just eat burgers and steaks, not seafood. \\n\\nService - not that great - too busy all the time - my server wasn't nice at all - she didn't stop at our table. No refills. I saw she was chatting for a while at another table, tho. \\n\\nYou will see all the men in black here - they indeed look professional in a funny way - but imagine if they change it to Denny's uniforms - surly enough, they would fit really well.\\n\\nAlso, when I made a reservation today (Sat. Nov 10 2012 around lunch time), the hostess was really rude over the phone.  This is Karma on Yelp, haha.\\n\\nI have been going there to see Bellagio, not to enjoy food and service, but it was way too terrible.... I will never go back again.\\n\\n1 star is for Bellagio's fountain show.\",\n",

I am not really a big fan of dining on the strip, but if you have to do it, why not do it outside while enjoying a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and the freaks that come out at night in Las Vegas?\\n\\nWe had the seafood appetizer (whole lobster, oysters, shrimp, tuna tartare, seaweed salad.)  The only thing on this appetizer that wasn't amazing was the seaweed salad.  Worth the $24.95 a person price tag.  Also had the Steak Roquefort served with these crispy potatoes.  Very flavorful, but you better love Roquefort cheese or this dish is not for you.  \\n\\nHonestly, the food is beside the point at Mon Ami Gabi.  You'll be too busy staring at the fountains and everyone who walks by.  Fortunately, the food is actually very good.  And you can't find a more romantic spot if you try.\",\n",

I've been to Paris several times, and this place actually had some charm and flavors reminiscent of my favorite place on Earth. The decor was lovely with art nouveau touches and bistro style furnishings. They give you fresh baguettes in paper bags like they do in pastisseries...cute. The service was excellent, the garcons dressed for the part. My husband had the bone in rib eye which he pronounced extremely delicious. We also had escargot and it was as good as any I had in France. It's a nice plus that the dining room is across the street from the Bellagio water fountain and show, which you can get a nice view of if seated near the windows.\",\n",

The sides of green beans and asparagus are delicious (though anything with that much butter is.)\\n$8 for a wonderful glass of Pinot Noir? Wow. \\nEveryone at our table ordered something different. From the moist chicken dishes to the hearty steaks we were all happy.\\nIf they have the Bread Pudding dessert with caramel topping & vanilla bean ice cream (not on the menu. It was a special for the night) you need to get it. It was rich and sweet and definitely large enough for 2-3 people (we were a party of 5 and were satisfied!)\\n\\nService:\\nThe hostess was rude. She was a 21 year old girl that held up her finger, didn\\'t make eye contact and said \"one sec\" after my boyfriend said \"hello we have a reservation for 5 at 7pm\". I don\\'t care if you\\'re listening to some critical information in that ear piece of yours about table availability. Learn to multi task. Provide decent service to the PEOPLE in front of you. Smile. Give a little head nod. Something..   \\nLuckily we didn\\'t end with service like that. The girl who escorted us to our table was very considerate in moving us to a \"better\" one away from the doors when we requested it. Our waitress was fantastic (she took my steak back b/c it was medium rare and made it medium well for me and she recommended an amazing dessert). \\n\\nOverall:\\nVery reasonably priced dinner and wines. I don\\'t know if I\\'d come back (too many great places to try in Vegas) but I\\'d definitely recommend everyone try it once, especially if you\\'re looking for a more budget friendly restaurant (vs. Mario Batali\\'s or Hubert Keller\\'s).

The food was seriously plentiful and delicious.  I will never forget the escargot - it was simply to die for.\\n\\nOur most recent visit was last month.  Yes, our table was not in the ideal location (in the bar area) and we were seated next to a table of ignorant early 20's, probably having a first meal in a French restaurant (one guy told our waiter the French onion soup wasn't what he expected.

Because they do it real and delicious here.)\\n\\nMust haves: Baked cheese...downside - they don't give you nearly enough bread; scallop entree - you get FIVE large sea scallops (which is 2 more than most other places) which were perfectly seasoned and cooked and of course, their steak....I asked for the bearnaise sauce with my ribeye but in the end, hardly used any of it.  My steak was perfectly cooked and the leftover half of it tasted just as good (though a bit cooler) later that night.\\n\\nService was...interesting.  Very attentive but maybe a little smarmy.  Our waiter was French.  How original...a French server (with a French name) in a French restaurant.  Our table took bets on whether his accent was real or not.  Surprisingly, everyone thought it was fake!  None of us had the balls to really ask but it was entertaining and quite fun. He was a very nice gentleman and I would love to have him serve us again though I can't remember his name...Claude??\\n\\nMon Ami Gabi was our first love in Las Vegas and it will always remain dear in our hearts.\",\n",

He said sitting in a four table by myself would be odd and that it is the \"busiest restaurant in America.\" .....possibly a slight exaggeration, because by the time I left about an hour later there were only about six other parties at most. I probably should have left then and there as soon as he said that, but I didn\\'t really have a choice as this was the only place open and I was supposed to meet someone there. \\nI am sure this place gets busy as hell and I am sure it is an extra chore to clear and reset places and yada yada and I am sure that a 20 dollar check does not ensure dancing acrobats, but I am paying for a decent time, service and meal just like anyone else and there was NO ONE else there. \\nBad form! Rude comment! Distasteful! This place has an overinflated opinion of itself, really I had an omelette and a cappacino and it was tiny and the hashbrowns were burnt. I think I made something similar to the omelette once with my leftovers. Horrendous! This was the first time in a long long long time that I truly did not want to pay for this meal, and I am never one of those......\\nTo be fair, if I came here on a different day with some friends it probably would have been different, and there is a terrific view of the Bellagio of course, and maybe the food would have been fine and with a large crowd the ambiance would have been pleasant so perhaps this overall four star rating is accurate, but I only have my own experience.  \\nAlso, I could tell the hostesses did not care for my attire or my suitcases and I got several dirty looks from a lot of the staff on the way out. Get over yourself! It was freaking 7:00 in the morning. It\\'s freaking Vegas, people are coming and going and traveling for long hours and may or may not have been up for several days.

We loved how they included real horse radish and a brine to sprinkle over the oysters, which made them top notch in our book! \\n\\nThe French onion soup was very rich and heavy.  That and a loaf of baguette bread, and you have yourself a complete meal. We especially like dipping a piece of bread in their creamy, awesome whipped butter, and then dipping it in the soup and melding all those flavors together - yummm!!   The soup was very good. We were a little surprised they used gruyere cheese (we think) since we are used to Swiss being in top.  \\n\\nThe salmon was good perfectly and tasted really good!  I highly recommend salmon and the salad it came with if you want something healthy but robust.  Also the lemon vinaigrette dressing was great for a warm spring or summer day. \\n\\nThe seafood crepe was our favorite though!!  At first I thought the peas in the crepe were strange, until I tasted it.  The peas give the cream sauce and the crepe an extra edge and natural creamy sweetness!  The scallops and shrimp were perfect grilled and cooked too. We loved that dish! :)\\n\\nAnd last but not least, we ordered the Banana's Foster bread pudding with ice cream dessert. The brioche bread was cooked just right and the foster's sauce was almost like maple syrup. Very tasty.

I\\'ve been eating here for special occasions for at least 14 years or so.\\n\\nThat being said, I found last night\\'s dinner to only be OK. My group started with the French Onion Soup, the gazpacho special, and the Baked Goat Cheese Salad. The gazpacho was great! The soup was a touch too sweet and the salad, frankly, was not worth it. One circle of cheese on top of greens. For $14.\\n\\nI found my steak to be good, but not great. In my mind the steaks have always been great so I\\'m not sure what happened. The fries, very sadly, were a touch over cooked. \\n\\nOur dessert was the caramel creme brulee and it was divine! Excellent! Our server was also very friendly.\\n\\nAll of this being said, \"OK\" at Mon Ami Gabi is \"great\" anywhere else. I just have so many perfect meals in my memory that last night\\'s meal didn\\'t quite match up.',\n",

Initially my wife thought it would be too hot to watch the Bellagio fountains since it was still 98 degrees at our 8:15 PM RSVP however the air conditioning coming from the restaurant kept us very comfortable. I would highly recommend a table in the patio vs being inside. \\n\\nFirst of all the food and device was amazing!  We thought it was better than Gordon Ramsay's Steak Restaurant which we had dinner on Friday night.  We started off with a dirty martini for me and a French martini for my wife. Both came out cold and spot on. The escargot, the goose liver pate and the French onion soup ordered for appetizers was fantastic. Our kids ordered from the kids menu and had the steak. They devoured it.  I ordered the ribeye steak and shared with my wife. Glad we shared because it was a big steak!  \\n\\nFor the surprise of the evening...we got to see the fireworks celebrating Caesars Palace. It was spectacular to see the fireworks and then also see the Bellagio fountains at the same time.  What an awesome way to finish our last night in Las Vegas!\",\n",

The bread was perfectly toasted and buttered.  The lettuce, tomatoes and avocado was so fresh and crisp and such a nice light meal in the Vegas heat. \\n\\nBut i must share with you that although my meal was light and perfect for a lunch the bf ordered their mussel in cream sauce and OMG i almost had foodgasm. The flavor of the cream sauce was so rich but it did not overpower the taste of the mussel, and the mussel was sweet and tender, not rubbery or stiff.  \\n\\nI am still debating if that was onion in the cream sauce or sauerkraut because the texture and taste was sour but crisp and with onion once its cooked down it does not hold a crisp texture plus it tends to taste sweet not tart.  \\n\\nAnywho i cannot wait to visit this eatery again and i shall hunt down a French recipe for mussel in cream sauce.',\n",

I will say the crust on the corned beef and the quality of the meat were top notch.  the eggs were also cooked perfectly. the potato chunks lacked flavor and weren't cooked with the same love as the meat.

The salmon was moist and perfectly cooked, and paired wonderfully with the leek quinoa.\\n\\nDessert is where mon ami gavi shines. \\nThe creme brûlée was creamy and had a good caramelized crust. \\nThe warm chocolate tart with salted caramel ice cream was world changing.

The toast wasn't too great, but the crab salad was delicious. They had some sort of sauce on the side too that was great with the bread and with the little waffle potato chip side.\\n\\nIt was $14.95 for lunch. Not bad for providing me with a Paris ambiance.

The steak roquefort with blue cheese was thin and not the best cut of meats.

In that respect Mon Ami Gabi did not disappoint.\\n\\nWe went early, like 7pm, because we had a show at 9pm at the Rio, a bit far from the Paris. It was hot and sunny, so we requested to be seated inside. We had reservations, and got seated immediately.\\n\\nOur waiter (Stephanie) showed up immediately and instead of starting with the standard script, she made us feel at home, like we just walked into a family owned café in Strasbourg. Really, she was all smiles, friendly and relaxed, no rush. We asked a bunch o questions and she responded perfectly, she never made us feel rushed and no question was too stupid. After her detailed descriptions we knew exactly what we wanted.\\n\\nAt first we got a complimentary baguette with butter to get us going, it was excellent.\\n\\nWe ordered dishes that we normally have a hard time getting in our own side of the planet. The steak au Poivre with Pommes Puree and the Trout Almondine. Both were excellent, highly recommended. How do you say \"Oh là là\" in English?\\n\\nWe also ordered a side of Ratatouille, which we never had before, so I can\\'t tell if it was a \"good ratatouille\", we liked it but nothing special, we probably will not order this again. Yep, the Disney movie was a great influence here (fyi: ours didn\\'t look at all like the one prepared by Remy for the grumpy food critic Anton Ego).\\n\\nTo finish our adventure, we ordered the Chocolate Mousse, also very good. Does life have a meaning without Chocolate Mousse?\\n\\nIn summary, our overall experience at Mon Ami Gabi was excellent, and kudos for Stephanie, she\\'s she type of waiter that I would like to have at all restaurants I go to.

Our party asked for a window seat and although the restaurant was packed, they saved us a nice lil' table with a gorgeous view right next to the window.\\n\\nWe got the chicken liver pate, the country pate and escargot to start. Chicken liver pate was by far our fav. They serve it with this horseradish sauce that just kills it.

Everyone at our table raved about their entrees and had a great time.\\n\\nWe ordered the creme brulee and apple tartin for dessert.

They have a 4 star average, the menu had many options so naturally, we made a reservation for dinner.  \\n\\nWe arrived at 7 but decided to wait an extra 30 mins to get a spot on the patio, that was worth the wait!  The location is in a prime spot, right across from the Bellagio fountains and under the mock Eifel Tour.  After being inside the smoke filled Casino, this fresh air felt really nice.  The patio area, the location and the atmosphere here are definitely deserving of 5 stars.  I however was disappointed with the food, and would only rate that 3 stars.  \\n\\nA lot of the positive reviews that I\\'ve read are for breakfast and the negative ones seem to be for dinner.  I would actually love to have breakfast here, but I probably won\\'t come back for dinner.  There was 3 of us last night and we had a lot of items between us.  The house bread & butter is beyond amazing.  How can a French restaurant not have amazing bread though!  We started with the oysters which were good, along with the mussels which were just average.  My main meal I ordered was strange.  The scallops were good but it was weird having them in a soup type of bean filled dish.  I also like piping hot food and my dish was far from it.  We had ordered some frites (fries) that were really cold, they had obviously just come out from under the heat pan and not out of the fryer.  We actually did ask to have a fresh hot batch of those brought out and they did, yet they were still not hot like I wanted them.  The French onion soup again, was simply luke warm.  I\\'m not one to send food back and if I wouldn\\'t have been with a customer, I would have said something.\\n\\nMy customer ordered the bison steak and said that was okay and his wife had the artichoke.  We loved the cauliflower purée and the spinach was okay.  The mushrooms were strange looking, they looked like shredded pieces of meat.  We didn\\'t have dessert as we had a lot of eat, but we had wine which was good.\\n\\nService was okay, typical Vegas and not what you find in CA.  They were super busy though and we got food and drinks in a decent time.  The prices are very reasonable, especially for Vegas.  The appetizers are priced a bit high, but the main dishes aren\\'t too bad.  The scallops dish was $27, the steaks range from $24 to $42 and the sides are around $5-$7.\\n\\nOverall 5 star atmosphere and patio area, 3 stars for the \"dinner\" food I\\'d give breakfast a shot.',\n",

Heavy and creamy, but the prefect way to start a meal.\\n\\nMussels and frites - I didn't order this, but my friend ordered the large which comes with a huge serving of fries. The mussels looked plump and juicy, and the sauce was to die for. FYI the 20 oz comes with about 8 mussels... so you definitely want to order a full order if you're looking for an entree.\\n\\nDuck confit - appetizer, but definitely entree sized. Kind of dry.

I originally ordered the braised short rib special, offered that night, but I was later told it was sold out which was hugely disappointing, especially considering it was only 7:30pm or so.  Anyway, I went with the Beef Bourgogne since it was listed as a restaurant \"classic\" on the menu, hoping my braised meat craving would be satisfied.  Unfortunately the Beef Bourgogne came to my table looking like hot dog food over egg noodles.  It was just a big plate of mush, really.

Upon checking in, I inquired about patio seating or atrium seating (the section in the middle that can look out to the patio & Bellagio fountain show). I was told there will be a wait. I'm not sure how much of a priority I would have had over those who were already waiting for patio or atrium seating, so I went ahead and took whatever was available and we got seated right away. I ended up getting a table next to the opening leading to the atrium/center seating area, but we still couldn't see anything in regards to the patio or water show.\\n\\nWe got the menus and took about 10-15 minutes to decide. There is a regular lunch menu and a brunch menu, which is limited to 5 items or so. Our group of 4 ordered the sea scallop entree, salmon entree, seafood crepe, full order of mussels & frites, and escargot. While waiting, we had some bread. When the bread is warm, eat it right away! It satisfied our hunger, but was nothing special. It was on the hard side, and the longer we waited to eat it, it became cold and even harder.\\n\\nIt took about 40 minutes to receive our dishes. That was quite long for us since we were hungry. As we got our dishes, we noticed that the crowd died down and a lot of indoor seating was available. I think we could have gotten patio or atrium seating had we come an hour later instead.\\n\\nNow, to the food. The escargot was okay, nothing to write home about. My friends said it was decent, but it was actually bland to me; we've made better at home. The rest of the dishes were good. My sea scallops dish seemed small, but it filled me up. The scallops were cooked to perfection! The accessories on the plate such as slice apples didn't do it for me for the overall dish, so although I enjoyed the scallops, I wouldn't get it again. My friend said the salmon was really good, that the sauce, lentils, and extras contributed to the deliciousness. The seafood crepe, although enjoyable, seemed minimal because there wasn't much inside besides peas. The seafood, which wasn't much, was on the outside of the crepe, along the plate. This was the least filling of all the dishes, but if it were more filling, it would have been perfect. The best item of everything we ordered was probably the mussels & frites. The mussels were abundant, and the soup could be drank or used to dip bread in, and the frites were thin and yummy.\\n\\nThe food was good, but the prices are high. I would only dine here again if I had either atrium or patio seating. Sitting around for 30+ minutes for food got us bored. I wouldn't mind waiting longer if we had something to keep us company, like people watching or the fountain show.\",\n",
       " \"I have no idea how to pronounce the name or what it means, but I'm a fan!  \\n\\nI was in Vegas a few months ago, and was very impressed by the ambiance, cleanliness, food quality and overall service.  We waited at the bar; I was on my kick of Maker's on the rocks with fresh ginger and lime and the bartender totally accommodated my request.  When we moved to the bar to patio seating, the bus boy carried our drinks, and  my ladle of ginger for later!\\n\\nWe sat outside, and our server was kinda a smart ass, which was oddly fun.  We got a variety of dishes; pate, muscles and hanger steak.  Everything was delicious; well seasoned and cooked well.  I think we got dessert, but the night got a little foggy after all that Maker's.\\n\\nOn top of all that, the heat lamps, view of the street and the Belaggio fountains and music going off all night set the mood perfectly.\",\n",

       " \"Went here for brunch on a Sunday morning. We were sat quickly and promptly met by our server who was friendly and knowledgable. \\nI went with the special (eggs Benedict w filet mignon) and my girlfriend went with the quiche. Both we're excellent. \\nEggs Benedict was not smothered in sauce as many places do, the eggs were not over done and the meat was perfect. \\n\\nA little pricey, but considering what we've paid for terrible service and food at other locations (LVH), this place is a bargain.\",\n",
       " 'One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, especially for steak and frites!  \\n\\nSteak cooked perfectly, had both the bone in and filet mignon, the fries are thin and crunchy (how I like it) and appetizers were good too.

       " \"Gabi, you can be mon ami!\\n\\nMy friends dumped the responsibility of picking a dinner place on me (whoo hoo..) - thank you eavesdropping taxi driver for suggesting you, Mon Ami Gabi, at the Paris.  You have steak, seafood, salad, soups.. perfect!\\n\\nAnd, you were a good choice!  Everyone loved their food.  Two of us had the Halibut special, one of us got the Steak Au Poive, another the Steak Bordelaise, one order of the Roast Chicken, and an order of the Thyme-Seared Salmon (which, I would totally recommend, it was delicious!).  I don't think anyone left any food on their plate.  \\n\\nThe only thing I was disappointed with though, is your French Onion soup.  You're a French restaurant.   French Onion soup is, well, French.  Oh, how could you mess that up?  Good thing it was one of the first things I had, so that I could forget about it when I dove into my main entree.\\n\\nOther than that, the view of the Bellagio fountains and your not-so-crazy prices, make you worth eating here.\",\n",
       " \"My review is based on breakfast because I've been here twice, but only for breakfast. Both times we found the food to be very good.  The restaurant gets busy at breakfast, but the food is worth the wait. I had the corned beef hash on my first visit. The corned beef was flavorful and not too salty. They served it with a nice, think toast. I think the quiche I had on my second visit was even better. The quiche is very filling with a nice, rich crust. I'd love to come back and try this restaurant for dinner because I have heard good things.\",\n",
       " 'Delicious. Great selection, and everything was very fresh. Solid cocktail menu with dinner, and the Chicken Grandmere / Sea Scallops we ordered were plenty and very flavorful. Warm chocolate tart for dinner, and we had a delicious dinner/dessert/drinks for under $100. Not a bad deal if you ask me.\\n\\nSide note- Sean was a great waiter. Very friendly, and he was extremely knowledgeable with the menu. Always refreshing to have that experience, seems to be a dying art form in restaurants today.',\n",

The host was very friendly and helped me check in at 7pm to ensure my seat would by ready at 7:30pm as I walked around the Paris Hotel.\\n\\nWe ordered Mussels and Frites with a white wine sauce - it was to die for. I could drink the sauce just like that.\\n\\nWe also ordered the classic steak and frites and the hanger steak and frites. Both were succulent, juicy, and tender. I always find restaurants mess up steaks a lot but not Mon Ami Gabi. \\n\\nOne of my favourite restaurants of Las Vegas and a must try for those visiting the area. The lunch menu looks amazing as well. I do recommend making reservations as this place gets busy.',\n",

Big chunks of corned beef tossed with potatoes and roasted red pepper and topped with two beautifully poached eggs. The flavors were awesome. Nice and salty corned beef cut with rich egg yolk. Bread was nice and hearty to soak up all those flavors. \\n\\nThe menu is pretty diverse, but I think I found my go-to dish here.\\n\\nI'll be going back to Vegas for a long layover, and Mon Ami Gabi is definitely on my list for breakfast before heading out of town.\",\n",

We didn't have to wait longer than 5 minutes, if even! \\n\\nService was prompt and friendly. We were greeted by our waiter almost as soon as we sat down. We ordered the warm brie, frisee salad, and classique steak frites.  The warm brie comes with 3 hard bread  slices (for spreading), roasted garlic, and hazelnuts. Roasted garlic and warm brie are two of my favorite foods, so obviously there was no room for error! The frisee salad comes with a poached egg, croutons, and a metric sh*t-ton of bacon. Not thin, wimpy bacon, either! Thick, flavorful, chewy bacon! The salad had some sort of vinaigrette that I could have lived without, but it was still a good salad! \\n\\nOur steak was cooked to order; medium. The cook was perfect and the fries were crunchy. There was an herb butter served on top, plenty to spread all over your steak! Your heart and hips will thank you later! \\n\\nI would totally visit again, especially to try their cassoulet.\",\n",

The waiters filled the water glasses constantly and we were checked on multiple times.   Fabulous ending to our vacation.',\n",
       " \"You must order steak frites when you come here. Ignore the rest of the menu and focus in on the steak. It's their specialty for a reason. Both versions of the Filet Mignon and the New York Strip Steak with bordelaise sauce were incredible. The Filet Mignon Au Poivre had more of a kick to it, but was cooked to perfection and delicious like the rest of the steaks we tried. Our knives slid through our juicy cuts of meat like butter and each bite was rich with flavor and spice. I also ordered a glass of the Pinot Noir, which was light and fruity. For dessert we tried the crème brulee, which was decadently rich and caramelized.\\n \\nReservations at Mon Ami Gabi are a necessity. I reserved through my Yelp App via OpenTable, which was easy and convenient. The patio is prime for people watching; the interior recalls a Parisian bistro.

Unfortunately, the patio was closed for a private event when I was there. \\n\\nMy family and I stopped by for a Sunday lunch/brunch. Their menu has a good variety of items so everyone should be able to find something they want. That morning, the warm chicken and brie sandwich was calling my name and I had to answer. I loved my sandwich! It was warm and creamy from the brie, sweet from the caramelized onions, and a bit tart from the green apples. I think I may have to re-create this combination at home! Accompanying my sandwich was a cone full of their fries. I\\'m not sure if I\\'d call them fries though. They were flat and wider than other fries which made them crispy in some places. It was more of a cross between a fry and a chip, a \"frip\" if you will. \\n\\nI also sampled the croque monsieur and the chicken and mushroom crepe from my family members. Both were tasty as well! My one complaint is that the butter that came with our demi baguette was cold. Why was it cold? The bread wasn\\'t warm so the cold butter didn\\'t make sense. \\n\\nFor a nice restaurant on the Vegas strip, the prices seemed pretty reasonable. The space was a bit cramped though. Be prepared to potentially bump elbows with the person at the next table.',\n",
       " \"One of the better places to eat right now on the Strip.  Nice ambiance especially if you are sitting outside at night during the spring/fall, solid service, and good food with a fairly varied menu that tends to be a bit heavy on the meat dishes.  Not the most friendly place to bring a vegetarian let alone a vegan.  Its not authentic, high-end French cuisine but then again it is Vegas.  \\n\\nSitting outside though can be a bit noisy with all of the traffic on the Strip.  You can hear your dinner companions but you have to speak up a bit.  The wait can be a bit outrageous though but that's common with any half-decent restaurant on the Strip.\\n\\nAll-in-all, there are a lot of terrible, overpriced restaurants on the Strip.  This isn't one of them.  This place is a bit more expensive but at least the food, service, and outdoor seating are all positives.\",\n",

This added a fun air of hustle-and-bustle that you might experience in a Parisian Bistro. It was fine at lunch time, but might not be what you want during a romantic date night dinner.\\n\\nI Started with the Onion Soup au Gratin, which arrived piping hot and topped with a bubbling layer of gratineed cheese. The soup itself was far too sweet and far too gloopy, a symptom of the baguette slices that had been submerged in the dish rather than floated on top of it as is traditional.\\n\\nMy entree was much better; filet of Pacific Snapper pan-fried in a light herb batter that lent a subtle texture to the fish. The fish sat on top of lobster cream and butternut squash orzo pasta, which was light and flavorful. \\n\\nThere was a broad selection of French wines available, plus a limited, but high quality selection of beers.\\n\\nI would eat at Mon Ami Gabi again.',\n",

The marmalade was so flavorful and you could tell it was all made from real lemons. I would definitely come back if I had a reservation, but the long wait is definitely off-putting.',\n",
       " \"The good: \\n\\nLocation: great location right in the front of Paris' casino. Central to the strip. Some tables have a good view of the Bellagio fountain if you wait to sit outside.\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\nStaff: Our server was very rude about confusing our order. We asked for a recommendation of chicken liver pâté or chicken liver mousse. He recommended that the pâté tastes better but is thick and not as creamy so we opted for the mousse. When the wrong dish came, he argued with us that we took his recommendation... no guy, sorry but you should have apologized and brought us the correct appetizer not stood there defending yourself that we ordered the other dish. Worst reaction a server could have \\n\\nThe food: Unfortunately all mediocre. The mousse was pretty bad (I eat mousse all the time, this was missing the gaminess and came with a stinky after taste). Our steak tartare appetizer was tiny and covered with fried onions, masking the presentation and taste of a beautiful raw beef dish. We got the daily special of steak medallions which were good, as were the side potatoes that came with it. We ordered a side of garlic spinach as well, the saltiest spinach I've ever eaten.\\n\\nThe price: I feel like I was eating at a TGI Friday's. We we're definitely price gouged for being on the strip. \\n\\nNext time I will follow my heart and eat at a celebrity chef's restaurant even though the wait may be longer. At least someone outs their name on it. Gabi and I are NOT amies.\",\n",
       " \"Entering Paris hotel and casino? Immediately turn left and you'll find this little gem that is great for brunch! Sit out on the patio overlooking the Bellagio fountain show rather than sitting indoors (which is pretty dim). If you are here before 11AM, the fountain show is only once or twice an hour, so be warned.\\n\\nThey have juicy mimosas and bloody marys accented nicely with particularly fresh celeries, but their bloody marys look watery rather than the thick consistency you would expect from the tomato liquor. Anyhow, sweet and salty cravings can be satisfied here with their perfectly done eggs any way you like them (omelettes, poached, eggs benedict--yum!) or delectable french toast. The french toast...it is a beauty, crunchy outside and stretchy/fluffy inside with blueberries dancing atop. The blueberry syrup is not syrup at all, but a puree. Make sure the bite you take with your fork has a good proportion of toast, powdered sugar, whipped cream, blueberries, and blueberry syrup.\",\n",

It was our first time with the mussels and they were just incredible. We will definitely get them again. \\n\\nI followed it up with the Steak Bearnaise which is a very thin New York I believe served with Bearnaise on the side and the best frites, my wife had the signature steak which is an 8oz filet topped with merlot butter and the same frites.\",\n",

The head wrote back immediately recommending M-A-G, and got the ball rolling for me. Eventually for a party of 10 we had a private room, our own server and sommelier. The staff invited us over early to check out the personalized menu, wine list, and to see the room.\\n\\nThanks to the advance planning, everything was smooth as butter. We had people coming and going all through the meal, and the servers didn't bat an eyelash. Thanks to our local office, we also got a lower minimum for the reserved room, which was a really nice touch, and even though we were inside we had a perfect view of the fountains. If you need to get a group meal going, this is a great place to do it. The private rooms accommodate a good number of guests, so chances are M-A-G will work. And I haven't really mentioned the food, but it was great across the board. Everyone was happy, no complaints--I think that says it all!\",\n",

They say me at a tight, small two top near the noisy bar. The greeters, etc. were very rude. Perhaps they were trained in France. The food - now there was nothing wrong there. Service was a bit slow but the food was amazing and worth the wait. Everything was delicious. I might go back here again, but even with great food when the staff is dismissive of my requests I tend to eat elsewhere. There are lots of places to eat in Vegas.\",\n",

The dish doesn't look much quantity-wise, but the quality was soo gooood. I had watched enough food channel and cooking shows to know what perfectly seared scallops look like - a little crispy on the outside, but a beautiful gradient from opaque white to a translucent white. The sauce is a little on the heavier side, so it managed to fill me up quite well. \\n\\nbut yes.... the BAGUETTE! It was so freshly made and the butter spread was also delicious.

Given the parade of strange people walking past you it is still romantic.  Food wise we had great steaks.  Mac and cheese was creamy good.   Had the \"house\" merlot and it was passable given the economy price.   Obviously the one drawback is the wait for a patio table.  1 3/4 hours, so back time when you really want to eat because you\\'ll wait. But knowing that and you\\'ll be in a good place.

I ordered a caramel latte and it had no caramel. I told the waitress and she said she would check. When she back she told me they were out of caramel and offered another beverage, which I replaced with tea. For breakfast I ordered the eggs Benedict special which replaced the Canadian bacon with mushrooms. this was pure perfection... I laid my knife into the egg to watch the yellow gloriousness ooze out and it was perfect. The second offering was over cooked and I was highly disappointed. I told the waitress and she fixed it immediately. The third issue we had was with the coffee service. Twice I had to get up and track down someone to refill my wife's coffee.

When we asked our server if he had a recipe for us or any recommendations on what to put in the Bloody Mary, he was extremely sassy and unhelpful. When the food arrived, we noticed that there was an extra order that wasn't for our table. Again, he was extremely sassy and kept insisting that someone in our party ordered it. If someone did order it, I'm not sure why we would be refusing it! \\n\\nLuckily, their delicious food kept this experience mostly positive.

A poor testimony to mandatory gratuities.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, the food here is above average and within our party of 5, nobody complained about the food.  I had Eggs Benedict and they were very good.  And, I just don't think you can complain about the venue; it is in a fantastic location and well maintained.  We've eaten here twice now & both of those things have been consistent.  And, for the location & quality of food, the price point is fair.\\n\\nAhh, but there is a catch.  Their service is poor.  The girls up front must be the manager's daughter's friends or something.  I stood there for over 5 minutes after our initial conversation before I got a response & then, only after I asked (for the 2nd time) where my party was going to be seated - and during that time, the only person to even come to the station was a person on the way out to make a quick comment.  I was early and on a mid-week day, so there wasn't a lot of traffic.\\n\\nTurns out, they don't open the patio until about 9 am.  So the little girls at the front, had me sit at an inside table (even though I requested a patio table & was told it was 1st come / 1st serve & I was there at 8:45 & I told them the rest of my party would not be there until at or after 9 am).\\n\\nWhen everyone arrived at about 9:05, they asked if we could sit outside, so I asked the bartender who to ask about that & he pointed me to the floor manager who arranged it.  This, of course was an unnecessary move, but whatever.  I left a good tip for the waitress who had served me coffee (only) and moved to the patio table.\\n\\nLater, after I received my meal, I asked my waitress for a condiment & she seemed pleased to get it.  Later, when it had not arrived and my meal was getting cold, I reminded her again & she acknowledged that she had forgotten.  Yeah, I never got that condiment.\\n\\nWhen I got the bill, an 18% gratuity was added to the bill.  Now, a couple of comments on that.  1st - the waitress told me the bill included the gratuity & that was fair of her - i've had that before, of course, but I do feel like they're trying to see if you're paying attention if they don't disclose it.  2nd - 18% is less than I typically tip for good service - but in this case, I would have tipped less, our server didn't deserve more, for sure & since I assume they share tips with the greeters, it surely would have been less.\\n\\nSo, in my opinion the food was good, the venue was excellent, and the service was below par.\",\n",

We immediately ask if we could sit outside, and the hostess is quick to tell us there is no shade whatsoever if we choose to sit out there.  (Hmm...it\\'s like over a hundred degrees today!)  So, we decide to sit inside, but as we are headed out, I notice a handful of people sitting in the blazing heat and we decide to go for it.  Smack dab in the middle of the patio and perfect for people-watching!\\n\\nIt\\'s a quick peek at the menu and we\\'re set to go!  Waters arrive shortly, along with warm French baguettes and butter.  The bread and butter is SO good, and just so French!  Yum!\\n\\nOur food soon arrives:\\n* Mussels Mariniere with frites ($21.95 full order) - Loaded with tons of onions, we start digging in.  One of my favorite things about eating mussels is the yummy sauce that comes with it, perfect for dipping warm French bread into!  What I don\\'t like is finding the beard still attached to the mussel.  Sure, I can let one go.  But there were at least four mussels were I was spitting the beard out.  Yuck.  The frites are usually one of my favorite parts too, but I wasn\\'t digging their version here.  It\\'s more like deep-fried potato sticks\\n\\n  * County Style Pate \"cornichons, whole grain mustard, country toast\" ($9.95) - The pate was just okay, nothing spectacular.  You take a piece of pate and put it on the country bread, and take a bite.  Have a cornichon too while you\\'re at it.  But it wasn\\'t something that transported me back to the French countryside.\\n\\nOur waiter also forgot The Husband\\'s Kronenbourg, which required a bit of reminding.\\n\\nService was good in the beginning with our water glass being filled often and more baguettes coming our way.  Then I think there was a shift change because all of sudden we were forgotten about and we had to wave the staff down for more water and our check.  We also noticed that we didn\\'t get any kind of dipping sauce for our frites, but noticed other tables automatically got ketchup.  I would have been happy with mayo!\\n\\nOverall, I guess I was expecting more - from the service and the food.  Everyone raves about this place, and I was left feeling underwhelmed.  The location is perfect, and if you sit outside, it\\'s fabulous for people watching and the Bellagio water fountain show.  Perhaps I\\'ll go again and further explore their menu.',\n",

The steak is definitely worth trying though. \\n\\nNote: please do not try to come here after a pool party in your cover up or bro tank, they will not let you in.

We were seated in an area that was kind of outside, but also inside (because they had all the glass windows open to the outside dining area). I was quite pleased with out seating because it afforded us a view of the outside, but kept us from the literal \"street-view\" of the Strip. \\n\\nOur server was a congenial lovely woman who definetely has a knack for serving and making her guests feel at ease. Throughout the entire meal she refilled coffees, brought Diet Pepsis out without us having to ask, and truly made an effort to romanticize our lovely French dining experience.\\n\\nWe started our meal with the Escargot, which were swimming in a potent pesto and garlic sauce. The snails\\' texture was spot-on, not chewy, simply a good mouth-feel, and the garlic, while very prevalent, added to the escargot, it did not distract.\\n\\nMy Onion Soup was served with the appetizer and I was fairly happy with the soup. I thought though it had a bit too much of a sweet taste for my liking. The crouton and cheese ratio was a bit off, with there being a just a *tad* too much cheese. I almost felt bad leaving some of it in my cup, but I had really had enough of it as I got toward the end of the cup.\\n\\nAs for my main dish I stuck with a classic - Quiche Lorraine. The flavors were mixed well - not too much of any ingredient, and the crust was classic - flaky, but not too crunchy or over-baked. Perfect for a quiche. The quiche around the outside was a bit dry, but as you moved inward it became a much better mix of eggs and cheese. \\n\\nI ended with the Chocolate Mousse - a refreshingly light dessert, yet it is chocolate so it has that little bit of decadence you want with a dessert. It has little crunchy Kit-Kat like chocolate balls on top of it and is served with some amazing whipped cream on the side. I also sampled my friend\\'s chocolate tart and believe me, that dessert is absolutely worth every penny. I sampled the Bananas Foster from my other friend\\'s plate that too was absolutely delicious.\\n\\nOverall I must say Mon Ami had good food with just a few minor flaws, but the pristine service made up for it. 5 Stars indeed.',\n",

Secondly, the service was OUTSTANDING.  The waitress even put in a special request for a specific  crepe filling not on the menu (the kitchen made it- smoked salmon, egg and jack cheese if you're curious).

There was no signage and it took at least five minutes just to find the entrance.\\nThe options are as \"American imagining French entrees\" as it gets.\\nI know this place offers other meals of the day as well, but when a French restaurant has items mostly ranging only $10-$20, and the best-looking items are served at breakfast, that\\'s a bad sign. \\nThe chicken and apple crepe I got for breakfast was average and a little too cheesy, but not in a good way. My boyfriend ordered a Benedict, and agreed that his was also average. \\nOur server was also sort of snobbish, as if she was from France and that this was the best French restaurant in town and that we knew NOTHING about French cuisine. Yuck. Won\\'t return.',\n",

Aside from the view, Mon Ami Gabi has the BEST Salmon Egg Benedict that I have ever tried. The poached egg was PURFECT done. I don't know that they did to the egg, but it just seem to have more yolk oozing out of that thing. The lemon sauce it worked so well with the entire plate. I really have no complaints about this place. I really cannot wait to tried their French Onion Soup, escargot and the beef wellington. That day will soon come!!!\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\\n\\n1.

       " \"MON AMI GABI is really what most Vegas restaurants should be -- but are not.\\n\\n1.  Indoors/Outdoors.  They have dark indoors, a big glass room semi-indoors, and an outside patio.\\n\\n2.  In a great spot.  (Under the Eiffel Tower, across from the Bellagio Fountains.)\\n\\n3.  A broad menu.  (Despite being a 'French' restaurant, it's been Americanized enough for any visitor to find something tasty on the menu.)\\n\\n4.  Prices are strip reasonable.  Meaning you're not being r-ped, which more and more is a disturbing trend on the strip.  \\n\\nSIDEBAR\\n\\nI get it that some restaurants want to be exclusive and riff-raff free.  That a dashing man and his fabulous babe want to be dressed to the nines... nowhere near the overweight shorts and wifebeater clan clasping four foot tall plastic Eiffel Tower Diabetes Cocktails.   So if such places want to charge $60 a pound for fish (Hello MILOS) you're welcome to do so.\\n\\nHowever, too much of the strip is joining in this bank account draining pricing scheme.  Places that are inside dim strip hotels, with no view, inconvenient from the street, with limited menus.  If this trend doesn't stop soon... it'll be cheaper to gamble for your dinner at a roulette table.  Seriously --\\n\\n-- may I speak on behalf of all Yelpsters and say WE DON'T GIVE A CREPE IF TABLE GAMBLING IS DOWN IN VEGAS and that can't be used as an excuse to serve $25 hamburgers.   Vegas is supposed to be fun... not a grapefruit enema.\\n\\nEND SIDEBAR\\n\\nAnyway -- MON AMI GABI still gets that.  The service -- although not really French -- is quite good and the restaurant is more than accommodating.  They did something for us on late afternoon that no restaurant has ever done for me.  I don't want to say it out loud or it might ruin it, but let's say it's akin to offering a Happy Hour hours before the actual Happy Hour starts.  NO ONE DOES STUFF LIKE THIS... but Mon Ami Gabi did.  With zero complaint.  They warned us our food might take a bit longer... but it wasn't any longer than any Vegas lunch.\\n\\nIf you want a really romantic meal, this isn't the kind of place to do it unless you get a table on the street and you LOVE noise and crowds.  However, if you like a fun place that takes you out of Vegas while somehow being in the center of it -- give MON AMI GABI a try.\",\n",

Try the brie appetizer as well, it comes with clover honey and toasted hazelnuts.  Omg.  \\n\\nAnd the view! Perfect place to people watch... and weirdo watch, since the patio is literally 10 feet from Las Vegas Blvd.  Which also means this is not the place for you if you want a quiet night out.',\n",

The espresso martini is great, and if you don't want it too sweet, get it with regular vodka instead of the vanilla. I hear the brunch is much better than dinner, but for what you get here for the cost and location, it's not a surprise it's one of the most popular restaurants on the strip.

They have a whole gluten free menu! Our server was very knowledgeable about what I could and could not have. I was even able to have gluten free bread! The filet mignon was the best I have EVER tasted (and I used to work at one of Denver's top steakhouses!)! The sauce and seasoning was absolutely savory. I have a hard time getting my meat cooked to the medium-well-plus that I like, not here! My filet was cooked EXACTLY how I love it! They even had several gluten free dessert options! When we were getting to leave our server told me that they also have great gluten free breakfast and lunch options as well.

Does it make me uncultured swine if I recommend saving the sauce so you can dip your bread in it? Prime steak frites - pretty tasty. Reasonably priced at $30, I would say. Creme brulee - OK.

Wow, the crepe was the perfect amount of delicious food to start a relaxing day and their mimosas were on point.

It was that kind of set up where there's one long booth bench with tables running parallel, and on the opposite side of the tables are chairs. Like at Le Fou Frog or The Cheesecake Factory in Kansas. I hate that seating.\\n\\nOut of so many options on The Strip, I wish we'd gone somewhere else now.\\n\\nFood: 2/5\\nFrench inspiration: 1/5\\nService: 2/5\",\n",

       " 'It seems like the old vegas standbys of coffee shops and buffets are not what they once were, namely cheap and accessible. Its not that I loved eating at the hotel coffee shop, but it is what you did. Well thankfully this trip to Vegas I did not settle for breakfast, instead walking around the strip until I found the outdoor seating at the Paris hotel. It looked to good to pass up and it was. I ended up going twice, each time enjoying the eggs and bacon, an excellent roll with chocolate, and fantastic fresh squeezed orange juice. It was such a pleasant way to start the day, with people watching being one of my favorite Vegas past times. The service was attentive, our server walked to another restaurant to get us whole bananas. The smoked salmon my wife had was much cheaper then the hotel coffee shop and great according to her. I loved this breakfast for taste, value, and simplicity. \\n\\nNext time you are in Vegas and do not want to settle for breakfast, head to Mon Ami Gabi and have a seat outdoor along LV Blvd. and enjoy the fine decision you made.',\n",
       " 'Everytime we are in Vegas, my husband and I have to stop here for a meal, lunch or dinner. It\\'s definitely become tradition at this point! \\n\\nIt\\'s French Bistro casual elegance with amazing service. Never felt like we were searching for the server, she was always near by and checking in on us. I do recommend making a reservation, otherwise the line to get in looks frustrating. \\n\\nBesides their delicious steaks (filet mignon always), the highlight for us is the chicken liver mousse pate appetizer. Everytime we order it we then say to each other \"why didn\\'t we just order two of these and call it a day\". Maybe now that it\\'s written down here we won\\'t forget next time ;)',\n",
       " \"The atmosphere here is spectacular, especially with a view of the Bellagio fountains, but the food just did not live up to all of the hype. The meal started off with some nice sangria, a delicious baguette, and french onion soup, but went slightly downhill.\\n\\nFrangria - If they're known for sangria, I am going to try it, and this place delivered on it. It was nicely sweet with all of the fruit bits soaking in it but still strong enough. I just wish it was a bit cheaper.\\n\\nFrench Onion Soup - This was the standout of the meal. It had plenty of onion flavor and a huge helping of Gruyere cheese! I actually really loved this and another bonus is that it's huge. It definitely feeds two people, no problem. \\n\\nSteak Bearnaise - The steak was chewy to the point that both the bf and I had to spit out a couple of pieces. The Bearnaise was actually cold, and from my understanding, it is supposed to be served room temperature. It wasn't very flavorful either. The frites that came with them were unexpectedly thin, but quite good. They reminded me of those little fried potato matchsticks you can buy in a tin from supermarkets. Ahh childhood nostalgia.  \\n\\nSea Scallops (entree) - I had actually ordered the appetizer version, with caramelized fennel and onion marmalade, but they mixed up my order and out came the entree with butternut squash puree and brussels sprouts. The scallops were cooked very well but everything else on the plate was not great. Perhaps this is because I'm not a fan of brussels sprouts. Also, the butternut squash puree was light and not an overpowering flavor, but again, didn't enjoy it so much.\\n\\nThe staff here was wonderful and thankfully they didn't charge me extra for the mix up. The waitress did ask if I wanted to send the scallops back for the actual appetizer but I thought I would give the entree a shot. I must say I regret that a bit.  \\n\\nI may give this place another shot in the future, but for now, my only recommendation for this place would be the bread, french onion soup, and sangria. Also, make a reservation ahead of time as this place can be pretty busy.\",\n",

This was my first time here and I was anxious to try their cuisine because I've heard great things about this place.\\n\\nIt took 30 mins to get seated since we requested the patio. We timed it well because many behind us were told 1 1/2 hrs. Our waiter was pleasant and patient with us, although there were times we wondered where he'd run off too because he kept disappearing. They brought out a warm baguette and some sort of bean salad as a starter, both were light and tasty while we looked over the menu. The bf wanted some Escargot, which I had never tried, I wasn't excited about it but told him I'd share it if he wanted it. It was better than I expected, tasted mostly like pesto. It was about as yummy as I think a person could make snails taste.\\n\\nI was leery about ordering a steak because I didn't want to be let down so in the end I ordered the Gabi's Fish & Frits but substituted the Frits for Grilled Asparagus. The bf ordered the Filet Mignon Merlot and also substituted the Frits but for the Sauteed Mushrooms. Turns out I should of ordered the steak because I liked his meal better than mine, but my meal was good too. The fish was not battered, it was crusted which was a nice surprise, I could have used a little more tarter sauce but that's just because I love it.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was perfect. Romantic and a great view of the Bellagio fountains. There was plenty of people watching to keep our interest too.\\n\\nWhen it came time to pay the bill I was horrified when my card declined. Turned out I was over my daily spending limit... stupid card. I'd only brought the one form of payment, my Debit card because I brought a little clutch out with me, not my entire purse. I went into the Casino to see if I could pull out any cash and that was declined too. The bf, not expecting to pay only had $43 on him so I was freaking out. But after talking to a manager they asked for my ID and they said they'd hold it until I came back and paid the following day. I was so relieved that they didn't make a scene or get upset. They handled it very well and I appreciated it immensely. I'll be back again, but next time I'll bring cash. :)\",\n",

We were all dressed up and ready to get our grub on. Really enjoyed the atmosphere here, and our servers were so exceptionally nice and helpful. \\n\\nBefore we ordered we got some bread and butter, and some other dish that was compliments of the chef but it was super tasty! (OMG, this reminds me, the server cleared our table and had this really cool tool that she used to get ALL the bread crumbs, I must get my hands on that thing!!!!) \\n\\nAnyway, we finally decided to order after taking a bajillion pics in our dinner dresses. At first we were expecting to eat very small portions of foods like the french people or something, but I must say the portions were all very generous and fulfilling. Everything was derricious and I couldn't have asked for better food and company for my bday! \\n\\nI would definitely visit Mon Ami Gabi again when I get the chance, but next time I'm going to enjoy my steak with the highly raved about view of the Bellagio fountains from the patio :)\",\n",

It was my first visit to the Paris hotel and casino, but it wasn't hard to find the restaurant since it's large and has a patio right on the strip. Our reservation for 5 was accommodated despite being late for our reservations. The waiter was a little quiet and hard to understand at times, and didn't really check up on us. \\n\\nSince we were having brunch, I decided on getting a Bloody Mary that you fix yourself at the bar. I've never made my own at a restaurant before, so the idea of it was fun but mine didn't turn out as good as I expected. I wish they had more garnishes instead of just celery, olives and peppers. \\n\\nFor food, we started with the escargots which were pretty good. I also had the classic quiche and I thought it tasted fine, but not something I would care to return for. My boyfriend's steak frites was the best dish I sampled. I liked the crispy fries a lot. The temperature of the steak was a bit overdone though.\",\n",
       " \"Had an amazing experience here last week  with seven other girls. Everyone's food was fresh, hot and delish. Everyone decided to have the steak so I obviously had a salad and scallops hoping to finish everyone's steak (which of course I did)!!! I had the soft boiled and bacon salad- oh so yum. Imagine a nice fresh salad covered in bacon and a warm soft boiled egg over. As you cut the egg the magical yolk pours over the salad. The salad also has little pieces of toast that soak up the egg yolk. I'm salivating as I write this. Then I had the scallops gratin which was amazing. Fresh scallops smothered in buttah and cheese baked to perfection. Get a piece of warm baguette to dip and you are in business. Then I tried everyone's steak and every style was amazing. I prefer the classic butter- medium rare but everyone style was wonderful. I love the fries too- they are fried but not greasy. Dip those bad boys in bearnaise sauce and you've got fireworks. We also had the chocolate mousse which was rich and decadent. For drinks we split the sangria which was flavorful and strong! Yum! Loved this meal.\",\n",

Mix of A/C and hot air is refreshing. Just a perfect, romantic ambiance. They really try to mimic eating in Paris\\n- Escargo (snail) dish. Every single restaurant that serves snail, I will order. (There's not many). I love the large amount of pesto and butter/oil they put on the snails, but just IMO add a little bit more salt, ask for some lemon, then it's perfect. Don't be scared to ask for more bread too. \\n\\nThe food is definitely pricy but worth it ! I came during lunch hours, so it wasn't crowded and they were very efficient in serving and accommodating your preferences, whatever it is. \\nAll the dishes were served with positive attitude and a wonderful aesthetic. Thankfully the taste is just as great, if not better, than it looks. Just order anything, because there is no sub-par or bad food here. Not many times you remember for the rest of your life what a great lunch you had. But eating here was definitely one of the times in my life when I really remember having a great lunch.

I don't like how they serve the bread with a bad and uncut. A family member had to pull it apart and I don't like getting handed a smushed piece of bread because it had to be ripped apart. We got chicken pate as a starter and that was soooooooo good! I absolutely loved it! The rest of my family wasn't crazy about it, oh well MORE FOR ME!!! I got a trout as my main course it was okay. Just nothing to special about it. Service was okay. We had to flag down our waitress most of the time but she got us everything we need and fast. I'd come here again for sure. Just for the chicken pate!\",\n",
       " \"I had eaten dinner here a couple times and was impressed.  However, the breakfast is out of this world!!!  The pancakes were amazing.  They're not traditional American pancakes, rather they're large and flat--crepe-like.  The eggs were delicious, the french toast was fantastic.  We were very impressed with the spread.  Will definitely go back for breakfast.\",\n",
       " \"After driving 8+ hours to Las Vegas from Oakland I was, needless to say, exhausted and a little cranky. After checking into our hotel room we decided to check out the Paris casino. Then we got hungry. Then we waited about 20 minutes for a table on the patio. The hostesses were partially rude, but the rest of the night was so enjoyable I promptly forgot about their aloofness. The patio is awesome because you get a great view of the Bellagio fountain and, even more importantly, there are enough heat lamps!\\n\\nOur meals were delicious (flat iron steak and a sea bass special). The best thing about the sea bass, besides it tasting like heaven, was its substantial size. Normally fancy restaurants give you a fist sized serving, but not Mon Ami Gabi. My date's steak was nothing to scoff at, either. The wine our server suggested was very good and put me in a decidedly better mood than the one I sat down with. I would love to dine here again.\",\n",
       " \"Second time here for breakfast and still amazing. Eggs Benedict is divine with fresh made in house English muffins, thin Canadian bacon and a light sauce. My husband ordered the quiche.  I usually don't eat quiche but tried it and it was the best I'd had with such great flavor! I'd order it again.  Service is always great.  I'll be back!\",\n",
       " \"We made reservation and were seated immediately. The waitress was a little odd. She asked if we have any question on the menu. I started asking her about the steak frites. One of the option was pink peppercorn and I ask her what's in it. She said it the pepper and showed me the pepper bottle. Hmm, I know what's peppercorn is but my question is what's in it. Also, she left us to chat somewhere else and we have to waive to someone else to get the check. On side note, coffee and water were refilled. She did not picked up the glass to refill it. Ahh, it's okay .. the water from the side jug was dripping to my frites. Anyway, the food was okay. The steak was more welldone than my medium liking. The frites were awesome. My honey Gabi fish was a luttle on the dry side. But the frites were sooo good!\",\n",
       " \"Five star food, but slight problems with the service and a greater problem with the ambiance.\\n\\nThe most important point here is where you sit.  They have outside seating right on the Strip - great for people watching and a view of the Bellagio fountains show.  HOWEVER:\\n1.  You can't reserve a table outside - you can get put on a list and it may be a long one.\\n2.  Despite heaters and misters, it gets hot or cold and you may want to reconsider if the outside air temperature is under 60 or over 100 (during the day, over 90).\\nIf you sit insider, where most of the tables are located, it is crowded and fairly noisy.  Some of the cushion style seats are uncomfortable, particularly if you have to sit on a seam between cushions.\\n\\nThe service is friendly and knowledgeable, but they are always in a rushs.  This is not the place for a leisurely dinner.\\n\\nOne word about the food, which is uniformly good:  the steaks frites are superior.\",\n",

       " \"A roulette dealer told me that the food quality in Vegas restaurants has really gone downhill, perhaps due to the rising meat prices. I came here in 2010 and had a lovely steak dinner. This time around I pondered trying something else so I inquired about the scallops. The waitress highly recommended them so I went for it. My friend ordered the chicken grand mere. Bread came promptly and was quite good, accompanied by whipped butter. We sat outside on a Tues early evening under a heat lamp and enjoyed the people watching. It was early enough to get a seat outside (around 6 I believe) as by the time we left the once-empty inside was full. Sadly my scallops, all four of them, arrived cold and were chewy and very bland. The squash purée was a cool temperature and there were only about five brussel sprouts on my plate. Good thing I'd eaten a lot of bread. I sent back the scallops and was told they'd be reheated. The waitress and busboy were very nice and caring. I have nothing bad to say about the service other than the waitress's bad call on the scallops. I was offered a complimentary refill of my rose champagne as I waited for my meal. Meanwhile my friend was pretty happy with his chicken but not in amazement by any means. It was juicy and was a good amount of chicken. Potato purée was tasty as were the roasted garlic and onions. Just don't expect very much of the sides. Scallops came back to me warmer but I had zero love for them. I ate them because I was hungry. They really really needed some kind of sauce. I think I know what rubber soles taste like now. It was my birthday and I was given a profiterole which was tasty. The two meals with two glasses of $11 champagne (not counting my complimentary one) plus tip came to $112. Disappointing since I'd felt like I had to force myself to eat the scallops. No enjoyment at all. Like several other places i revisiting on this trip after great experiences in 2010, I'm crossing Mon Ami Gabi off my list and will search for more consistently good places to patronize.\",\n",

       " 'Mon Ami Gabi is a French restaurant in the Paris hotel. We ended up booking some early reservations there on a night when we had no dinner plans, and were SO pleased with our dinner. We ended up getting out to eat on the patio, no problem. It was rather crowded, but we still had a good view of the Bellagio fountains. They also have heat lamps, which made it cozy since it was a little chilly outside.\\n\\nI love bread so much that sometimes I fill up on it before my entree comes out. It was very difficult not to do that with Mon Ami Gabi\\'s bread! The bread was delicious, and the butter was AMAZING. I said to my husband, \"This is like...super butter.\" Very very buttery and yummy. Phenomenal.\\n\\nI selected the skate fish for my entree and my husband selected the beef bourguinon. I thought the skate was very good - well prepared and light. The beef bourguinon was INCREDIBLE, though. Tender beef that must have simmered in the sauce for 12 hours. Rich and delicious.\\n\\nWe were stuffed by the time dessert came around. Looking back, we really didn\\'t eat a lot - we didn\\'t get any appetizers or dessert, but it remains one of the most satisfying meals I\\'ve had. The service was outstanding, as well.',\n",
       " 'For a place on the strip, the prices are actually fair. Furthermore, the meal justifies the cost. Mon Ami Gabi has an enviable location across from the Bellagio lake, just out front of the Paris hotel. The ambience is too notch, while service has always been consistently good. As a local there are few strip establishments that could entice me, but I will come here from time to time for an early breakfast. Do yourself a favor and sit on the patio or just behind the glass where you can enjoy the sunlight. A coffee with Benedict is always a good choice.',\n",

Service was great though, but it seemed as soon as we ordered our food and our waitress put it in the computer, it was on our tables!  \\n\\nStarted with the Petite Salad- Olive vinagrette had great flavor and just enough olive to be good, without being overbearing.  Friend had the Onion Soup- he loved it so much he did not share!  The soup was more the size of a super tall crock with cheese dripping down the sides, just crisp enough (the best part!)\\n\\nMain course- Steak Classique.  Huge piece of steak, and lots of butter flavor.  I was worried the steak may be lower quality based on the price, but it was actually very good, not tough, and easy to eat!   Friend had the Au Poivre, and liked his flavor, though he had a bit more fat on his steak than me (lucky me!)\\n\\nDefinitly get the Frangria (it is just like Sangria)!  It was cheapish for Vegas, and a hugh carafe of yummy wine mixed with fresh fruits.\\n\\nMon Ami Gabi is a good LV stand by- nice steak meal without paying an arm and a leg.  One point of advice- maybe order your appetizer and wait to order your main course if you do not want the meal to fly by too fast!',\n",

I found this interesting drink on the menu called \"Frangria\" and ordered a jar. It was like a French-style Sangria and it was good. My sister and mom did not enjoy it much but the drink was great to start my day. We liked the bread they served. It was hot and fresh. We ordered a Prime Rib sandwich, a Chicken and Brie sandwich, and a Seafood Crepe. Prime Rib sandwich was good. Its meat was very tender and juicy. Chicken and Brie was a little sweet, perhaps the sweetness was from the apple slices? I liked my Seafood Crepe. Shrimps and scallops were big, juicy, and cooked to perfection. However, the sauce was a little too plain and they could have put things other than green peas inside the crepe. For each plate, it came with a tiny side salad and I really like the salad dressing.

The staff was cordial and professional.\\nI would recommend this place to everyone and can\"t wait to get back - there were so many things I wanted to try; the warmed brie, the salmon spinach salad, the filet, the mussels...one plate at a time.',\n",
       " '*Heavy breathing* Ohmehgawds. Breakfast here was my favorite thing about Vegas. I think it was like $40 but I didn\\'t care, I was starveulating. Starveulation is that time of the month when you get so hungry and you wanna eat all the time but you have to be careful because if you have an unprotected meal then you can end up having a food baby... or exploding. Wallet control is recommended unless if your intention is a food baby / explosion.\\n\\nThis meal was kind of a victory meal after hiking over 30 miles and living like a savage for a few days. There might be a SLIGHT chance that my starvation made it seem a lot greater than it really was but after taking a close look at the meal photo... nah, I\\'m sure it was legitimately pretty great.\\n\\nI came here first thing in the morning on a weekday. I was greeted and seated immediately. As I was browsing through the menu I was tempted to say \"I\\'ll take one of everything\" but I decided on on the following;\\n\\n*Corned beef hash and poached eggs; Diced beef guts with remnants of potato bits. The masterfully crafted and strategically placed poached eggs drip down, encasing the beef hash in a yellow veil of amazingness.\\n\\n*Crispy date-glazed bacon; I cant promise that you\\'ll get the same but on my visit here I had perfectly crispified bacon chunks. The chef here must\\'ve been trained at le pardon glue or whatever because this was next level bacon. \\n\\n*Breakfast potatoes; Poh-tay-toes. \\n\\n*Waffles w/bananas; Soft, crispy, squish. The perfect waffles to finish off the perfect breakfast.\\n\\n\\nThe wait staff was nice and didn\\'t seem to judge me for the ridiculous amount of food I ordered for myself. Food was great and the view / atmosphere was neat. Overall, it was a really swell experience and looking at the photo of the meal made me drool a little bit just now. If you\\'re staying close by for some sort of vegas shenanigans then make sure you have someone write \"Breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi\" on your forehead with a sharpie the night before - that way you don\\'t forget, no matter how hung over or how serious of a bender.\\n\\n\\nTip: Sit outside if you can. You\\'ll be sitting under the \"eiffel tower\". If it\\'s later in the evening then you can catch the bellagio fountain show and do some people watching as you eat. Kill 3 birds with 1 meal.',\n",

You can ask for more if you run out!\\nI ordered the blueberry french toast that came with a blueberry sauce and whipped cream. Really loved the whipped cream, but the blueberry sauce was way too sweet for me.\\nMy friend ordered the corned beef hash that came with a side of hash browns and it was the best dish at our table. My group also ordered the salmon eggs benedict, seared salmon, and steak. \\nThe poached eggs for the benedict was a little over-poached, so there was no yolky-goodness that everyone enjoys seeing.

One of those non-talking couples where it's so awkward you don't want to even say anything because you know they're listening. At one point the wife stuck her hand into her water cup, grabbed a bunch of ice cubes, and threw them on the table saying, 'there's too much damn ice.' WHO DOES THAT?! Eesh..hint to husband: DIVORCE IS THE ANSWER.\\n\\nOn our right were two men in their mid-sixties who were a bit overly friendly. Right when I stuffed my mouth with bread they turned to ask about what we were eating. Can't I just open my mouth and show you? It was actually comforting to have pleasant people sitting next to us though with the ice queen on the other side but being constantly interrupted when I'm EATING is a Mari no-no.\\n\\nGf and I spent the whole dinner trying to figure out if our waitress was a twin and if her sister worked there too, or if she was just one person. Different versions of our waitress would serve us- one with glasses, one without, one with a jacket, one without, and she'd change her hair too. We finally realized it was one person but gf swore she was doing it on purpose to mind f*** us.\\n\\nBUT ANYWAYYY.. the food. We decided go out straight after dinner and I had the bright idea of wearing a corset. I was cased up like a sausage..and still ordered the steak frites. Which was damn good, juicy and rare, even though I couldn't really breath. Bite, inhale, chew fast so I don't pass out. And their dirty martinis are smooth sailing. Our meal came out to about $90 something which is a little pricey but we got drinks so it's explainable. What I like about Mon Ami is that it's casual but still has that bistro charm.\\n\\nIt was worth changing in the car into something roomier, flashing the strip as we drove by.

I'm not going to lie, we asked for more--I just won't tell you how many times we asked for more.\\n\\nOur food was delicious. My party ordered scallops, steak, salmon, crab so I made sure to sample every single dish and they were all amazingly good. Simply a delight. The salmon melted in my mouth and was accompanied by a quinoa salad. The scallop plate had just the right amount of bacon and was served with greens. The steak came with fries! Two of my friends shared the sea food platter and devoured it. At the end of the meal Mon Ami brought out ice cream for my birthday and sang to me!\\n\\nWe left the restaurant feeling full and happy.

They cover with some sort of wine/butter sauce which then gets soaked up by the potatoes.  SCORE!  The French Onion soup is the best I've had.  And I know my FO soup.

Thankfully we only waited roughly 45 mins & we were even seated outside :) YAY lucky us!\\n\\nTables and seating arrangements were really narrow. Complimentary bread was pretty yummy - your typical french bread. Except they gave butter and this interesting shredded carrot spread. Oddly enough, it was actually quite good with the bread. LOL!\\n\\nI ordered the steak classique with maitre d hotel butter. ($23.95), which is a large thin cut of steak with an herb butter sauce. It was good but nothing outstanding. The meat was a large piece, but thin so when asked for medium, it was more medium well to well done. The fries that accompanied it were overfried & overly crispy.  \\n\\nThe rest of my party wasn't too impressed as well. They got the filet mignon, steak bordelaise, and scallops. Our table rated the scallops as the best thing that night.\\n\\nAmbiance was nice, romantic, but over crowded so it kinda killed the romance. Service was just okay. Kinda had to ask for refills on bread & soft drinks. They were good about refilling water though. Best thing about the place is sitting outside on the patio watching the bellagio show while eating.

If you\\'re entire party is not at the host desk they won\\'t seat you, even if you\\'re just waiting for the elderly members of your party to walk through the casino to get to the restaurant.

The food here is worth a little wait though, as they really do strive to be authentically french in sin city.

It really is a combination of the ambiance and the food, how can you go wrong when you are sitting outside, enjoying french food, faced with the spectacular performance of the Bellagio fountains, topped with the shockingly, in-your-face exposure of the best people watching in Las Vegas. I love it! Having worked in the fashion business for years, largely based in New York, I am thoroughly convinced that the true pleasures of Vegas demands that every man and women dig deep into their closet and find that outfit that screams 'take me to Vegas', chosen completely for our entertainment.  Keep in mind, you choose to go at a busy time and want to sit outside, as half the world does in the nice weather, you need to strategically pick that off moment or you will have a long wait. Everyone wants to sit outside. \\n\\nOk, now lets address the food, it is excellent for the most part. I always seem to order the Steak and Frites Classic and it is delicious, however, my only pet peeve, which I always forget to mention, is that when I ask for the sauce on the side they bring it near frozen. I never get that, I think the obvious thing would be to serve it slightly heated rather then chilled. Well, they never fail to do it and if I can't get my ducks in order to  remember to point that out. By the way, the muscles are to die for. I also recommend that you sign up for their rewards program to earn points. It is worth it as we were just there the other day and I had a $40.00 credit, nice perk, It bought my wine.\\n\\nI have always had great table service with interesting waiters/waitresses and the busser's are on it. But, it is a hit-miss with the hostess stand. I have this frustration with those holding the 'first' position who cannot look me in the eye and giggle between each other. My experiences have often started with an unpleasant and often somewhat confused hostess. Unlike a tourist, I am a sure thing, as I know what is behind the door, but if I was a visitor there are many occasions where I would simply pass on the wait due to the rude, impersonal interaction with the host.

The one thing that was really good was my wine and they didn't make it!  I am pretty sure this elusive brioche was wonder bread with the crust cut off, the goat cheese salad was more bitter greens then anything else and the filet was overdone.  You ma ask how can you go wrong with pomme frites?! well they tasted like French's fried onions that you put on top of green bean casserole.  not good.

The first thing I noticed was the numerous servers standing around, and just chatting with each other.  They were definitely overstaffed.\\n\\nI got the bartenders attention, and ordered a glass of Bordeaux.  I was bothered that she served it to me in a small white wine glass.  I noticed that other patrons were served in Bordeaux glasses, but she elected to just quickly give it to me.  She even opened a new bottle, and did no offer me a taste.\\n\\nThis was basically how the entire meal went for me.  I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt, and she definitely gave the attention to an older gentleman wearing a suit at the end of the bar. I usually don't weigh service as an issue at restaurants, but I do take offense when I am ignored for wearing a t-shirt, or if nobody says goodbye to me when i leave.  I definitely had an experience with both of these at the restaurant.\\n\\nTo eatm I had the filet and a side salad.  Both were mediocre, and nothing fantastic.  If I was rating the food alone, this would be a 3 star dinner.  However, the service clearly makes me drop Mon Ami down by at least a star.  In my opinion, for the price, 2 stars is very generous.

Quick, attentive and friendly.\\nSteaks are tender, perfectly cooked and the bordelaise is very good.  Fries are good as well, although I personally don't rank them as highly as others here.\\nAnd yes, you are on a patio on the strip, which means the odd drunken frat boy will pull you from your daydream of a cafe by the Seine and onto an episode of Jersey Shore.  And that means that occasionally, what sounds like the entire North American contigent of the Hells Angels will make the wine glasses shake, and that occasionally a billboard truck will drive by offering....well, its Vegas, you know.\\nBut it doesn't matter.  Because every fifteen minutes you and everybody else on the patio, the sidewalks and even on the street stop to watch the Bellagio fountains.

We liked the restaurant and the service so much we came back for dinner after the concert. My wife had the Casareccia Pasta and I had the Classique steak. Not sure how the food came out as fast as it did. My steak was excellent so why the 3 stars? Well, to say that my wife\\'s pasta was uneatable would be a drastic understatement. The truffles were so salty that I (a salt lover) could not eat the dish. So we shared my steak. Accidents happen so the review is not for the salty pasta, no it is for the server and manager. If we had not had the excellent lunch and my steak then this would have been a one star review. As a restaurant owner I do not like giving (or receiving) bad reviews. That is why I have taken so long to post this one. All would have been ok if the server would have cared just a little bit when I brought my concern to her attention. I asked for a manager (because I wanted to treat them as I would like to be treated, that is let them know that if my wife\\'s pasta was way too salty then others may be also) and she simply turned her back and walked away. I paid and on our way out addressed my concerns with who I believed was the manager. It may just be Vegas, but I have never had such a \"I don\\'t give a sh..\" attitude from a server or manager.

At around 9pm, while still waiting for a table I saw the fireworks outside and clear as day. I will never make a reservation or come here on the Fourth of July again in the future.\",\n",

Don't bother telling your waiter/waitress how you like your steak cooked because the less-than-half-an-inch thick slice of beef will come out well done regardless.

We were started off with complimentary bruschetta, which was delicious, although a little hard to eat since we had to cut the bread outselves (they gave us a full loaf).\\n\\nFor our steaks, Gardenia got the Filet Mignon Au Poivre (creme fraiche) and Keri got the Bone-in Ribeye (22 oz with bearnaise sauce). I no longer remember what their steaks were like, but we unanimously agreed that mine was best. So what did I get? I listened to all the Yelpers on here and got the Filet Mignon Merlot (butter, red wine reduction). I got it medium rare and it was DELICIOUS. So tender and flavourful. I still think it was one of the best steaks I have ever had. And all their steaks come with their signature hand-cut fries, which are also really good. Keri also got Whipped Cauliflower as a side. It was just fine to me (I'm not a fan of cauliflower), but I think Keri liked it. And for dessert, we got their Bananas Foster Crepe (warm bananas, foster sauce, vanilla ice cream). Such a perfect (and delicious) way to end the meal :)\\n\\nThe patio was a little crowded, but it was still a great experience. They do not seem to have a bathroom inside the restaurant, I was told to go inside the casino and use their bathroom (it was a 30-second walk from the front of the restaurant).

Upon instruction we arrived prior to our 7pm reservation, and were put on a waiting list for a patio table. Our wait was maybe 20 minutes (but I'm sure it's longer later in the evening and/or on weekends). Our table was not right on the edge of the fence which is probably best if you don't prefer to be very close to people walking by. I had really hoped that the view of the Bellagio fountain show would have been better. I knew it wasn't going to be great, but I forgot to take into account how many times buses and those ridiculous call girl advertisements go by. You can faintly hear the music, but overall if you want to see the fountain show don't plan on seeing it from MAG. Even though it was probably 90 degrees outside it was still very comfortable on the patio. I'd hate to see their electric bill, but from our table we could easily feel the air conditioning from the building. Our waiter was nice but not overly chatty. Even though we know it is just the French style the complimentary baguette was way too hard for my husband's taste, and it unfortunately went to waste for us. We ordered two of their steaks (Bordelaise and Roquefort) and thought they were okay. Their steaks are very thin cuts of meat so cooking them to temperature seems difficult. Their signature 'frites' were good, but not exactly what I would go out of my way to order to go with a steak. For dessert I had the chocolate mousse and my husband had the strawberries briand. They were both delicious and by far the best part of our meal. The strawberries for the briand were perfectly ripe and such a nice clean dessert after something like steak. Since it was my birthday our waiter even brought a little creme puff with an ice cream center with a candle. Such a lovely gesture and nice ending to our meal.

       " 'Whenever we\\'re in Vegas, we have dinner at Mon Ami Gabi, our favorite restaurant in Vegas.  We were there for Thanksgiving dinner this year and had an outstanding turkey dinner. So, knowing that turkey was again on the menu and we would be in Vegas for Christmas, we happily made reservations at Mon Ami for 6:30 PM on Christmas Day.  \\nWith reservations, the wait is minimal.  And, so it was this Christmas Day.  We were seated by a window overlooking the famed Bellagio Water Fountains.  We settled in for a romantic dinner.  The server, who (and I kid you not) was the spitting image of Flo from the Progressive car insurance commercials.  She flew by and said, \"We\\'re out of turkey.\"  Huh?  How can you be out of turkey at 6:30 PM on Christmas Day? We had much a much later reservation on Thanksgiving and there was plenty of turkey then.  \\nWhen the server returns, we tell her how disappointed we are about the turkey.  We were looking forward to their excellent turkey dinner for Christmas.  She didn\\'t apologize. She shrugged and asked for our order.  We asked for a couple more minutes and it was obvious by the look she gave us that she wasn\\'t happy with us.\\nWe decided to have appetizers (oysters for me, salad for hubby) and split a steak with pommes frites.  After she took our order, we overheard another server telling his table about the evening\\'s specials.  We then realized our server had never mentioned them to us.  \\nWhen hubby saw the manager, Constantine, walking by, he asked him to stop by our table.  We shared how disappointed we were not to have turkey on Christmas.  He profusely apologized and told us we had every right to be upset. he had already received complaints about running out of turkey.  He said someone in the back had not ordered enough turkey for the weekend.  He wanted to make it up to us when the check came.  \\nHubby had asked for a glass of ice when he ordered his wine.  When the server came back with the appetizers, he reminded her that he still didn\\'t have his glass of ice.  She promised to bring him one as soon as possible.  As she walked past me, I heard her say, \"Christ!\"  Finally, halfway through dinner, the glass of ice came.\\nAfter dinner, we asked the server to see the dessert menu.  I asked for coffee while we waited for the menu.  I got my coffee and we waited and waited.  Finally, she comes not with the menu but with our check.  When hubby reminded her that we wanted to have dessert, she said, \"You said you didn\\'t want dessert, only coffee.\"  Not wanting to argue, we asked for the menu again.  By the time it came, I was ready to leave.  Dinner was a big disappointment.  \\nConstantine, however, came through.  He gave us a 50% discount off our meal.  We thank you, Constantine.  You were a class act!  \\nYes, we\\'ll come back.  Their food is delicious and their location is perfect.  We\\'re chalking the experience to an off night.  Every restaurant has one and unfortunately we were there for Mon Ami Gabi\\'s.',\n",

We started with the mussels - so delicious!  I'm a sucker for mussels in wine and butter sauce, especially when we have bread to dip in the sauce!  My mother had the hanger steak which was perfect in a semi-sweet glaze.  I had the filet mignon in merlot sauce which was amazing!  Every bite melted in my mouth like a perfectly cooked medium-well steak should.  Our server suggested the Beaujolais wine to pair with my steak - and it was indeed a perfect match!  I've never had fries with steak, but the frites that the steaks came with were equally delicious.  \\n\\nI'm so glad this place exists, and will definitely be coming back!

So at the end that place billed us twice for dinner probably thinking that we would not notice. When we asked for explanations manager told us that it\\'s an \"unintentional error by the cash register\". Not that I expected him to tell us that they wanted to steal our money, but blaming the machine is also not a good idea as waiters are supposed to check what they input there.

It's really hard to miss with their gorgeous sidewalk cafe with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. My family and I ate here for our little brother's birthday. I have to give them a lot of credit for service because we gave them an almost impossible feat. Due to poor time management on our part, we had a little over an hour before we had to get to our show. Our server somehow managed to expedite our food and we were able to get to our show on time. \\n\\nWe started with the classic Caesar Salad and their house bread which came with some carrot slaw. I actually didn't care for it much. It was really ordinary and I've definitely had better at a much lower caliber restaurant. The bread was good though and so was the carrot slaw that came with it. For our entrees, we ordered the Fish and Chips, the Cheeseburger with frites, and Roasted Chicken. Sounds like ordinary dishes but they were executed perfectly. Everything was seasoned nicely, and cooked right. The fish was really good. Probably the best piece of fish I've had at a restaurant. My little brother enjoyed his chicken dish and pretty much inhaled it. I think the frites here are pretty special. I haven't had fries quite like these before. Thin and perfectly crispy. Loved them. \\n\\nI want to come back and have a longer meal next time. Come check it out because it's well worth the money. Next time,  brunch it is! 4/5\",\n",

Never have I been at a restaurant that brings a gf bread option to begin the meal. Lovely.\\n\\nIf you're searching for gf vegan menu, this restaurant doesn't offer that,  but many of the side options listed on the regular menu, such as brussels sprouts and sautéed mushrooms, are gf. Two typical desserts conclude the menu, chocolate mousse and creme brûlée. Both options are good, but take the waiter's advice and try the brûlée instead. The waiter informed my boyfriend that the bread pudding is rated #5 top foods to eat in Las Vegas, but you must ask for it--it isn't listed on the menu. \\n\\nOverall, great menu, fantastically kind service, reasonable prices, and comfortable seating both indoors and out.

Basically a perfect setting for a patio on the strip. \\n\\nNow for the food. We ordered the onion soup. A big bowl. Very sweet. Maybe we should have added a little salt. I liked it. Wife was \"meh\". \\n\\nWe both got steaks. Wife got filet. I got the NY Strip. We ordered medium rare, and both came medium (or a little more--no pink). I was OK with that, but my wife sent it back. Waiter came back with a totally rare steak! I mean pretty much raw from about 1/4 in to the middle. We asked for a medium rare steak, so sent it back again. Waiter came back with a medium steak. Ug. I was halfway done, so my wife decided to eat it. It was good, but not what she ordered. We chose to stop complaining since we didn\\'t think it would do any good.\\n\\nAt any rate, I recommend the place, but check your steak when you get it. If it comes wrong, send them ALL back since you want all your food to come out at the same time. Ask for the manager too, maybe at least they can comp you the food. We should have done that.',\n",

I miss this place, be sure to stop in for brunch or a nice dinner when you're aain town.\\n\\nThe duck confit is simply divine. If you're in the mood for soup, everything is absolutely delicious. My personal favorites are the obvious, French onion, and potato leek. The potato leek soup is smooth, and a perfect blend of flavors. Any of their sandwiches are a good choice, beef dip and another with chicken and caramelized onions were both super delish. If you're in the mood for brunch, I highly recommend their waffles or an eggs Benedict (crab is yummers). They had an awesome bloody mary bar the last time I stopped in...take advantage if you enjoy them.\\n\\nThe service has always been wonderful. On nice days there is an outdoor patio, but the inside ambiance is also enjoyable. Dimly lit, pretty romantic.

They have plenty of heat lamps outside so you shouldn't be cold if it's on the colder side outside.  You can't go wrong sitting inside either if you prefer that.  If you sit close to the window near the strip, you should still see the Bellagio and the water display.  You probably won't hear the music that goes with it.  If you sit deeper inside the restaurant, you won't see the Bellagio or the water display at all.  But the lighting is dark and the restaurant is romantic.

It actually reminded me of any brasserie in Paris. \\nIf the weather is nice out and you want to sit at the Patio, definitely make a reservation ahead of time because the line gets long. The line for indoors is actually really short and pretty quick. \\n\\nThe service is simply amazing. Our waiter was very very professional and helpful. We went for brunch and food was very tasty. I got the chicken and mushroom crepe, which was very cheesy and filling! \\n\\nDefinitely want to come back before I leave Vegas!',\n",
       " \"We had reservations for 645PM and we were running late because of traffic on the strip and they still gave me my Opentable points... YAY!  I know a lot of restaurants who wouldn't do that.  My only complaint was that they seated us in the bar area of the restaurant which was really crowded with people around the bar, I would think they would sit us in the main room since we did have reservations.  The food was to die for.  The bread was super fresh from the oven... I wanted to eat more but did not want to ruin my appetite.  I ordered the Filet Mignon Au Poivre, medium rare... which was perfect and the creme fraiche made it all the better.  The meat was so tender and it melted in my mouth.  The pommes frittes were so good too.  Our server was really nice but a little creepy at the same time? haha, it's hard to explain.  All in all it was a great meal... my mouth is watering just thinking about the filet.\",\n",
       " 'My Favorite restaurant in Vegas. \\n\\nStunning view of the water at the Bellagio. I recommend sitting on the outdoor patio.

       " \"After dining at this restaurant I'm perplexed by how anyone can give it less than 5 stars. We had dinner here on a gorgeous Saturday around 5pm. We were seated outside right along the strip. The weather was perfect and we were enjoying the people watching and the Bellagio's water shows.\\n\\nThe staff was on point, hustling around tending to the patrons needs and wants. We shared a couple bottles of wine. I ordered the pork medallions wrapped in bacon. Hello? Pork wrapped in pork! How can you go wrong? My medallions were complemented with the accompaniment of what I'm going to say was a quince and yellow raisin chutney. My cousin had ordered the cheese plate which came with some fresh crisp apple slices, raisin bread, walnuts, dates and a fig spread. I tasted the cheese and all three were fantastic. \\n\\nI also liked the vibe in the indoor dinning rooms of this establishment. Mon Ami is definitely getting added to my list of great  places for a casual yet memorable meal in Vegas.\",\n",

I ordered the eggs Benedict which was really good. I had mentioned it before that for me what makes a good sandwich is good bread and this was gooood bread.

       " '\"A BEAUTIFUL BISTRO\"\\n\\nI lived in France in the 1960s and any restaurant re-creating that era has me at \"classic, traditional...\" Mon Ami Gabi doesn\\'t disappoint in so many ways, but does fall a bit short at fully recreating the classic French bistro.\\n\\nThe walls are deep and lustrous wood, the interior rooms are larger than most \"classic\" bistros, but the feeling is very much the same. This visit there wasn\\'t much noise inside, and the atmosphere wasn\\'t stuffy and oozed comfort and charm.\\n\\nOutside on the patio, where I ate (after waiting 40 minutes on a first-come, first-serve basis) there were booming American voices, and a lack of intimacy with street pedestrians that pervaded traditional French bistros.\\n\\nI wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but settled for the classic \"basics\": escargot and onion soup. The flavors were perfectly balanced, but... the escargot were not in their shells, they were served with a spoon (broke my heart), and while the flavors were on point, there was a greasiness to the herbed butter that seemed totally out of place to me.\\n\\nThe onion soup was virtually \"stuffed\" with melted Gruyère, so yummy and perfect, the soup itself brought back many exceptional food memories, but the onions were almost non-existent. In their place was a huge amount of bread.\\n\\nThe service was fair to poor. When I sat down I asked for water with lemon and got water without lemon. I had to ask for bread after my escargot were served (can you eat escargot without bread???!!) I asked for my onion soup to be served after my escargot, but it came when I was only halfway through my first course. \\n\\nMy waitress comped a dessert due to the uneven service, but didn\\'t offer me a choice. Having had bread with the escargot and onion soup she brought me bread pudding, not exactly a French classic.\\n\\nWhen I asked for \"l\\'addition\" (the check) I said it in French because I hoped the wait staff were trained to understand that one word - but it was a false hope. \\n\\nMore like an American in Paris than a classic French bistro, but still well worth experiencing.',\n",
       " \"Let me start by saying we love the food, love the service, and love sitting on the patio at Mon Ami Gabis.  \\nTonight, everything was as good as usual except sitting directly across from us was a young woman and her partner....she was in a bikini with a dirty towel wrapped around her waist.....really?  Have we finally sunk this low in Las Vegas that this is appropriate at a casual fine dining restaurant on the strip?\\nThe best part was that I complained to the manager, through our waitress, and she suggested we could move.  We were appropriately dressed and we could move?   She didn't even come out to talk to us or check out the situation.....very unprofessional.  So she alienated locals who used to dine there 5-6 times a year to champion a 20 year old in a bikini and dirty towel who will probably never be back again.  \\nSmart.....very smart.....\",\n",

Try to eat outside on the patio, not only will you get to enjoy a lovely meal amidst the bustle of the Strip, but you will also get a great show from the Bellagio across the street.

Those heat lamps are strong, we got so toasty that we started sweating. The view was amazing, you can people watch and also enjoy the Bellagio fountains.

I was thinking German pancakes at Ihop but they were more crepe-like.  I think they would have been better a bit more dense, spongy, as opposed to flaky and almost crispy and dry on the ends.

I wasn't going to wait that long, which undoubtedly took away from some of that ambiance. The food was alright, not necessarily the best. The unfortunate thing is that everyone at the table got a steak of some kind so really this is just a review of their steak dinners. They have quite a few steak options all ranging from the least expensive hanger steak to filets. The steak was cooked perfectly, but I don't think it separates them from any other restaurant in the area. The service was excellent, which is to be expected with the caliber of this place. I'd absolutely go back and try different menu options to get a better idea of the food quality and to try and grab a table outside. If you're enticed by the outdoor dining option, give it a go. If you don't feel like waiting over an hour to watch the fountain show and people watch, but still want quality French food, head over to Comme Ca at The Cosmopolitan.

Hands down this is one of my favorite places to dine when I am in town, and I can honestly say I have never been disappointed. This classic French bistro serves magnificent food in a wonderful atmosphere, and at a fair price. Thier position on the strip also offers a terrific view of the Bellagio.\\n\\nAs soon as I boarded my flight from NY this morning my mouth was drooling with anticipation. Thier steak frites are absolutely amazing, and will melt in your mouth with orgasmic bliss. I knew that I would be dining alone tonight, so I did not even make a reservation as the bar area is a great spot to eat here, especially the one out facing the strip with a view of the Bellagio water show. I just winged it and ended up with a prime spot sitting and conversing with other single visitors in town enjoying a meal at the bar.\\n\\nI ordered  a glass of Pinot Noir, and chose the Steak Frites Bordelaise. Tender steak sliced thin, almost like a flank steak, with carmelized onions, and a red wine sauce ladeled over the top. Crispy and thin frites with just the right amount of saltiness accompanied the steak. I bit into the first bite and - OH -MY-GOD - I wanted to melt off my bar stool right then and there. The exquisite taste of the steak along with the carmelized onions just put a smile on my face the whole time I was there. I think everyone around me had the same look of satisfaction from what they were eating too. I went absolutely all piggy and finished every bite of steak and frites on the plate. I even soaked up the extra sauce on the plate with this amazing hot mini baguette of crispy bread they serve with the meal.\\n\\nIt was all so good I totally ignored the booming sounds of the water show going on across the street. As I settled up the bill I was glowing in the aftermath of total satisfaction. Just a perfect place to have a great meal in a civilized atmosphere wether it be a date or a group. As I walked down the street back towards my casino hotel I felt as if I was floating two inches above the ground. Drool is already forming at the corner of my mouth writing this review!\",\n",

I split a mushroom omelette - big mistake, the portions here are not as big as Hash House lol so definitely coulda finished this on my own. The mushroom omelette was pretty good.

I\\'ve been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time.\\n\\nMy friend said the steaks were really good, so I knew I would definitely get a steak frites.  The server said the prime rib with bearnaise sauce was really good.  Instead of the prime rib, I opted for the steak with bearnaise sauce.\\n\\nNow I\\'m no expert on bearnaise sauce, but I thought the one at Mon Ami Gabi had no flavor except for butter.  It just tasted like melted butter.  I was expecting more creaminess to it with more herbs and flavor other than butter...\\n\\nThe steak was very thin.  I tried a piece of the filet mignon merlot and it was much thicker and nicer.  However, my steak was too thin and I did not particularly enjoy it.\\n\\nAs for the fries... they were disappointing because they are cut like really thin strips, and they give you a lot!  But honestly to me, it felt like eating kettle cooked chips and crumbs from the bottom of the chips bag.  Not a fan of that, especially in a huge amount (lots of it went to waste).  I prefer thin fries which are crispy on the outside and with some potato texture on the inside.  Some other people in the group really liked the fries though.\\n\\nThe service was alright.  They were nice but they were handing out the wrong plates... come on now.\\n\\nThe complimentary bread was very good, freshly baked and crusty.  It was served with butter and a mixture of pickled shredded radish, apple and parsley.\\n\\nI may come back to try other items on the menu, maybe for lunch.  Now I just know not to get the fries or the cheaper steak.',\n",

       " 'The best thing I ate whilst in Vegas over the past 4 days I was there.  I wish we could have sat out on the patio, but it was so cold and windy that night!  The ambiance is dark and romantic, yet warm and welcoming.  It has an old French decor and charm with a great waitstaff.  I was able to grab a reservation for a party of 4 in the cab on my way to the restaurant!  \\n\\nI ordered a salmon which came on a bed of quinoa.  It was cooked perfectly and the citron butter flavor really complimented the fish.  It was light but still filling, and best of all, healthy.  I also had a good chunk of the beef short ribs and the hanger steak, which were both amazing as well.  For $20 a steak that good is a great deal.  The only complaint I have is the frites, which are more like potato chips instead of fries.  I think actual fries would have given the dish more substance, but it IS their signature hand-cut frites...  \\n\\nThe menu was simple enough but not underwhelming, food, ambiance, and service was great, and for the quality of the food, these prices seriously cannot be beat.',\n",

Seafood was fresh and succulent, the glass of chard I had to accompany was really lovely too. The atmosphere feels cozy like a french bistro even though it's enormous.

The make-your-own-Bloody Mary bar is a highlight when it's offered, but otherwise the cocktail list is very good, and the food is delicious. I've never had a meal here that I didn't enjoy.\\n\\nThe only issue I've ever encountered here is that it can be very crowded and very busy; there are occasional moments where it is difficult to flag down your server (thus my star deduction)--in particular, the server mutilated the split check we requested, charging me a couple of pennies while my friend was charged the balance, and it took nearly five minutes to get his attention after we discovered the error (he promptly fixed it, though, and was extremely apologetic).\\n\\nAn important note: Reservations are not possible if you want to eat on the outdoor terrace patio thing--you just have to stand in line and wait. However, I feel like the patio is overrated, since it can be quite hot and you'll be just inches away from drunk people who are smoking/screaming/doing whatever. Really--truly--eating outside on the Las Vegas Strip is not worth the wait or the grief. Believe me. Don't be a noob. Do yourself a huge favor and just eat inside where there is sweet, sweet air conditioning--you can make yourself a reservation online on OpenTable.com and bypass the line.\",\n",

The food on the other hand was so so .But then again, I got their onion soup, and perhaps I should have gone with something else, but my throat wasn't feeling so good so I decided to get something warm. The cheese was all clumped together as one huge chunk, and there was a large piece of bread stuffed inside the soup that was soggy. The soup itself tasted just ok, but slightly salty for my taste. The brie cheese with chestnuts was delicious, and I would definitely recommend it. \\n\\nHowever, I'm willing to come back to try more food from the menu, and you really can't beat the scenic view.\",\n",

Big thick slices.  Even the jam was like homemade. I know it is only toast but it was so good. I had the Eggs & Beef Bourguignon, bacon, mushrooms, pearl onions for $11.50. The eggs where pouched and huge. I think they might have been duck eggs. Very rich dark yokes like free range grass feed poulty give you. The stew was very rich and tasty. Coffee is great and my server was always there to fill it up. I also ordered the flaky Pain Au Chocolat for $3.50.  My husband had the made by scratch blueberry waffles for $10.95. He said they where the best he has had. Looking at other people plates made me wanting to try it all. Next trip for sure.\",\n",

The warmed brie is delicious, the salad with bacon and an egg, the pork paillard, and the roast chicken are also good. The sangria carafe is great too if you don't want to buy a bottle of wine. The location (can watch the Bellagio foundations) and service were good too!\",\n",

My French Onion soup was bland -- like beef broth poured on bread with melted cheese. My seafood crepe was way too salty. On top of the crepe were 3 shrimp and 2 scallops -- all were over grilled, making them tough and tasteless. The Bloody Mary was just not good. I always finish my drinks, but could not finish this one. I think I will choose the breakfast menu next time I go.',\n",

The wild safari animals one with big cats.)\\n\\nWe were seated, and the waiters immediately brought water, bread and butter. it was so delicious, and the warm bread tasted just as fresh and as when I was in Paris. After putting in our orders, one of the waiters spilled a flask of water behind us and apologized! We didn't even care nor did the water splash on us. But within a few minutes, he brought an appetizer FREE of charge! :D Our waiter was also french! Or maybe he just pretended to have a french accent, but he was really on top of it, and made nice conversation on our meal, day, and Vegas trip. \\n\\nAppetizers Ordered: Escargot, scallops, and oysters! Oysters were really fresh with the lemon! Escargot also as excellent as when I ate them in Paris! Scallops were a little small, but still thoroughly enjoyable and delicious to eat.\\n\\nWine: Ordered a merlot and it was excellent! Tasted so well with our dinner.\\n\\nMain Course: I ordered the salmon with rice. I thought it looked a little small to be honest, and the salmon a bit overcooked. But the rice was excellent, and salmon still pretty fresh and enjoyable. Not the most amazing salmon I've ever had, but it did its job.\\n\\nAll while eating dinner, the Bellagio had its water show and the night was perfect! We also got a small birthday cake/ice cream for my sister and it was awesome blossom!\",\n",

Our food had cold French fries that were hard to chew so we asked for fresh ones...and the fries and French bread were the best part of the meal. My chicken was flavorless and dry (I could buy better roasted chicken at the store) and my mushrooms were sautéed so much they were burnt black. My husband could have bought a better burger somewhere else (He said Carl's Jr would have been better). They need new management and a new chef. :(\",\n",

       " \"On my recent trip to Vegas, Mon Ami Gabi stood out as not only the most delicious and memorable restaurant, but probably the most bang for your buck.\\n\\nWhile it was a Sunday night, we decided to err on the side of caution and make a reservation. Good call, it was pretty busy! We were quickly seated by a friendly hostess and our server brought us a great, crusty baguette and an amuse bouche, which was a pickled carrot. While I enjoyed the pickled carrot, the bread was what really stood out. It was everything I wanted and more. It was so perfect to sop up all of the sauce for the appetizer we ordered (escargot). So, I don't have snail very often, but I always order it when I see it on a menu and I have to say the escargot at Mon Ami was exceptional. It was cooked very nicely and wasn't chewy (sometimes it feels like I'm eating a rubber band when I order escargot). The sauce was buttery and garlicky, and as I mentioned, every drop of sauce went to good use when sopped up with the perfect bread.\\n\\nFor an entree, I had the braised lamb shank which was not only a huge portion, but was ridiculously moist and tender. The meat was completely falling off the bone and was flawlessly seasoned. Best of all, the sides were also solid. Couscous, almonds, raisins, and root vegetables. The sweet chewiness of the raisins paired well with the crunch of the almonds and the earthy caramelization on the vegetables. My dinning companion had the poisson frites, which were also exceptional. The frites consisted of a huge filet of white fish that was delicately coated and fried. Don't order this if you are expecting fish and chips, because this is far superior. The coating was crunchy but understated and the frites were practically paper thin and were airy. \\n\\nThroughout the visit service was friendly and attentive, and I rather enjoyed the ambiance. \\n\\nThe best part? The bill. An appetizer, two entrees, a few cocktails and beer.... less than $100. In a city where Starbucks charges over $5 for an americano, I was expecting more damage considering the high quality and huge portion. It was one of the cheapest meals of the trip and it was by far the most delicious. I cannot recommend it enough!\",\n",
       " \"My sister and I stayed at Paris and ate here several times.  We had breakfast our first morning there on the patio, dinner take out another night and sticky buns to go another morning. \\n\\nBest patio on the strip hands down!  It was shaded from the sun, had a front row seat to the Bellagio fountains and misters to cool you.  The food was great.  Bacon waffles with chocolate sauce, ahi tuna burger and turkey avocado omelettes all delicious.  Only bad thing was the sticky buns, they didn't live up to the hype..a little dry. Service was great, very friendly.  Atomosphere was quiant- didn't feel like a casino restaurant at all.  Would go back in a heartbeat.\",\n",
       " 'I love this place!! \\n\\nContext: I was visiting my friend in Vegas for a couple of days and she asked me what I wanted for dinner right before my flight out. My request was simple: \"Somewhere outdoors with a view of the strip where we can chill, drink, eat some good food and people watch.\" Surprisingly, there was only one place that fit my demands: Mon Ami Gabi!\\n\\nApprehensively we drove over to Paris expecting a wait at the restaurant that would damper the plans but surprisingly most of the outdoor seating was available when we showed up at around 5:00 pm. We got a prime seat outside facing the Bellagio. Picture this: sangria, setting sun, water show, slight breeze with beautiful weather. Ah...Vegas - you gotta love it.\\n\\nWe ended up ordering the escargot (delicious) and the skate wing (kind of fishy flavored, a bit disappointing) to share. However, I gotta admit that the whole experience was not really about the food, more about the ridiculously relaxing and beautiful experience.\\n\\nSo again I say: I love love love this place. Usually when I\\'m in Vegas I\\'m just too hungover and in pain and I\\'m so glad we stopped in at Mon Ami Gabi to just stop for a second, chill, and experience the good life =)',\n",
       " 'We had lunch here with friends who were visiting. First, it was pricy...but expected, due to the strip location. The reason they get two stars is because the ambiance was lovely, service was just ok but the food quality was fairly lousy. The sangria was good as was the baguette they brought for appetizer. I ordered Quiche Lorraine (French Restaurant, right? Should be good). It was about 30 seconds from being burnt. It was so \"well-done\" the eggs were dried out. Portion was very small considering it came with about six potato chips on the side for $14 or $15. My husband ordered Macaroni Gratin. It was also dry and flavorless. He sent it back and ordered a hamburger, specified NO RAW ONIONS! It was cooked to order but raw onion on it and NO CONDIMENTS! The waiter dropped it and ran. Never came back to check on us.

About $15 a plate. There was a wait for the outdoor area so we just decided to sit inside. The food was good, in my opinion but the others I was with thought it could be better.

Hence my visit to Mon Ami Gabi this week, where I took little note of anything else on the menu and ordered this house specialty.\\n\\nAt MAG, the signature \"Steak + Frites\" bears little resemblance to its ubiquitous French namesake, as it\\'s a pounded, \"triple tenderized\" paillard of sirloin covering most of a steak platter and topped with crisp fried ribbons of potato that were difficult to eat gracefully. Amazingly, the chef managed to flash grill it to my specified \"rare\", but my steak knife really got a workout with the sinews throughout the meat. There was a tasty \"amuse bouche\" to start (with an extra serving offered by my stellar server Missy), a delicious mini-baguette that would delight most and a very nice wine list by both the glass and bottle.\\n\\nThe patio would always be my choice for dining here, weather permitting, and it\\'s heated in season.

I'm pretty sure I scraped every ounce of cheese of that dish...\\n\\nENJOY\",\n",
       " 'This was our favorite meal for our whole stay. We had a reservation and were seated within 5 minutes. The food was served quickly and was satisfying. We all got steak frites. AND the creme brulees are worth every sweet calorie.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that when we sat at the bar while waiting the bartender harshly said our 14 year old could not wait there. Where could he wait? This seems consistent in all restaurant locations and even at pool bars. If Vegas wants families, it has to figure out a way to accommodate them.',\n",
       " \"This place will forever hold a special place in my heart, not only because my husband took me here the night he proposed, but also because their food is amazing. A lovely and romantic ambiance with staff who are always on their a game. You can't go wrong with mon ami gabi. I do suggest making reservations because they get packed. The classique steak is my favorite... A delicious steak at a very reasonable price\",\n",

The hostesses were all very kind and accommodating even with 2 of our people running a little late. We luckily ended up getting a table outside with a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains.\\n\\nOur server was absolutely fantastic and helpful, and most of the staff had that great level of professionalism you expect from a high end restaurant. Everyone at the table ordered different appetizers and they were phenomenal. I had the smoked salmon which was really incredible, I highly recommend it. \\n\\nThe baked goat cheese appetizer was ginormous, as was the onion soup au gratin. \\n\\nEveryone loved their food. Seriously, their was a hush over the table as everyone savored their meals. I will say, I got the chicken paillard and was somewhat dissapointed in how dry the chicken was, so, I would not recommend that. The sauce and veggies it came with were good though. The trout amandine was delicious as well.\\n\\nOverall, it was a wonderful experience, the food and ambiance are lovely, this place is excellent for a date night or an intimate outing with friends. GO! I can't wait to try their breakfast/brunch menu.\",\n",
       " \"I'm in love with this restaurant! Food is always outstanding and so is the service! \\nMussels Meunière is always delicious! Never have a complaint and I adore the macaroni Au gratin!! Super yummy and they even give you extra French bread to take home if you'd like to, so I always do and I bring home my mussels sauce that's left over and use that as a dip for my bread at work the next day. The steak frites are good but don't try to reheat them, they just aren't the same :(\",\n",
       " \"Great food and great service. I came here last for my stepmom's birthday and everyone was happy with their food. I ordered the french onion soup and a plate of seasonal veggies. I'd like to go again to try the fruit and cheese plate!\",\n",
       " \"Bon appetitie! Mostly a steakhouse with a french flair. Menu is anglo friendly enough and yes, they have escargot to make it authentic. Entrees are varied with non beef dishes nicely done as well. Service is complete and polite, dining room is only slightly buzzy with chatter at your own table very easy and without intrusive noise from afar. Decor is rich and ambiance is strong. Prices are par for Vegas, good value compared to nonVegas venues, but no ten dollar steaks either. My salad was fresh, portions were good, food well prepared. One small gripe, the excellent baguettes are delivered with only a spreading knife to cut cut them. It's both comical and aggrevating to see the thrashing and hammering efforts that go on at each table to piece out the loaf with a totally ineffective knife. Pinching off pieces was the best fallback. Nice outdoor seating complements to comfortable dining room. Very worth of a future visit.\",\n",
       " \"I've never written reviews before but I had to for my AMAZING experience at Mon Ami Gabi. We had a reservation for 7:45 but upon arriving we requested to wait for a table outside on the patio. At the prime time for dinner on a Saturday during one of the busiest weekends in Vegas (EDC weekend) we only had to wait 15 minutes and it was definitely worth it!! We were able to watch the water show at the Bellagio all throughout our meal. \\n\\nOur server's name was Billy and he was so fun and great- a big reason why I had to write a review in hopes of him seeing it!! We started off with an order of the Jumbo Lump Crabcakes and Escargot. Best Crabcakes we've ever had. The Escargot sauce was delicious- we kept dipping our complimentary bread in it! \\n\\nFor our meals, I had the Hanger Steak and my boyfriend had the New York Strip, both with fries and Merlot sauce. We ate every last bit despite how full we were! We were celebrating my 21st birthday and to say dinner there made my day is an understatement!\",\n",

I have tried both their lunch and dinner and am happy to say that I will come back again!\\n\\nReasonably priced and amazing food.',\n",
       " \"Meeting up with friends for lunch, we stopped at Mon Ami Gabi Restaurant as it was close to another stop we were making. The other 4 were already there (coming from the Venetian) and I was on foot coming way down from the Luxor. Needless to say, I was holding up the crowd. The rest of the party could not be seated or put their name on the list until I arrived as well. When I finally did arrive, we were seated outside on the patio - which was a plus. Nice weather, good views - but the table was very small. Too small to crowd 5 people around. Inevitably, there was frequent bumping from people walking by on their way to and from their tables. \\n\\nI thought the service was a bit lower than expected. One guy came out to give everyone water. He filled up everyone's glass and when it came to mine there was only enough for 1/3 of a glass. Did he get more? No. So I drank it thinking it would be a sign to bring more - but it wasn't. We did receive two sleeves of baguettes. One saucer was filled with the olive oil for dinner and there were four other saucers for people to put their bread - except there were five of us. I had to eventually stop someone and ask for a plate. \\n\\nLooking over the menu I selected the Caesar salad. When everyone's plate was brought out everything looked so good. Another guy at our table ordered another kind of salad and it was huge - then mine came out. It was one of the smallest, most boring things I have seen ever: a few strips of lettuce, some cheese and a shard of bread - all for the nice price of $9. \\n\\nI could definitely do without a repeat visit here.\",\n",
       " 'Always delicious.  This is my 8th or 9th time at this restaurant.  It is one of my go to places in Vegas.  I go here with friends but also with clients.  Here are some of the highlights.\\n\\n1) Great service\\n2) Good and consistent food quality\\n3) Ambiance is great but keep in mind it is a cafe setting so it is a bit noisy\\n4) Reasonable pricing for Vegas center strip location\\n5) Beverage cost not blow up.  Very nice bottle of wine for $80 (VERY REASONABLE)\\n6) Fountain show at the Bellagio\\n\\nHighly recommend.',\n",
       " 'On a recommendation of a friend, and good reviews on Yelp, I decided we had to check this place out. Weeks in advance, I set a reservation through Open Table for 7:30 on a Tuesday night. \\n\\nDress code here is mostly lenient--no sleeveless shirts for the gentlemen and no swimwear for the ladies--chances aren\\'t likely that you\\'ll run into anyone from the Jersey Shore here. \\n\\nBut it is a popular place. There are two lines at the entrance. We arrived a few minutes early but stood in line anyway because it looked like it would be several minutes of waiting. And it was.  One line was for those with reservations and one line was for those without. I overheard someone in the \"without reservations\" line say there would be an hour wait for a table outside. When we got to the front, we let them know our name and reservation time and were seated immediately at a little table for two inside but facing the Fountains of Bellagio. \\n\\nWe were brought a loaf of delicious fresh, warm bread and split an order of escargot de Bourgogne for $11. My husband says the bread was probably the best he\\'d ever had and we cleaned the escargot dish to save the dishwasher some extra work.  \\n\\nMy husband ordered the trout amandine, a recommendation of the hostess that seated us.  It was a huge filet of trout prepared with a lemony dressing--light and healthy but full of flavor and a large enough serving for even my hungrier half to be content. \\n\\nI had the filet mignon with the merlot butter. It was prepared beautifully...exactly as I ordered and just the perfect flavor. \\n\\nBased on the food alone, we would absolutely return to Mon Ami Gabi.  Everything was delicious and our dinner was so reasonably priced, we were a bit surprised--$76 for an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert in a restaurant with a view on the strip. Say what?! \\n\\nIt\\'s a bit noisy in there but that seems to be par for the course in Vegas. We keep trying to find nice romantic restaurants and it seems the party environment that Vegas is doesn\\'t seem to allow for it...knowing that in advance, I\\'d still return to Mon Ami Gabi again.',\n",

Reikki Gal wanted to watch the dancing waters at the Bellagio across street so we sat at the outside café.  Dimitris was our server and did a terrific job.  We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay wine, the house made pate and the duck special (orange sauce) all delicious.  The 'house' treated to an amuse de bouche of carrots with shallot and champagne vinegar dressing which was delightful.\\n\\nWe shared a light dinner but there was plenty to eat and very enjoyable.  My wife is a nurse and quite the humanitarian.  A homeless person came by.  We had leftover duck, potato au gratin and French bread which she gave him, he was greatly appreciative and gobbled it down...best gourmet meal of his life we guessed and only meal he had that day!\\n\\nThe quality of the food is amazing and the service is flawless.

The taste was above average.\\n\\nThe main reason you'd eat here is for the LOCATION on the strip. Plenty of people watching and you're right in front of the Bellagio Fountains. It also gives you a break from the buffets. \\n\\nAlthough the place is casual, men can't wear tank tops or sleeveless shirts.

       " 'If I could give Mon Ami Gabi ten stars here, I would. I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. We chose them as the venue for our wedding reception. We booked the Private Dining Room, which can hold up to 30 people (though I would cap it at 24 as they suggest).  Here are the reasons we rate Mon Ami so highly:\\n\\n- Impeccable customer service from management - We worked with Drew to arrange our reception and Chris oversaw our event on the actual night of our wedding. From seating plan, to food allergy accommodations to media (LCD projector and screen) to every other detail...they worked with us and were proactive to make sure we did not have to change any of our desired reception plans.  They fully accommodated us with all the friendliness and sincerity that we have a good wedding.\\n\\n- Impeccable customer service from the wait staff - Elizabeth and Jonathan were the servers assigned to our reception of 22 people. Mon Ami Gabi also assigned a busser. You could tell the staff enjoyed their work. They were so pleasant and fun. They met and on so many occasions surpassed our every need during our wedding reception.  For example, they cut and boxed slices of wedding cake for our guests to take back to their rooms and even helped us pack items that came home with us. It was just so easy to work with them and a real pleasure. We tipped them far above the mandatory 20% gratuity.\\n\\n- Phenomenal food. Large portions. Our guests raved.\\n\\n- Beautiful views from the Private Dining Room.\\n\\n- Audio control. Music filters throughout the restaurant, but the staff was able to turn down the speakers directly above our room.\\n\\nWith 22 guests and the staff circulating and a screen set up, the room was a bit cramped. Also, the room was warm and unfortunately, the casino regulates the temperature not Mon Ami Gabi, But was still had the perfect reception.  I have no regrets, just so happy with the experience Mon Ami Gabi provided for our wedding.',\n",

Everything about this place is five star and above the top.\\nWe also went back for breakfast on the patio the next morning. It had a great view and once again didn't disappoint at all!!! Would highly recommend going here it's truly an amazing experience.\",\n",

You will have to wait for an outside table but we sat in the atrium which was open and sunny with a view of the action on the strip. Service was a bit slow but I would say both our waiters were experienced and professional. We watched the one deal with a difficult customer very well. I was about to tell the customer to take a hike but the waiter remained friendly with the jerk.  My wife had the waffles one day which she did not love.

For my entree, I went with the signature steak frites with the béarnaise sauce. The steak was a perfect medium rare despite being quite thin (by design, of course). The frites are like the shape (ish) of fries with the texture chips, I found them to be the perfect accompaniment to the steak. If you're in Vegas, do be sure to give Mon Ami Gabi try!\",\n",

Mon Ami Gabi is located inside the Paris Resort and Casino. \\n\\nWe were seated by the edge of the patio with view to the Bellagio fountain. Our waitress came over and introduced herself. She also gave us a few recommendations being that it was our first time and specials that were not on the menu.

I noticed that it said it was served with blueberries and warm blueberry syrup, topped with whipped cream.. well I was a bit scared. I am not a fan of blueberries being that I was always fooled as a child (blueberry pancakes are NOT the same as chocolate chips, mom!) I decided to go for it and face my fears especially since I knew already that it was going to be full of blueberries. Lemme tell you this, it was the most perfect french toast ever that I have had in a very long time. The sweetness was done to perfection, the blueberries themselves were perfect, everything about this meal was just magical and out of this world. The french toast was cooked just right. It makes me want to cry of happiness. I could eat this all day, errday and be a happy person forever! I would HIGHLY recommend this dish. I would skip out on waiting for the buffet line any day for this dish here in Vegas. Yes, yes I am in love with this french toast. \\n\\nIt was a pleasant experience and it became one of my favorite places to be at. The atmosphere, super good food and the great view made me feel like I was not in sin city. \\n\\nThey also serve lunch and dinner. I would love to come back and have a glass of wine and also try out their Steak Bordelaise, Steak Au Poivre, Creme Brulee, Duck Confit & Fingerling Potato and their Escargots De Bourgogne cause sure whyyyy not.. I love this place!!',\n",
       " \"I used to live a few blocks from the original Mon Ami Gabi on Lincoln Park West in Chicago, but I never went, only because it looked overly expensive.  However, leave it to me to dine there for the first time in Vegas.  The prices are actually very reasonable.  I had the french onion soup to start, which is almost a meal in itself.  I recommend it.  I had the steak au poivre with brandy peppercorn sauce which was decent but if I go back, I'll have to try the filet mignon with merlot butter, which is supposed to be their signature steak.  The sides were good, I recommend the garlic spinach.  They also have a pretty expansive wine list, which is a must for a french steakhouse.  The only downside was that they were out of a lot of dishes, including the dessert that we wanted!  We had an 8:15 reservation, so they shouldn't be running out of things that early on.\",\n",
       " \"Mon Ami Gabi, you do not make your food with love. Your crusty baguette, in its tres cool paper sleeve, is obviously kept under a lamp, not freshly baked. Your food is delivered to the table quickly & without any pageantry. Perhaps your steaks are spectacular (as I've been told) but I'll never know because your French onion soup is mediocre & your quiche Lorraine is overpowered by chewy bacon & lacks a buttery crust.\\n\\nYour patio is 5-stars wonderful, but can I get some quality eats to go along with my spectacular view of Las Vegas Blvd, si vous plait?\",\n",
       " \"I was waiting for a friend and stopped by for lunch here.

He joined in on our reverie~ we had an excellent table on the rim of the patio. Actually could see the dancing waters across the street. A nice little extra bonus~the food!!! Yes! I am gonna say it again EXCELLENT !! We 3 had  steaks, each a different way. Merlot sauce, maiter\\'d butter & bernaise just sooo good. Had a great cocktail a \"French Romance!\" The price point is wonderful! I live here and can\\'t wait to go back!!!',\n",

Simply delightful, all the way around - from the lovely view of the strip to the damn delicious food.\\n\\nIt became a trend for me to order multiple items off the menu when we had breakfast, so I could sample each one (probably should have stuck to buffets, since I'm so indecisive). \\n\\nI had the croissant sandwich and blueberry french toasts, and ate bits of both. I was in breakfast heaven. Seriously, I couldn't have asked for a better meal! I'll definitely be back on future trips.\",\n",

The table was dead silent as everyone attempted to keep their composure and heads up.  \\n\\nOrdered: \\n- Chicken, broccoli, and cheese crepe: Delicious!!  If my stomach wasn\\'t at odds with me, I would have finished every bit of it.  \\n- Side of fruit: I was hoping for a small bowl of fresh whole fruit but instead got a fancy diet saucer filled with cut up soggy fruit.  They could have skipped steps \"cut\" and \"drench in fruit slime.\" \\n\\nThe baguette served as a nibbler comes out in a long, warm roll.  Crumbly, soft, chewy, and fresh!\\n\\nNo swimwear.

You must try the Filet Mignon in bordelaise red wine reduction sauce. The escargot is just out of this world.  The wines are all french so of course I had no idea what I was drinking but who cares.  I like anything with Le or Les in front of it. Outside seating is very hard to come by but I don't care for outside seating much because I hate to watch drunks pass out as I'm about to eat my food.  The indoor dining area is romantic, cozy and you forget you're in the middle of the las vegas strip with people gambling all their pennies or millions away.  The dark mahagony furniture, red velvet drapes and crisp table linen sets the mood for a delightful evening.  At night though, the view of the Bellagio water show is to die for.  Just gorgeous.  The service is worth mentioning.  They're impeccably attired and all have some sort of french accent (fake I know but I just love it).  They're attentive without being intrusive.

I like my seafood crepe although it was a bit on the heavier side and it was a bit too creamy...and my friend's ham and cheese crepe was a bit too salty in my opinion. Nevertheless, the atmosphere was really relaxing and nice. I would definitely return here!\",\n",

Honestly I'd rather have the coffee from my hotel room than whatever they were serving. @ $4 is was definitely not worth it. The eggs Benedict were good. However the bacon was CHARed. I do wish I tried the Bloody Mary's though because they looked so good from across the room. The view was great.

I went for breakfast while I was in Vegas and it was so good I went for lunch the next day.\\n\\nFor breakfast I ordered the banana foster waffle and the others at my table ordered the salmon eggs benedict and the chicken, brie, and apple crepe. I really liked my waffles. Most waffles I order are soggy, but these were very crispy on the outside. It was topped by great, tasty bananas and the foster sauce. They also give you a blackberry jam and whipped cream. Those go great with the waffles. I tried the eggs benedict and liked it, even thoug I dont like eggs or salmon. It was very flavorful and tasted great. The crepe was good, but not great. I felt the chicken was a little dry, but with the brie and the apples, it was tasty. \\n\\nFor lunch I started with the hancut gaufrette potato chips and I loved it. The chips were crispy and the blue cheese dip was rich and creamy. I also ordered the steak frites classique, which came with a maitre d'hotel butter. This dish was great.  Because the waiter said that the steaks were thin, I ordered my medium rare, which was a great decision. The steak was super tender and very savory. When you melt the butter on top of the steak, it combines with the juices to create a flavorful sauce to eat with the steak. The frites were great, too. They were crispy and had the right amount of saltiness. I cleaned my whole plate because it tasted so good. \\n\\nI sat on the patio both times because the restaurant was not too crowded. It had a great view of the Bellagio. Unfortunately, I didnt get to see the water show. I would definitely reccomend the patio.\\n\\nOverall, Mon Ami Gabi was one of my best meals in Vegas. I loved everything about it and I would definetly be back.\",\n",

       " 'Went here for dinner while inn Vegas. It was ok, nothing to write home about. we had a baked scallop appetizer. Very small portion for the price. The scallops were cut in half. My wife had the steak frites and i had the duck and pork belly cassolet. they were both good, but again, not great. Ask the waiter to take our picture because it was our wedding anniversary. He was more concerned about getting the name of the restaurant in the shot that he almost cut our heads off in the picture.',\n",
       " 'The 3 stars is a push.  It was actually quite good, but the fairly poor service and bathrooms with a line-out-the-door in the casino, I had to settle at 3.  So let\\'s bullet point:\\n\\nPROS:\\n- Food.  The filet mignon was absolutely delicious, in some sort of merlot sauce.  I believe there was also the word \"reduction\" in it, which tends to add to the fancy shmancyness.  It was about $32, so me and the boyfriend split it.  It came with an interesting side - these crispy \\'fries\\' that actually tasted a lot better than they looked.\\n- Asparagus.  Infused with butter.  Nuff said.\\n- The waiter was from SD and super cool.  Definitely a surfer/stoner type, and we enjoyed his company.\\n\\nCON:\\n- There is no restroom in the actual restaurant, so have fun waiting in line with a bunch of drunk Cougars and the 20 something year olds waiting patiently on the outiside to pick out the ripest (drunkest, or bustiest, whatever was closest) one.  Kinda ruined the fancy French restuarant vibe.\\n- The poor water guy spilled water essentially all over my placing.  He was nice about it, but everything I used that night was pretty wet.\\n- Actual waiter was cool, but completely forgot that we had ordered a bottle of wine, and didn\\'t even get it until after our steaks were served.\\n\\nComplaints are minor, and food was delicious.  If you\\'re going to spend $30+ for a steak, I would neutrally recommend this place.  If that even makes sense.',\n",

A waiter spilled water and not only didn't apologize but also didnt clean it up. It's overpriced and the food is not that great. A French bistro would be not only a lot cheaper but also better!\",\n",

Bit of a problem with a strip steak that was grizzly...but our server brought a filet licktky split and wow- very impressed!\\nWatch the Bellagio water show and head over for a wonderful dinner.\",\n",
       " \"Delicious and well priced for the quality of the food and the service. It does get VERY busy so make reservations ahead of time and if you're looking for the special call ahead and reserve it or else you run the risk of them selling out.\\n\\nIt isn't upscale in dress but it doesn't hurt and PLEASE try their mac & cheese - SO GOOD.\",\n",
       " \"Mon Ami Gabi is a quaint French restaurant, located in Paris Resort and Casino. It was a bit far from the center of the strip ~10 minutes walking. The decorum of the restaurant was very cute and resembles a modern cafe in France. Casual and delicious! \\n\\nService was OK in that there seemed to be no designated waiter per table so you had to flag one down to ask for the check. However, they did refill our glasses multiple times, so I can't complain. Bottled or sparkling water are complimentary. \\n\\nI recommend coming for brunch, which is only offered on weekends. Their lunch menu is very limiting but it is still possible to pick out some interesting and tasty dishes. If you have never had escargot, I would recommend trying it at Mon Ami Gabi because it is not as slimy (which may seem revolting).\\n\\nI came here on weekday afternoon. We started with the Escargots de Bourgogne which is oven roasted snails cooked in garlic herb butter. I believe this is true, butter makes EVERYTHING tastes good. ;) I like escargot and this dish made me like it more. If I had a larger group and a bigger appetite, I would have tried more dishes from their Hors D'Oeuvres because it truly gives you a taste of authentic french cuisine. I would recommend Country Style Pâté, Chicken Liver Mousse, Sea Scallops Gratinées  and Oysters Du Jour if you're feeling adventurous.\\n\\nFor lunch, their offerings are predominantly, sandwiches, crepes, salads and steak frites (which is essentially steak with thinly cut fries).\\nFor brunch, I have heard good things about their french toast, pancakes, crepes and eggs benedicts. \\n\\nThe two of us ordered the Croque Madame and Seafood Crepe for entrees. Croque Madame was fine but the seafood crepe was show-stopper. First of all, the crepe was buttery and thin, strewn over with a béchamel cream sauce. The shrimps and scallops were fresh, tender and sweet. And the combination of textures and flavors satiated my palate. Definitely recommended!\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed Mon Ami Gabi and will come back next time for their brunch. Our check came out for ~$17 pp, which was reasonable compared to how much we ate. Also, they provide complimentary, fresh-baked french baguettes. Love!\",\n",

You will not be seated unless the majority of your party arrives.  The service is professional and seemingly friendly, but the food is \"meh.\"\\n\\nOur group ordered the gamut of items.  Some of us shared the mushroom appetizer which was a bit juvenile.  The presentation was nice, but the thick cream and mushroom combination was overwhelming.  \\n\\nWe also shared a caesar salad but, that too, was uneventful.  There were fried, cubed potatoes which was a \"psyche\" moment because I was hoping for crispy croutons to add texture and taste.\\nI also ordered the scallops which, had there not been the sliced leek accompaniment, would have been good.  \\n\\nI tried a bit of my friend\\'s bone-in rib eye.  I eat rib eye ALL THE TIME and found this preparation to be chewy and tasteless...a TOTAL disappointment especially since this is a steak frites restaurant.\\n\\nAll-in-all, I was saddened by the entire dining experience.

Yes, I tend to order the same thing every time I go to my favorite places- my favorite places have my favorite meals and I don't like to mess with that. But, my husband couldn't disagree more so  always get to try a few bites of what he gets and it's something new every time- they are all good.

Sadly the next steak was just as poor in quality despite being seasoned, well seared and cooked to the right temperature. The manager eventually appeared and apologized as you would expect. Surprisingly he then admitted knowing about a problem with their meat provider's product quality. The biggest disappointment was that they still chose to serve these steaks in the first place.

Coffee and provisions were desperately needed. We got seated on the patio by request, with a view overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio. I was on my summer vacation and ready to enjoy myself thoroughly. My Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict was spot on. Rich hollandaise sauce covered the English muffins and it was truly a remarkable experience. I am a huge fan of the coffee. (Intelligentsia coffee, I believe) It was rich, strong and flavorful. It revived us perfectly. We also shared their Blueberry Pineapple Crepes, special of the day. Came with a little boat of freshly whipped cream. They were light, sweet and scrumptious. Good for sharing. \\n\\nFor an impromptu, spur of the moment breakfast idea, this place was a 10 out of 10. Service was exemplary, waters were promptly refilled, and the restrooms are located out of the restaurant and inside the Paris casino. The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous and very French, in keeping with the theme of the hotel. They have nightly dinner specials. I think I saw Beef Wellington on the Sunday menu. In case you wanted to give that a try instead of Gordon's Beef Welly across the slot machines. His food is pretty spectacular too though, so have a go at it.

My hubby liked their baguette, but it was only served at lunch time.\\nWe love to seat outside for people watching.

       " 'We had a great departing lunch at Mon Ami Gabi this last Sunday. Mon Ami is one of my faves in town for lunch.  Not so much at night, but almost always for lunch. I love to sit in the atrium and people watch.\\n\\nWe ate and drank some truly fine French bistro food.\\n\\nT and I started with a dozen oysters. The waistress said they were most like Fanny Bays, but I thought these were smaller and sweeter.  Delish. Lots of lemon, mignonette with tons of shallots and fresh grated horseradish.\\n\\nD started with the frisee au lardon (frisee and bacon salad here in the US where they are probably afraid of the word lardons.)  Because I had this for my entree I can comment upon it. It was delicious. Poached egg, slightly warm frisee, lots of chunks of bacon. Light vinaigrette.  V good.\\n\\nFor an entree C had the Croque Monsieur, which was a little unorthodix because it was not open face. However, it had tons of cheese and ham. It was really a lovely tasty sandie.  \\n\\nT and I both drank glasses of a French Vouvray that was enormously delicious.   It had an ever so slight effervescence.  And the price was right, 9.50 on the wine list.\\n\\nI took off one star because their fries suck azz. They anger me.',\n",
       " \"Have eaten there several time and sometimes it's great and sometimes it's just okay, the atmosphere is good but for the price the food needs to be more consistant,\",\n",
       " 'It was good for what I had.  We had the escargot appetizer which was good, wife had the Skate which is a sting ray type animal.  This is very difficult to prepare and they did a great job.  I encourage either of these for anyone who considers themselves to be adventurous eaters :)',\n",
       " 'Seafood platter is perfect! Good service too',\n",
       " 'Great ambiance but the steak was very tough. The steak was pricey and so not worth it but the wine was great and the table and service very nice. I would go again, just not to order the steak.',\n",
       " 'Wow. The service was amazing and the facility was very clean. The massage was very relaxing and the staff was very considerate of individual requests and needs. I recommend eating at the lotus of Siam which is next door and world renown.',\n",
       " \"Delicious food, nice atmosphere, and your wallet won't be crying at the end of your meal!\\n\\nStarted off sharing the escargot which was delicious. I was so busy enjoying the perfectly cooked, well portioned sea scallops I didn't try any one else's dish but my family seemed to enjoy what they ordered. I'll definitely eat here again on my next trip and will try to grab a patio seat so I can enjoy a view of the Bellagio water show across the street.\",\n",
       " \"My favorite restaurant so far at The Paris Las Vegas. Sooooooo yummy. For breakfast, the Grapefruit with Crystallized Ginger is refreshing and light - I'd been eating waaaay too much over the last couple days,  so this was a welcome change. (Of course, I ordered it with a side of yummy bacon... It came out thick cut and Glazed with maple. Nom.) \\n\\nFor dinner one night,  I sat at the bar and ordered the Mussels and a glass of Pinot. It was the best.\",\n",
       " \"I gave this place 3 stars based on the following:\\n- their french onion soup is delicious and one of my favorites\\n- i hate to say this but... Left Bank and Costco make a juicier and flavorful roast chicken... ours was so dry it could mop up the glass of wine we spilled.  hahaha.\\n- they served a box of popcorn to each table. what the hell???  so weird.  i didn't get it.  does anyone know the logic behind this?\\n- be specific about where you'd like to sit, otherwise they'll put you in a random spot with the foot traffic of waitstaff and patrons circling around you like a swarm of bees.  i prefer the solarium-type room or patio seating to the dark, cavelike atmosphere of the interior rooms.\\n- hostesses are pretentious (this is pretty funny)\\n- the waitstaff are pleasant.\\n- it's a fun place to have a meal and watch the fountain show at Bellagio.\\n- again, the french onion soup is quite tasty.  :)\\n- these guys close waaaay to early.\",\n",
       " \"I went here for brunch this afternoon with my fiancé. We had been meaning to go here forever but as locals we don't like going to the strip often. I was in the mood for a croque madame so we decided to finally venture to Mon Ami Gabi. \\nWe chose to sit on the patio because it has a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and also is just a great people watching spot. There was no wait although the restaurant was quite busy. \\nThere were misters in the patio to keep us cool as well as umbrellas, I ordered a mimosa and my fiancé ordered a Bloody Mary. The mimosa was delicious, and the Bloody Mary my fiancé came back with from the DIY bloody bar encouraged me to order one as well. \\nWe began our meals with chicken liver pâté and a smoked salmon plate. The pâté was very rich but delicious and the smoked salmon was divine. I ended up eating just the salmon and capers as the toasts it was served with began to fill me up a bit. \\nAfter our appetizers we got a Croque Madame with frites. The Gruyere on the Madame was so delicious and the sunny side up egg soaked into the bread perfectly. all I could hear were angels singing. The frites were crispy and had just the right amount of salt. \\nIt was a delicious French brunch, I would say it's family friendly restaurant as long as your children are well behaved.\",\n",
       " 'Great Vegas Pick. Great menu and wine list, perfect location overlooking the Bellagio Water show, and awesome service. Butter Lettuce Salad was simple and good, Steak and Frites were Trs dlicieux. Fun, romantic and would definitley come back.',\n",
       " \"We sat outside on a beautiful Vegas night, it was a bit windy so we didn't get to watch the fountains at Bellagio. The server was very attentive. Our food arrived extremely fast. The filet mignon with Merlot butter was delicious.\",\n",
       " \"This review is for their brunch menu! Came here around 1PM and requested to get seated outside the patio so we can enjoy the Bellagio water show. \\n\\nWe ordered:\\nEggs Benedict: My fave! Every time I come to Vegas, I have to get their eggs benedict, it is so delicious! \\nSeafood Platter: Pretty good. A good amount of fresh seafood. It doesn't beat the Bay Area seafood, but still decent. The ceviche was my favorite. \\nEscargot: YUM! Very saucy and smelled so good, tasted even better with garlic inside.\\nFrench Onion Soup: Pretty good, kind of salty, but I love the cheese they use!\\n\\nOverall, I love this place and I come every time I am in Vegas!\",\n",
       " \"I came in expecting a bit more, the general atmosphere was nice and the wait staff was prompt and courteous but overall the food was a let down.\\n\\nThe bread was very good but everything after that was too salty. My girlfriend and I ordered the Butternut Squash soup, Duck Confit, Full order of mussels, and the Skate Wing. Our appetizers took a little too long to come out but our waiter kept us updated and was nice about it.\\n\\nButternut Squash- rich and creamy with bits of ham and spinach, it would have been delicious if it wasn't so salty! After about two spoonfuls it felt like you were licking salt.\\n\\nDuck Confit- pretty good portion and the overall taste was decent but the fat was not rendered out so there was huge chunks of fat where it should have been crispy skin.\\n\\nFull Order of Mussels- Lots of plump mussels in a tasty broth with onion. not too bad as well, I can see why people recommend ordering the full order as it comes with delicious skinny frites. Again it has the same problem as the Butter Nut Squash soup in that it the broth was much too salty.\\n\\nSkate Wing- Crispy and flaky. I really wanted to love this dish, the mushrooms and red sauce on top was delicious and the first few bites were heaven for me. But towards the end of the fish I could feel the crunch of salt crystals and I couldn't even finish it. The mashed potatoes were also forgettable.\\n\\nThe overall bill wasn't terrible for the amount of dishes we got but honestly I think we will go somewhere else next time to get our French Bistro fix.\",\n",
       " 'I love love love this fancy little French bistro. I\\'ve sat inside before which has a nice, dimly-lit, and intimate atmosphere when you don\\'t mind a little bit of surrounding noise from other tables. The best seating though is on the patio where you get a nice view of the Bellagio fountains and just a splendid ambiance overall. \\n\\nThe bread basket is delicious. I think the bread they serve is one of the most important determining factors as to whether or not you will get a great meal. I have tried the Escargots de bourgogne. I wasn\\'t sure how I\\'d feel about it, but it was actually really good! It was seasoned with garlic-herb butter. For dinner I had the Steak au poivre. It was nothing less than amazing. \\n\\nTo pair with dinner I ordered their french sangria, known as \"Frangria\" which is absolutely divine. I wasn\\'t able to try out their dessert so that is something I\\'ll have to look into on my next visit. I am also really looking forward to trying out their breakfast meals after hearing great things about it. It is a good spot to take friends and also have a nice romantic dinner out with your significant other.',\n",
       " \"Went here for an early 5 PM dinner before a 7 PM show. Got seated right away and got to sit on the patio...on a Friday night. That was exciting. The service was great. We both ordered dirty martinis with blue cheese olives which were delicious. We ordered the escargot and warm brie for appetizers. The escargot is buttery, cheesy delicious! I recommend it! The warm brie was good, but the escargot was the highlight. My husband ordered the filet with merlot sauce. It was delicious and cooked perfectly. I had the endive salad which was actually a quite beautiful presentation and tasted delicious as well. For desert we had the creme brulee which was as good as I've had in a while. Overall we were very happy with this place, we had a delicious dinner, made it to our show in plenty of time, sat outside and watched the 'interesting' people on the strip...all for about $130.00. With the way that most restaurants over charge in Vegas, especially on the strip, this was a great place for a great price. We will be back!\",\n",
       " \"Not sure what else can be said that hasn't already! I took my 22 year old son and his girlfriend here for dinner in September, and they LOVED their meals. Great atmosphere and wonderful service. We had a reservation and were seated on time. It was very crowded, lots of people waiting outside.\",\n",
       " 'I hate writing reviews about Strip restaurants because I\\'m just 1 out of a 1000 reviews. But I felt strongly enough about my last visit to waste some time venting here. \\n\\n7:30am on a brisk Saturday morning, I found myself crossing town on the way home from a night of a carousing. As I\\'ve been known to do on such nights, I decided it would be a fine time to indulge in a nice breakfast. Being that the weather was particularly tolerable for February, I decided to bask in it & dine on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi. I\\'ve enjoyed my similar visits in the past. Sure, the food isn\\'t as good as Bouchon, but while it\\'s not cheap, it\\'s not quite as expensive, and the smoking-friendly patio has been enough to make up for any culinary shortcomings. So what happens when you disturb that equation? As it turns out, those pluses aren\\'t strong enough to carry the place.\\n\\nThere were two things in particular that chapped my ass. Firstly, there was the construction team out working or surveying or whatever on the patio. I got there pretty close to opening, and hey, the works gotta get done sometime. But the incessant pacing back & forth, discussion, and ladder-arranging turned out to be disturbing enough to aggravate my otherwise saintly patience. Being that I\\'m such a nice guy, by the time I\\'d had enough the place started filling up, so the construction team was forced out by necessity, so I never had to speak up. I was distracted enough by everything that I didn\\'t notice how filthy my water glass was. I\\'m not the kind of guy to bitch about things like that, but it was bad enough that I didn\\'t feel out of place for asking for another glass. I explained what happened to the waiter, and he quickly replaced my glass. I continued on with my meal, and as I was done I picked up my water to find that the new one was just as bad as the first. Now, you would think that when someone - right or wrong - brings up a complaint like that the staff would spend the extra 30 seconds it would take to find the shiniest glass in the rack. Not at Mon Ami Gabi! By this point I was done eating, so I decided to just mention it to the waitress when she asked how everything was. Well, that opportunity never presented itself (which is a problem unto itself in my opinion). \\n\\nAm I nitpicking? Maybe. But Mon Ami Gabi is by no means cheap, and their food is not so spectacular that it makes up for everything else. And sure, breakfast is considered a \"lesser\" meal at places like this, but that doesn\\'t mean they get a pass on anything that happens before noon. A year ago this would\\'ve given them a 4 star review. Maybe I\\'ll try again and see if I caught them on an off day.',\n",
       " 'We dined at Mon Ami Gabi with a group of 20 and were seated rather quickly at two different tables. Our drink orders were taken quickly but we were sitting for half an hour before the waitress took our food order. My recommendations for appetizer is the chicken patte. The salmon was too peppery for my taste but once you remove the chunks of pepper, the fish was great. Everyone was happy with their meals and for LV, the price is right. This place is super busy and if you do not make reservations, expect to wait 2 hours on a Saturday.',\n",
       " \"Had lunch at Mon Ami Gabi on a Friday afternoon around 12:30.  Never thought we would need a reservation as it was not a big Vegas (4th of July, Memorial Day, New Years, etc) weekend, but there was a wait.  They said it would be less than 15 minutes and they were right.  So, it wasn't horrible.  The weather was great so we decided to sit on the patio, but be advised, it's CROWDED out there.  They really cram you in.  \\n\\nWe shared the chicken liver pate, escargots and oysters for appetizers.  The winner for me was the chicken liver pate.  Velvety and rich, but not overly so.  I will say, I don't think they serve enough crustinis with it, so I recommend you either order more or immediately ask for more from your server.  We got more bread very quickly, service was spot on.  The escargots were cooked well, tender and flavorful.  The garlic herb butter they serve them in is fantastic.  The oysters were solid, nothing to write home about.\\n\\nTo eat, I had the prime steak sandwich.  The horseradish cream left something to be desired, not nearly as much heat as I expected from a horseradish dish.  The steak was not thinly sliced which made it more difficult to eat.  It also needed more seasoning.\\n\\nOverall, it was a good, but not spectacular meal.  I would return, but may sit at the bar or inside.\",\n",
       " 'All I can say is \"Wow!\"\\nOf course, $74 plus tip plus valet for breakfast for 2 should create a lot of Wow. And it did.\\nSeems even for breakfast, reservations a must.\\nWould have given it 5 stars but the walk from valet to the restaurant was a bit tiresome. Still, that\\'s what one ought to expect in Las Vegas. At least we didn\\'t have to walk through the casino to get to the restaurant.\\nWe went to Bouchon for dinner, and I have a feeling Mon Ami Gabi would compare favorably.',\n",
       " 'My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas! I have been here twice for dinner and once for lunch.\\n\\nBread comes with butter and a carrot topping. very interesting but good.\\nThe scallops and french onion soup is to die for!\\nFilet mignon melts in your mouth like butter.\\nAlso, if you sit outside, you can watch the Bellagio Fountains.\\nOut of all the fine dining places I have tried in Vegas, this one is still my favorite. The food is great and it is also cheaper than most other places.',\n",
       " 'Wanted to get out of the casino/conference center for some fresh air.  Walked here and had an excellent breakfast with 2 colleagues. I highly recommend it.',\n",
       " 'I wish I could dine here every day!  Such a French experience.  Wonderful food, wine, and service.  Just some bread, pâté, and a glass of wine is heaven. Everything else we had was delicious.',\n",
       " 'Yikes! My mom and I go here every year when we are in town for business. It\\'s usually a lovely experience. This last time, however, it was anything but. Made reservations and were there right on time. When we arrived we were told to wait in the \"reservation line.\" Never heard of THAT in my entire life. Waited for about 40 minutes because it just so happened to be Valentine\\'s Day and everywhere else would have been booked up. After waiting forEVER (keep in mind I am super pregnant and achy) we were finally seated. After complaining to the waitress the manager came over and made a million excuses without ever apologizing.\\nAnd after all that...the food was OKAY.\\n\\nBad experience and terrible customer service. Very disappointed. Used to be a regular spot for us.',\n",
       " 'This was my favorite meal last visit to Vegas. Had the flat iron steak with the bordelaise sauce and french onion soup. Will be back.',\n",
