# CDS: NLP Research Team

## Introduction
We are a student-led research team from [Cornell Data Science ](https://datascience.engineering.cornell.edu/index.html)(CDS), working on Natural Language Processing projects under [Prof. Thorsten Joachims](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/). This semester, we are participating in the [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge). You can visit the subteam folders to see our individual work.

* [**Neural Style Transfer For Text**](/dl-style-transfer)   
  We are seeking to modify the neural style transfer algorithm proposed by [Gatys et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) to make it applicable to text. Our goal is to devise an algorithm that is able to transfer the writing style of one review onto the content of another.
