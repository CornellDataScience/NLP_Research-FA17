# CDS: NLP Research Team

## Introduction
We are a student-led research team from [Cornell Data Science ](https://datascience.engineering.cornell.edu/index.html)(CDS), working on Natural Language Processing projects under [Prof. Thorsten Joachims](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/). This semester, we are participating in the [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge). You can visit the subteam folders to see our individual work.

## Subteams

* [**Extracting Rating Dimensions with Text Reviews**](/latent_variable)    
   **Members:** Xuwen Shen (STAT '18), Xinzhe Yang (CS '20)   
   The goal for the project is to create a recommendation system which recommends restaurants to a specific user given the user's preference and the restaurants' rating with respect to the user's preference.
   
* [**Improving Star Rating as Trend-Aware Performance Metrics**](/topic_over_time)     
  **Members:** Kenta Takatsu (CS '19), Caroline Chang (CS '20)   
  (blurb)    

* [**Local Elites in Yelp**](/local-elites)   
  **Members:** Brandon Kates (BTRY '19), Brian Cheang (CS '20)     
  The objective of the project is to build and combine two models (Local Expert Identifier / Topical Expert Identifier) for the purpose of identifying 'experts' among yelp users.  

* [**Neural Style Transfer For Text**](/dl-style-transfer)   
  **Members:** Luca Leeser (INFO '18), Yuji Akimoto (ORIE '19), Ryan Butler (CS '19), Cameron Ibrahim (ORIE '20)   
  We are seeking to modify the neural style transfer algorithm proposed by [Gatys et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) to make it applicable to text. Our goal is to devise an algorithm that is able to transfer the writing style of one review onto the content of another.
