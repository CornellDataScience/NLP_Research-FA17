The location of this hotel and very decent price makes this an amazing deal. When you walk out the front door Scott Monument and Princes street are right in front of you, Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile is a 2 minute walk via a close right around the corner, and there are so many hidden gems nearby including Calton Hill and the newly opened Arches that made this location incredible.\n\nThe hotel itself was also very nice with a reasonably priced bar, very considerate staff, and small but comfortable rooms with excellent bathrooms and showers. Only two minor complaints are no telephones in room for room service (not a huge deal for us) and no AC in the room, but they have huge windows which can be fully opened. The staff were incredible though, letting us borrow umbrellas for the rain, giving us maps and directions, and also when we had lost our only UK adapter for charging our phones gave us a very fancy one for free.\n\nI would highly recommend this hotel to friends, and when I return to Edinburgh (which I most definitely will) I will be staying here without any hesitation.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Von diesem hier waren wir nach dem überraschend positiven Erlebnis im Motel One an der Princes Street [1] etwas enttäuscht.\n\nDas Hotel ist wesentlich größer und extrem unübersichtlich. Da man auf der fünften Etage noch Teile eines weiteren Gebäude, das mittels einer Glasbrücke mit dem Hauptgebäude verbunden ist, hinzugenommen hat, kann die Suche nach dem Zimmer insbesondere auf dieser Etage zu einem Gang im Labyrinth ausarten. Habe ich so noch in keinem Hotel erlebt - uns begegneten immer wieder Menschen, die sich auf der Suche nach ihren Zimmern verirrt haben.\nUnser Zimmer war ähnlich aufgebaut wie das Zimmer im Motel One Princes Street - befand sich jedoch im Inneren des Gebäudes und hatte daher kein Fenster. Nur eine kleine Dachluke, die sich am oberen Ende eines etwa 3m langen Schachts befand, sorgte für einen minimalen Anteil Tageslicht im Zimmer. diese Luke ließ sich auch nicht öffnen, nur ein elektrisches Rollo ließ sich mittels eines Schalters öffnen bzw. schließen.\nSonst gilt für das Zimmer eigentlich das Gleiche wie für das Zimmer im im Motel One Princes Street: Relativ klein, trotzdem extrem ansprechend und schick gestaltet und clever durchdacht. Dazu sehr ruhig.\n\nIm gesamten Hotel gibt es kostenloses WLAN für die Dauer des Aufenthalts für maximal 3 Geräte.\n\nDie Lage des Motel One Royal Mile ist großartig. Vom Airlink-Flughafenbus kann man quasi in den Hoteleingang stolpern, es sind maximal 50m. Zur Royal Mile sind es etwa 100m Luftlinie (bergauf) und man benötigt etwa 5 Minuten bis dort.\n\nDas Frühstück für 9,50 GBP \/ Person kann man nutzen - muss man aber nicht. Es ist eher übersichtlich und kontinetaler Prägung, trotzdem aber sehr gut. Für den gleichen Preis oder weniger bekommt man aber problemlos ein reichhaltiges Frühstück in einem der zahlreichen Cafes von Edinburgh.\n\nFür ein oder zwei Nächte kann man hier problemlos bleiben, sollte aber nicht allzuviel erwarten. Hat man die Wahl, sollte man meiner Erfahrung nach lieber auf das andere Motel One an der Princes Street ausweichen. \n\n\n----\n[1] http:\/\/www.yelp.de\/biz\/motel-one-edinburgh-2?hrid=7UDwl3s_DuOokkGPZXZgBw","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This chain is spreading fast over there and they're bringing their efficiency and attention to detail with them here. \n\nMotel One is, as the name suggests, aimed at the budget market. Rates for this venue range from approximately £69\/night up. I booked ahead and appreciated the completely free reservation process with room guaranteed until 6pm on the day of arrival. If you give your credit card details, it's reserved beyond that time.\n\nLocation is excellent! If you exit from the Market St side of Waverly and turn right it's maybe 3 minutes away. It would be very hard to have it closer. That also makes it very close to the castle and Princes St. Welcome was warm and check-in easy. The lobby area is pretty small but clean and cosy with sweets, maps etc. There's a bar area down a few steps where they also serve the buffet breakfast each morning.\n\nMy room was the cheapest version and was internal, facing onto a courtyard. It had no view and was quite dark, but quiet. Everything was completely spotless. The bathroom was small but well designed and had a great shower. Bed was comfy with 2 single duvets. So continental, don't you know? I appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities (I'm like a beast without them), the decent sized TV and the free wifi. The hanging storage facilities are limited but it was fine for a few days. \n\nRandom: hands down the best hotel hairdryer I have ever used.

One of her brothers friends used to be a manager of one in Colorado too.  Tonight we decided to try it out.\n\nI placed my order online.  Easy process.  My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken\/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers.  Total for everything was $24.80 after tax.  I drove down and picked up my food.  The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too!   Here is how everything tasted.....................\n\nChicken Lo Mein-  Only had a little of this.  Good noodles, good white meat chicken.  My wife liked it.\n\nSesame Chicken\/Steak-  I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat.  They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item.  I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra).  This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds.  It was just alright.  The flavors didn't really do much for me.  It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland.  I had some pieces of steak\/chicken that were a bit funky too.  I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-).  The fried rice was good!\n\nEgg Roll- Eh.  It was an egg roll.  Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine.  It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty.  Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc.\n\nDeep Fried Pot Stickers-  I got 2 of these things.  They were good.  Small but good.  Straight pork filling in the middle of them.  \n\nOverall it was just alright.  I will say that they give you a GRIP of food.  The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people.  For $24.80 it was a great value.  The food just wasn't the type of thing that  you would ever crave and keep you coming back though.  While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead.  It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there.  I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like.

Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers. \n\nWith Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?","useful":8,"funny":4,"cool":6}

There's a long and interesting story surrounding Pei Wei and that of PF Changs. Let me just say that, a man named Paul Fleming (PF) and (Flemings) is responsible for many of the restaurants that you and I frequent. His ex wife and him went through a bitter divorce her nickname is (Flow) and she operates \"Flows,\" Chinese restaurants. Flow is Chinese and married another Caucasian man 20-25 years younger than her, who speaks fluent Chinese. Anyways, Peiwei's in my opinion is overpriced for the small amount of you receive for the consideration you give. In other words, there's no value for your consideration. Yes, I do enjoy the PeiWei Spicy chicken, extra spicy with water chestnuts, but at $12.53 for the water chestnuts and extra chicken, it's just not worth it. The rice is almost always dry and is cooked incorrectly in massive amounts, as well as being a long grain, not short grain rice. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":3}

The crab wontons are usually a sure bet at any Asian restaurant but for some reason it just always sucks ass here. Fishy weird taste that's contrary to what they should taste like and the sauce is garbage. Teriyaki Chicken was bland and shitty. Pei Wei Spicy dish was average at best only cuz of the sweet sugary sauce that masks the overall flavor. Now my girlfriend and I just feel like shit.. Why? Cuz it's shitty food. Also saw on the local news that the location on Glendale and 7th st. had 4 health code violations. I'm officially done with this place.

The latter was pretty good, though I found the enchilada a little perplexing.  It was hiding under the sauce and I couldn't really tell what was in it.    \n\nThe chips and salsa were great, though.  And hot.  The one person at our table who can apparently drink tabasco sauce straight even admitted his eyes were watering a little.  Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their meals.  \n\nI'm not in Ohio much, but I'd happily go back and try something else.  Oh, and um, I wouldn't exactly object to painting my living room lime green, after seeing how cool it looked at Don's.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Spinach salad came nicely dressed though the dressing was plain could have used more tartness. I had a few slight issues with the steak frites, the steak came closer to medium when medium rare was requested and was under seasoned. My accompaniment of frites (which were wonderful btw) on the other hand was too liberally salted with kosher salt so I guess I got the best of both worlds! The Bearnaise sauce sauce on the side was so-so and didn't do too much to perk up the steak.

(one thing has nothing to do with the other should you be saying to yourself something along the lines of \"well then what the hell is he complaining about\").\n\nthe vegetables that came on separate plates alongside the sandwiches were  4 dollars each.  we had three kinds.  one was sweet potatoes dressed with chilies, toasted coriander, mint and olive oil.  another was called farro, an ancient tuscan grain dressed with extra virgin olive oil, cucumber, carrot, and fine herbs. and the last one was chickpea salad with celery, pickled red onions, rosemary, parsley and lemon.\n\ni enjoyed all of them, but they were honestly not representative of their ingredients.  i dont need to have my dishes overpowered by their listed ingredients, but if something says its going to be flavoured by mint, fine herbs and lemon dont you think you should be able to experience that as you taste it?  i think so.  again, to reiterate, i didnt mind the natural taste of the vegetable offered, but if thats the way it will end up tasting, perhaps you should say so.\n\nall my peeves aside, i am still interested in trying this place out for dinner; the feel of the place is great, cool and relaxing and as i looked at their dinner menu it looked quite tasty.  so perhaps once they get their groove on itll be more enjoyable.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The host and the servers are not snobby and seem fairly friendly in this Leslieville establishment. The patrons are mixed with both young and hip city dwellers along with older more experienced foodies dining out with other couples of the same.\n\nI found myself here ordering the much touted \"Hot Balls\" but found it just okay. The only hot ball that really stood out was the Goat Cheese with a honey like dipping sauce. It was actually a pretty amazing piece of creation. The other appetizer we have were the \"Diver Scallops\" which were cooked to perfection and came with a side of really thick and salty bacon. Our mains were the \"Leg of Lamb\" and \"Wild Stripped Bass\" both were great entrees that did not disappoint but at the same time didn't have a great WOW factor.  Desert was a bit of a disappointment, not much of a variety, you had a choice between chocolate, chocolate, or chocolate in some form or another. We had the homemade chocolate cheesecake, which really didn't amount to much for my taste buds. \n\nThe Wine list is very French and if you're going by the bottle they don't really have an inexpensive alternative. Every bottle is $50+ which can make for a very expensive meal. \n\nOverall the food experience was just okay with some ups and downs. But the real down of the night was the service, after sitting down to our table , it took literally 10 min for someone to show up to greet us and take our drink orders. The other downside of the service, they don't place the wine bottles at your table but at a communal table in the centre of the room, they're suppose to pour for you but I found that our server kept forgetting even when our wine glasses were empty. I had to reach over to this communal table to grab our own bottle of wine and pour every time which really kills the experience.\n\nI hope this was just an isolated experience for us as I think this restaurant is a real gem in the Leslieville area. If you do decide to go, make sure you have reservations as the restaurant seems to get filled up in all hours of the night.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

My DC had the Farmer's Breakfast, with a hard boiled egg in this deep fried batter, with an assortment of Ontario and Quebec cheeses (including a yummy Brie), pate, and tiny pickles.

Benefit of the doubt moment: it was after 8 pm on a Sunday -- which in Toronto means you're lucky if anything half-decent is open at all -- and the place seemed  understaffed. \n\nStill, having to stand awkwardly for 10-15 min in the non-foyer, while  waiters whisked by us was not too pleasant.\n\nAnd once we had a table, service continued to be spotty. Our waiter was friendly and self-effacing, calling us his \"little neglected table.\" This was not inaccurate as even getting our initially requested waters (it was sweaty out!) took nearly 10 minutes, and later he left us with dessert menus for 20 minutes before coming back to see what we wanted, our appetites for anything sweet having seriously waned.\n\nFood-wise though, things were great. We weren't terribly hungry, and so avoided the table d'hote fixed price menu going with the \"shared food\" section on the left column of the menu. It's a limited selection here, and we ordered about half of the available items, and were not disappointed. \n\nRich white polenta, brought out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by an aproned chef who ladled a \"sugo\" of veal, zucchini and fresh basil on top. It was heart-warming, subtle and delicious, as well as a generous portion for two to share.\n\nAlongside the polenta we had two smallish ramekins. One contained \"sauce & balls\" a cheekily named but very tasty take on classic meatballs in tomato sauce. The other had what was possibly my favourite dish of the night, a simple roasted beet preparation with blue cheese. The multicoloured heirloom beets were \"al dente\" but tender and went amazingly well with the semi-melted cheese.\n\nWines were great as well. My glass of Rollegrosse red ($11) was smooth beyond even the menu description, and my companion's \"Anna 6\" white was very dry and very refreshing. \n\nIn addition to the service problems, my one other issue was the post-prandial whiskey, a single malt ($13) that came in a far-too large glass (we were informed the kitchen was \"out\" of snifters...) and which I found harsh and not to my liking. But that could be a matter of taste.\n\nTotal cost of meal for two: $77 + tip.\nThis would increase to over $100 easily if you go with the $30 table d'hote option + drinks.\n\nI would happily give this place another shot, hopefully on day where service was at full steam. Until then I can't give it more than three stars out of five.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Yes.\n\nIs that enough for me to give it five stars? No.\n\nI've been twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. On both occasions my meals were delicious, fresh and expertly prepared and presented. Wine and coffee top notch also! Yet, I still left hungry, and somewhat frustrated.\n\nWhy? The portion sizes at Table 17 are just too small, even for the average appetite. Add in frankly exorbitant costs, and it becomes clear that this place just ... well, just could be so much better. My French toast for brunch was served with about five berries -not even a salad - and must have amounted to about three slices of bread in total. $10 before tax.\n\nThe dinner menu was infuriating in its unnecessary pretentiousness. It took me about five readings of the menu to actually understand what was on offer. Less of the fancy culinary jargon and arbitrary French\/Italian synonyms for basic food items, please. My chicken mushroom tagliatelle was flawless as it was - was there really any need to describe it as \"Hen of the woods (is that the new word for chicken?!) hedgehog mushrooms, with tarragon beurre fondue\"?! \n\nAgain I must reiterate the pricing. Two mains, one shared side and a glass of wine came to $70. \n\nThankfully, the friendly service and general lively ambiance is spared the unnecessary pretensions of the menu. And if the food continues to be mouth-wateringly delicious (and trust me, it is), then I can't see why I wouldn't return to Table 17, for a special occasion. \n\nThis restaurant could be a true five-star establishment, if only it had bigger portions and a more down-to-earth, straightforward menu, that would allow the world-class food to speak for itself.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1}

Would definitely go again. On the pricier side for the neighbourhood, but nothing ridiculous. Remember to make a reservation.\n\nWent to Table 17 for dinner last night. My dinner date and I stupidly didn't think to make a reservation at 7:15 on a Saturday night (dumb, I know). So I definitely recommend a reservation. He had been to Table 17 before, I had not. Of course there were no tables when we arrived, but the staff were more than happy to seat us at the bar, which was thankfully empty when we arrived. Usually not a fan of having a nice dinner at the bar, but the barman managed to do a good job of staying out of our face, but being attentive at the same time. Of course the seat wasn't the comfiest, but that was our fault.\n\nFood:\nThe server\/ bartender made sure we knew all the daily specials and even recommended a few and took our drink orders (just beer). He also brought us a basket of bread, though it almost wasn't necessary because our appetizer came quickly.\n\nTo start we shared a Buffalo Mozzarella salad (arugula) with spiced pumpkin puree and honeycomb - yum! My date wasn't too sure about the honey at first, but actually really liked it, was a nice flavour with the mozzarella. The warm pumpkin  with the cheese was my fave part - so delish. \n\nFor my main I chose the pasta. It was capellini (I think, can't quite recall)...with gorgonzola cheese, roasted hazelnuts and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few ingredients. It was awesome - great mix of flavours and the pasta was cooked perfectly and served hot. I was skeptical about the hazelnuts at first but they were a great compliment to the gorgonzola. The portion was pretty big for this type of place, so my date had a bit of my pasta too and he also thought it was yum.\n\nMy date had the beef short ribs and said they were excellent and that the meat was falling off the bone. (As someone who does not eat beef or pork I was assured this was a good thing ha). It came with root vegetables and parsnip puree. Just as we were digging in our server brought a little bowl with extra root vegetables because the chef had suddenly realized my date didn't get enough. Once he pointed it out we realized there were only like 3 mini veggie cubes in his dish so it was nice that the staff noticed before we even did. \n\nWe contemplated getting dessert for a minute, but were pretty stuffed. Maybe next time I'd skip the appetizer and try a dessert.\n\nOnly main downfall was sitting at the bar, it's not the comfiest to sit on a stool and it felt a bit crowded when other patrons were seated at the bar. It was also a little chilly\/breezy as it's near the door and it was cold out. But that was our own fault.\n\nNot sure what the total bill was in the end for the 2 drinks, appetizer and two mains, but our mains were around $20-25, some on the menu were a little pricier.\n\nOverall great food, good service, cute place, fairly priced (though pricier than some of the other places in the neighbourhood). Definitely recommend.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I couldn't get over how much personality the restaurant has, especially considering how new it is. \n\nAnd obviously its age has no affected its popularity. The place was packed at about 1 pm on a saturday. But considering how tasty the food was, I was surprised how busy it was. I ordered a mimosa and the toritilla - a sort of spanish-style dish that takes eggs, potatoes, cheese and bakes it into some quiche-type thing. It was served with a fresh tomato dip and some greens and it was absolutely delicious. I also sampled my boyfriends cheese plater, toasts with a variety of cheese and fruit, and it was also very tasty. \n\nMaybe it's because it's new, but the service was the one thing that didn't make this a 5 star occasion.

That's a tall order to fill and sets the standards high.\n\nI wasn't a fan of Table 17 back then and I'm not surprised that my most recent dining experience was no different.  It satisfies the former part of the claim (being a neighbourhood hangout) but is far from being a culinary destination.\n\nThe kitchen seems to work along at its own pace which errs on the side of slow while servers try their hardest to service the two-roomed restaurant.  While I wouldn't say they're under-staffed I often found myself turning my head in all directions to flag our server down.\n\nA meal at Table 17 errs on the side of pricey and while I have had many expensive meals in my lifetime as a food blogger; this one definitely errs on the side of overrated.\n\nI've always lived by the mantra that if a restaurant's bread was not up to snuff that it would be an omen of the meal to follow.  Such was the case with the baguette sloppily appearing at our table; one has to ask for the communal balsamic vinegar and olive oil bottles because the servers can't be bothered to offer it.\n\n\nOysters come with a trio of condiments;  two mignonettes and the standard horseradish.\n\nWe opt for the halibut ceviche which, with its pretty plating is a disappointment as it turns out to be bland and flavorless.  The saving grace are the pea shoots, flavored with a peanut, chili and lime vinaigrette that is stellar and full-flavored.  I would happily eat a plate full of that as an appetizer.\n\nFor our mains we settle on an Ontario leg of lamb; which came deboned and served atop a bed of fava beans, roasted spring onion and butter poached black trumpet mushrooms.   Our table of 3 simultaneously shared a single thought - where's the rest of it?  To add insult to injury, the lamb was lukewarm (and the reason was in no way attributed to my occupational hazard of photographing the dish).\n\nThe Lake Erie pickerel is equally disappointing as we begin to pick at our food by this point.  The radish fennel & grapefruit \"salad\" which to me resembles more of a slaw is bland and lacking oomph.\n\nOur dinner suddenly finds salvation in the Spaghetti Al Anatra; its texture loosely reminding me of ramen cooked to a perfect al dente as the duck confit does its magic at flavoring the dish.  The crispy duck skin is a little scant but we happily devour the noodles.\n\nSide dishes are available à la carte and we opt for the sautéed kale.  It's nothing to write home about but gives us our daily dose of vegetables.\n\nAs with most things, what goes up must come down and in aviation-speak our dinner had a hard landing.  A dark chocolate torte that was reminiscent of a two-bite brownie drizzled in cheap store-bought chocolate sauce with some berries thrown on top.  The Panna-Colada was equally pedestrian as it loosely resembled those cheap complimentary desserts you'd get at the end of a Chinese dinner - all gelatin and not much else.\n\nThe message at the end of the day is - don't let the appearances at Table 17 fool you.  While everything looks great from the outside, the experience lacks substance.\n\nOur meal with 2 glasses of wine and 3 coffees came just shy of $300.  Suffice it to say, this will be the last time I dine at Table 17.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I found myself there late last night where I met up with an old friend for dinner. I have been wanting to go there for a while so when I found myself on the eastern side of the city dealing with a late day work issue I seized the opportunity. \n\nI can't say all that much about the decor as we sat on the side western side of the restaurant right by the door (in all fairness, we just walked in and had no res so we knew it would be hit or miss). The other side of the restaurant, from what I could see, looked lovely and it appears that they have one of those large chef's tables as well. \n\nSpecials of the day included an unusual app of deep fried Zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta (3 on a plate). The waiter explained that these flowers were only available for about two weeks of the year and it was a very special menu addition. The main menu is not that large with approx. half the mains being some sort of fish (arctic chair, salmon, halibut, scallops). \n\nWe started with the charcuterie board because I wanted to compare it with the charcuterie board that my fellow yelper, Deanna and I shared at Swirl the day before. The bread they served was very unusual, some sort of blueberry bread with walnuts in it. Very fresh but very heavy. The board consisted of four different types of meats, a small terrine of chicken pate, a couple of dried figs with walnuts shoved in them, no cheese of any sort, nor any savory (I have this thing for olives!).  Pate was pretty good but not anywhere near as good as the pate we chowed down on at Swirl. Would have loved the figs if maybe they had squeezed some mascarpone into them and then shoved the nuts in. I'm such a foodie critic. To drink we ordered the McManis Cabernet Sauvignon ($55) and it is a very reliable bottle of red. \n\nI opted for (let's be predictable Christine) the steak frites and my friend had the poached halibut. The steak was delicious and cooked to order (medium rare). The frites are so crispy, crunchy and tangled, just the way I love them but what the hell is up with all the salt? I mentioned this to the waiter when he asked me how my meal was and then to his credit he brought out an little bowl of frites sans salt. He insisted. He also apologized for the kitchen as he said sometimes they don't realize how much kosher salt they are tossing into the bowl when they shake up the frites. The halibut was meaty but bland as hell. Then again, it is poached. Great if you are on a diet. Personally I felt it could have been poached in perhaps a court bouillon with lots of fresh herbs. My friend began picking at my plate which tells me that she wasn't sated by her dinner because she dived right into the bowl of extra frites. \n\nWe passed on dessert. After all that meat there was no way I could eat dessert (urp!). All in all, I liked Table 17. The service was great, our waiter as friendly and stayed on top of making sure our glasses were looked after. Still, something just felt slightly off for me and I can't quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it may have just been our location inside of the restaurant, I never really felt like I was in it.  I would be willing though, in all fairness, to give Table 17 another go.   The lamb sounded wonderful as did a couple of the specials of the day.  I so gotta learn to step outside my steak obsession!","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":2}

What do they say about having high expectations? You will usually be disappointed. Sigh. \n\nAnd so it goes...\n\n I loved the space at Table 17. It felt classy rustic, if that makes sense. The intimate bistro (composed of two small rooms) had wood floors and walls, antique lights and a subdued color palette. I felt relaxed. \n\nThe service was superb. Our waitress was more than a joy and spouted all the day's specials by memory and was well-versed in the few wines we were deciding between. She was attentive, humorous and gave great recommendations. \n\nThe food? It was good, but forgetable (don't hate me, Table 17!). I wanted them to elevate the flavors. Punch me in the face and make me giddy. Make me moan with pleasure (food here people, get your mind out of the gutter!). Make me want to lick the plate clean. \n\nLike the last green leaf on a tree whose leaves are changing with the Autumn air, the dolce forte wild boar polenta was the sparkling highlight in the crowd. They change the polenta frequently, but it's a must order. Even if you don't like polenta, order it. The presentation itself is worth it. You are brought a thick slice of wood where the polenta is perched. Two table spoons of fresh herbs and red pepper flakes accompany it. Chef John Sinopoli comes out himself and scoops the pipping hot wild boar out of the pot and onto the polenta as he explains the ingredients and care that went into it. It was delicious. Not too gamy, not too heavy, just right. I would have liked it a bit saltier, but maybe that's just me. I have an addiction to salt (blush). \n\nWe also ordered the chilled white gazpacho (definitely recommend), charcuterie board (typical), warm roasted beets side dish (yummy but I wanted more goat cheese!), summer arugula salad with blue cheese and peaches (the peaches were lovely) and the steak tartare. I am a sucker for steak tartare and always order it when it's on the menu. Table 17 serves it differently, they mix beets into the chopped beef. While some may like this, I did not. It tasted like beets, not meat. I missed the salt (shocked?), the capers, the onions, the quail egg on top, the savory flavors of a traditional steak tartare. \n\nI know every restaurant can't be phenomenal, but at those prices, I am a bit tougher on the food and my expectations are a bit higher. I liked Table 17. I would give it another shot.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":3}

The flavours of each is not very strong....like it didn't punch you in the face. The mushroom flavour was not very full. The lamb flavour was very slight. The one with the most flavour is the goat cheese ball. It really had to be elevated by the sauce at the side. I actually had no issue with that because I often find the gamey taste of lamb and goat distasteful. She on the other hand was slightly disappointed about the legendary hot balls from Table 17. \n\nDiver Scallops: Diver Scallops with Roasted with fresh bay leaves, served with sauce béarnaise & guanciale\nI liked this dish. It was again on the heavier and saltier side. Everything plated works together harmoniously. The scallop balanced the béarnaise and the guanciale perfectly. The texture of the scallop is escalated by the crunchiness of the guanciale. \n\nEntrée:\n\nHaddock: Haddock with chanterelle mushroom, sprouts, truffled potato, radish\nPerhaps our expectations for fresh seafood is a little high. We both felt the haddock is lacking in freshness. Fresh fish tends to hold together better. The sprouts were supposed to reduce the heaviness of the dish but it just wasn't enough. \n\nDessert:\n\nLemon Panna Cotta with Blueberry compote. This dessert hit all the right notes! The panna cotta was silky and smooth (like my legs...just kidding!) The delicious blueberry compote adds fruitiness (DUH!) to the plate! The lemon balm gives it a bite of citrus taste. It was awesome! The combination just sings in your mouth! I can eat that all day! Nom nom nom! \n\nIn the end, I wish the chef would balance the dishes with more acids, spices and fresh herbs instead of sodium and grease. We are definitely anomalies here.

I was horrified that when we showed up, they were going to turn us away (I would!).  But, they did not.  Everyone was very friendly and welcoming.  Our table was waiting for us when we arrived, and we were all served very quickly.  The waiter made excellent suggestions for drinks, apps, and entrees.  Everyone was happy with their meal.  The ambience is nice, quiet yet trendy.  The bathrooms were immaculate and while we were in the front room near the bar, the back room had a center table as a servers station for bread and wine bottles.  The only downside is that the entrees were very small - fortunately they weren't horribly expensive.   The drinks on the other hand....

After a really long, rainy, and cold school week during which my meals mainly consisted of stuff I grabbed from convenience stores on campus, I really needed a good dinner. Table 17 hit just the right spot. We started with a charcuterie plate, which was all kinds of good and porky. The standout starter for me, though, was the Ribollita soup -- a white bean soup with pancetta and kale. I could live off bowls of that stuff. For my main, I chose the braised short ribs. They were fork tender, but slightly dry and tough on top -- maybe I got the top of the pot or something -- but still delicious and just the perfect comfort food that I needed.\n\nService was great for the most part, but they were experiencing problems with their credit card machine that was a little frustrating -- they didn't seem to have a separate phone line for their credit card machine, so every time someone would call the restaurant, it would kick the credit card machine offline. Consequently, it took FOREVER to get our card charged for dinner. The food was excellent and I'm definitely coming back soon (dying to try their BYOW Table D'hote on Sundays and Mondays), but next time I visit, I'm totally bringing cash.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":2}

I thought that there was not mixture between the mozza and cream, so the soft texture of the burrata was lacking. The flavours and other components of the dish paired very well.. just wish there was more creamy goodness.\n\nIt happened to be Good Friday and I really did not plan to eat meat that night. I was tempted to go with the shortribs because I knew I would not be disappointed from my first experience. I was debating between the pasta and one of the fish dishes but there was one component of each dish that did not speak to me.\n\nOn a whim, I went with the scallops at the very last second. It came in a creamy broth (was not a fan at first read) but it had been quite some time since I had some good scallops and I definitely had set some high expectations. On first bite..... I was grinning ear to ear... the scallops were perfectly cooked, loads of flavour in the broth, and I could not get enough. I'm just not a super big fan of clams, so I cannot really comment on them. None the less, I tried to scoop up ever last ounce of the broth on the plate! The short ribs were tender (husband's review), and very tasty.\n\nFor dessert .... I did not have to look at the menu - sticky toffee pudding it is.... it came out hot in a ramekin, loaded with caramel sauce and apple butter on the side. Rich, decadent, tasty, mouth watering..... it was just like I remembered and more! S had the banana cheesecake, which I was hesitant about because I'm not sure how that could go well together... but it was actually surprisingly subtle but evident in banana flavour. With a touch of peanut butter to finish it off, the dessert was a great choice.\n\nI'm so glad that my second experience was just as good as the first.

I enjoyed chewing on the bits of bacon, which added a delectable smokiness to the creamy soup. \n\nI ordered the appetizer special of the day - chicken liver parfait. I absolutely loved this! The liver spread was delightfully creamy and I loved that intense flavour of the liver, complemented by a dab of tangy Dijon mustard.\n\nSteak Frites - 8oz thick cut top sirloin, served with lemon mayo - was executed to perfection.

It is amazing! \n\nBetween four years of college and four years of post college, I have lived in approximately 8 apt complexes in 3 states and Acacia Creek is the BEST overall!!!

There are 3 pools, and 1 is heated, a decent sized gym and lots of uncovered parking. (and a recycling bin!!!) \n\nThe location is great! It's just South of Scottsdale and Shea, on Gold Dust Avenue. Lots of things within walking distance grocery stores (Fresh and Easy, Safeway), bars and restaurants (Baja Bar, Eddies, Chop and Wok, Indulge Burger, Dennys, Oregenos), and two pharmacies.

It does take a long time for the living room to cool down on the hot days (esp being a top floor, corner unit with lots of exposure to the afternoon sun).

Nice 50's decor in Coca-Cola red, white and black. Black marble table tops and black metal chairs. The burgers are a 10 for taste, freshness, all fresh toppings and juiciness say both my daughter and I. My daughter loves the soft fresh sesame buns and wants to know where the owner buys them. The fries are the old fashioned hand cut fresh kind and yes, they do have malt vinegar as well as white vinegar, which \"chips\" IMO should have in a good burger place (daughter of an Englishwoman here). Quite reasonable prices. Single cheeseburger combo with a can of Coke or other soft drink $8.85. Add $1.00 for bottled pop. You order your burger & fries at the back counter and take your can\/bottle of pop from the fridge opposite the counter. The owner says he's trying to cook things the old fashioned way and welcomes customer feedback. I wanted to try the dessert of the day but unfortunately all they had was Nutella milkshake, and I don't like Nutella. Apparently they had an Oreo cheesecake cupcake yesterday but were sold out of it. I gotta try that!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

They offer teas by the pot only, except for iced teas (during warm months) which come by the cup.  They range from $3 to $4 per pot depending on how fancy the tea is.\n\nThe staff here has been friendly every time I've been.  They are always keen on offering suggestions if you ask!  Last time, I was struggling between going for a fruity tea vs. a chocolatey tea, and the girl working suggested this chocolate peppermint tea blend that was not on the menu but that she had made for herself the other day.  I tried it, and it was AMAZING!\n\nMy experiences with the food here (from at least a year ago) have been great as well.  They have their own pastries as well as a selection from a nearby bakery.  Savory offerings include grilled cheeses, soups, and sometimes specials.\n\nOne small gripe I have is that their teapots tend to, for whatever reason or another, leak some tea leaves and residue when you pour into your cup.  I suspect it's because the filter is not super fine and so small bits from the tea mixture can fall through.  It's never been a major problem, though.\n\nYou can always find fun, seasonal specialty drinks here too (e.g. hot apple cider in the fall), in addition to coffee, if tea isn't your thing.  Newspapers and reading materials are usually available to pick up, and there are board games in the back.  This is a great place for a rainy (or cold) day!","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

As a tea lover, having passed it many times on Murray, I'd long been curious about it. My friends who live nearby never wanted to go, however, since they prefer Dobra Tea across the street. Last week, CM wanted to get a hot beverage in the area, and he was game for checking it out, so I was able to do so.\n\nWhen we went to order, the menu had loose leaf teas listed by type (columns) and by grade (rows), which determined their price.  While you can buy them by the cup, if you're with other people or you're planning on hanging out for awhile, it usually makes more sense to get a pot, since each pot provides 2-3 infusions, and hot water is free.  We decided on a pot of the milk (?) oolong ($4.50), recommended by the barista, which was on the lighter side and was quite pleasant.  Once we'd had a pot and refilled it with hot water for a second infusion, we also got a pesto grilled cheese sandwich with tomato as a snack ($4.75), which was crisp and super-flavorful (thanks for the recommendation, fellow Yelpers!), and complemented the tea well.\n\nMy favorite part of Te Cafe, however, was the board games that can be found on the back shelf and front table.  Unfortunately, not all of them are complete, as CM and I found out when we picked up the Ultimate Scenario Game (?), but those that are make for a fun time!  We ended up playing dominoes--which I'd never played with as a game before (just setting them up in rows and knocking them down ;-) ). Since the first two games went quickly, with each of us winning one, we played best out of three. The last game went on to the point I thought we were going to run out of dominoes, but I eventually won.  Yay!\n\nWhile I understand my friends' preference for Dobra, given that they have a more extensive menu of tea and snacks and a more unique Asian tea house-like atmosphere, I enjoyed Te Cafe for a change of pace. I'd definitely return for another visit in the future to sample more interesting teas--and to play another round of dominoes!","useful":14,"funny":8,"cool":10}

If you're drinking on your own or with a single friend, that's fine and dandy- but it's near impossible to have a proper meeting with three or more people without forcing everyone to use inefficient mugs instead.

I know there are a lot of nuances to the preparation, like everything else, that can give you a plethora of subtle variation that you wouldn't get if it was made incorrectly. However, I still can't stand paying for it.\n\nHowever, Te Cafe has a great selection of gourmet teas that make the stop worth it. It's the kind of stuff that, unless you were a tea connoisseur, you would never be tasting. Their menu is full of teas all with names that vary from mundane, to Japanese, to just plain odd. I've been to the Te Cafe a few times but last night I ordered the \"Kokeicha\". It's a kind of smokey green tea that you steep for 3 minutes. I tried to order a tea by the name of \"gunpowder\" but they were sadly out of it. The man behind the counter informed me that the \"Kokeicha\" was very similar.\n\nThe tea was great and, honestly, even when something's not your cup of tea you have a fun experience. It's something you usually don't get to try on your own. Who would honestly buy 23 dollars worth of loose leaf tea that they've never tried? I'll leave it to the Te Cafe to let me sample them a pot at a time.\n\nEvery time I enter the cafe the staff are friendly, accommodating, and most of all informative. They know their way around tea so someone who is completely ignorant, as I am, can get a little guidance. It's a fun place to relax and enjoy a beverage you usually wouldn't; how often do you drink gunpowder at home?","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

But this place is a one-track pony... location, location, location. This is a family-owned bar\/restaurant and the owners know they have a captive audience. The beer is cold and the food is average, but the service is atrocious. On a recent beautiful Saturday afternoon, there were only two servers for the outside seating area.  There's no host, so we (4 adults and 1 kid) sat at a picnic table and proceeded to wait at least 10 minutes to no avail. We eventually went inside to order drinks and lunch. At no time during our visit did a server ever approach our table. I'd certainly be inclined to write off this awful experience to a bad day or poor staffing, but unfortunately this is more the rule rather than exception. One really weird thing is the Friday Fish Fry that features a special menu available ONLY inside, this isn't communicated very well;  so you'll grab a table outside, wait to order only to learn you can only order from the pizza\/sandwich menu.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Not my favorite, but it would do.\n\nMy second visit I was very excited to try one of their specialty sandwiches the Deluxe Roast Beef Press (only with 9 grain instead of sourdough) ! However when I arrived they had run of or roast beef, but I was told they were expecting their shipment to arrive tomorrow. Still hungry and not wanting to wait till tomorrow to eat I decided to try the Vegetarian Delight. $8.00 later my meal was... okay. Good sized, but in the end not what I was really hoping for when I had first came.\n\nToday I went to give it one more try. I got the Sandwich \"your way\" which I ordered Roast Beef, imported Swiss, on 9 grain with Lettuce and Spicy brown mustard. I also got a huge chocolate chip cookie and a Caramel Macchiato to wash it down. A total that came to $13.38. I arrived at my office and to my surprise my 9 grain bread turned into Sourdough - My least favorite bread... \n\nTo say the least I really wanted to like this place, but I am not blow away by The Lunch Lounge. I have given them a 3 for effort. - Also to add I found out this last visit that they only have soup on Tuesday's","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The initial reason I started going here less often was a noticeable decrease in their salad sizes a few years back, hence I ask for extra spinach. One good thing they have going for themselves is that the veggies they use in their salads always taste fresh, for that reason I gave them two starts instead of one.

FYI - they don't always have all of the patties listed on the menu available to order so just ask before you get too committed to a particular flavor. The woman went into the back and came right back out with my patty. Nice and warm, ready to eat.\n\nI went into the back seating area while my friends finished placing their orders. The patty was a fluorescent yellow color which threw me off a little bit but when I bit into it, my fears were long forgotten. The patty crust was flaky and had a little bit of a sweet flavor that balanced the mild heat from the meat inside. The Jamaican soda was very sweet, which should come as no surprise since its second ingredient is high fructose corn syrup. It's definitely not anything I would probably have again but it was good enough to wash down my patty. I got to taste a bit of my friends' meals and I really, really enjoyed the jerk chicken.

The patties are worthy of 6 stars, the only reason I gave the 4 stars is because every time I visit the music is blaring and the air conditioning seems to be turned off or not working.

And be prepared for a wait, if you have been to the Islands then you know the slower pace you have to get used to. \n\nI have tried several of their curry dishes, the goat was my favorite.

Walking inside I was greeted by a sweet young girl who also took my order and she was nice about going over the menu and what the specials included. Inside was clean and decorated nicer than I expected. There was also a good amount of customers eating inside which I took as a good sign. \n\nI noticed they had different daily specials on the windows out front and they are totally worth checking out. I was here on a Friday and the special that day is 2 enchiladas, beans, rice and a drink all for $5.95 before tax. Great deal! The rice was lacking a bit on flavor and while the beans could have used more cheese, they did taste good and I liked the few tortilla chips on top of them. The enchiladas had a decent amount of cheese inside and the sauce tasted good. I'd for sure come back for this special again.\n\nAl Pastor Taco ($1.75) - The tacos come meat, onion and cilantro. There's a salsa bar with veggies and containers. I grabbed some of the red and green sauce and favored the green. My taco was filled nicely and had great flavor. \n\nCarne Asada Burrito ($5.99) - Here's where things got odd for me. Hubby and I intended to share this and he always prefers just meat, cheese and sour cream in his burritos. The girl who took our order said he couldn't have it that way and that the burrito had to have beans and rice inside. If the burritos aren't pre-made this shouldn't be a hard request at all. I saw a different girl putting meat on the grill and then put the burrito together, so I can't figure out why the burrito couldn't be customized to have the rice and beans left off. The burrito was a nice size for the price and did taste good, but it would have been better enjoyable if it could have been made the way preferred. \n\nGreat weekly deals and decent Mexican food. I'd come back.","useful":66,"funny":42,"cool":67}

Learning that they were closed, I found something in the area with excellent reviews and was happy to find this location with a Yelp check-in.  I skimmed the reviews and saw several 4\/5 star reviews with a couple of 2 star reviews so I decided to give this place a shot. \n\nService was excellent and I was impressed with the politeness and grammar used in both English and Spanish upon walking in and ordering. It reflected that the business cares about the customer and how they are perceived when spoken to by the various clientele. \n\nI immediately placed an order for the chips and beans and was happy to see breakfast items on a menu. My foodie friend ordered a pastor burrito and I ordered chilaquiles with green sauce. Unfortunately, this is where I should've listened to the 2-star reviews. \n\nWhile I believe that the food is made fresh in-house, the quality lacks and pales in comparison to the service. The beans lacked flavor, excluding the cotija cheese and the chips were stale. This is probably a storage issue. The salsa were flavorful, but lacked spice. Interestingly enough, the green salsa was the spiciest. \n\nMy friends pastor burrito was just ok. Not fantastic, not terrible. Just ok. It probably is similar to Roberto's, my terrible baseline for Mexican food flavor and service. My chilaquiles were tragic. The rice was pretty bad and the green sauce was pretty boring. It's sad to say that Del Taco has better rice, beans, and green sauce. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the dish and I won't return anytime soon.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0}

Since then, I swore off coming to this place ever again (no matter what corner of the world). \nSo after successfully boycotting this restaurant for 12 years, I was forced into going on a recent family dinner. \n\nNow I'll tell you why I will not go back again:\n\n1. They sat us directly next to the cash and a waiter just hovered outside of the register directly behind my seat. Table was not clean! \n\n2. We were a party of 6 and received 3 menus. When I asked for an additional 3 menus, I was handed one without a word and the waiter walked away. Another one walked by and I asked for an additional two menus and was asked why I couldn't share and rolled her eyes?! (Ummm ok)\n\n3. Six people, 5 spoons. It was a mission to get another spoon. \n\n4. One of our appetizers came after our mains because we asked if it was coming (I'm guessing they forgot to put in the order)? \n\n5. Not enough napkins. We asked for more and got 2. (Maybe they're saving money by reducing napkin waste?!) \n\n6. Had to ask four times for extra sambhar before getting any. \n\nOverall, the food was not anything special. There are many other dosa places that serve far better quality food and actually care about their customers. The service is horrendous. We went on a Monday evening around 6pm. They were not busy and many servers were just hanging around chatting with each other. When interacting with customers they behave in a manner that leads me to believe that the customer is a burden and they are not interested in ensuring a positive experience.\n\nThank you for reminding me why I had not eaten here since 2005 and why I should never eat here again.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

The only upgrade as of now is the restaurant itself. A few months ago it was very unattractive, almost cafeteria style, with hard seats like you would find in a food court. Kudos to them for getting a massive facelift. I wish I took pictures, but it looks lovely inside. They even have an electric fireplace (for some reason) in the tiny entrance. \n\nBut ambiance aside, the food itself did not get a similar makeover. I will never again order a masala dosa from this place. There was a mere SMEAR of potato bhaji, a few tablespoons at most, in my dosa. The chutneys were pretty bland and also in small amounts. The best thing was the sambar, spicy and warming. The dosa itself was very oily.\n\nMy dad had the Saravanaa Special Meal, which consisted of ten TINY dishes (curries, chutneys, curd and a gulab jamun), rice, two papad and two pooris. As is the apparent custom here, the poories were miniscule. They were baby poories. I mean, how much are they saving really by cutting the quantity of their menu items? \n\nAnd it's not like this place isn't hopping. We got there at 7pm for dinner and already a queue had formed. This was the trend for the rest of the night, and people even crowded outside and left when they were told it would be a half an hour wait.\n\nThe waitstaff were pleasant enough, although our server tried to take away my plate before I had finished. They also left the front door open for a while, telling us \"the air conditioning was not working\". It is necessary to note that it was 10 degrees tonight, not a balmy summer at all. \n\nThis restaurant is NOT good for groups. There are tables of 4, and they can put a few together if needed. But do not come in with a group of 15, like people did tonight, and assume you will get a table quickly. Check ahead of time if you can make reservations.\n\nMy mom had the best meal tonight, the Mini Tiffin. It came with uppama, mini idlis in sambar, a mini dosa (with probably the same amount of bhaji as my dosa!) and a sweet. The sweet sheera was delicious, with cashews and raisins. Sad I didn't go for that.\n\nPROS:\n- nice ambiance, comfortable booths\n- delicious, spicy sambar\n\nCONS: \n- oily dosas with virtually no filling\n- crowded early, stays that way through dinner\n- NOT good for groups (call ahead)\n- hasty servers who do not consider the weather\n- miniature food","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

My review is going to be a mild comparison of the two. \nWe decided to try Saravan Bhavan a few days ago as I like trying different options. \nThe breakfast buffet on Sunday is from 10-12 and we had arrived at 11:10 to quite a line up.

The sambhar and tomato chutney is delicious as well. \nOne of the reasons I crave this breakfast is because I love Rava Kesari and Payasam. The rava kesari was quite tasteless and the payasam seemed to have been thickened with starch rather than reduced the way it should be. \nWe asked for two coffees as we noticed that there were no beverages in the buffet area (In comparison, anjapar has coffee that you help yourself to) and they brought us two very small coffees that were quite good. We didn't know until it was time to pay the bill that each of the 150 ml coffees were $2.25 each adding $4.50 to the total. \nFor two people with coffee the bill came to $29.90 plus tip. \n\nI have rated it two stars because of the overall experience - food, service and pricing. \n\nFinal verdict: Liked- vadas, dosas, idly, sambhar and taste of the coffee\nDisliked: Service, wait time, pricing, poor tasting deserts, overall experience. \n\nWon't return.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I also found that the chutneys were rather inconveniently served to the left into three portions of the thali (steel square plate)\n-The sambar was okay; nothing special. For some odd reason unbeknownst to me, they had used 2 katoris (small steel bowls) which were stuck together to serve the sambar in \n-As for service, there was only one person serving when mom and I went here for lunch making service slow. \n\nSure it was decently priced; but the quality of food and service was worth WAY LESS than the $8 we cashed out for each dosa.

I equate it to going to your favorite wine tasting room and enjoying the various types of wine, except it's delicious beer (obviously). (e.g.; the Nines, you gotta try the Nines!). What it is not is a pub or a sports bar with super loud people, Budweiser and NFL whistles blowing from 50 TV screens...which is refreshing.  I feel a person just starting to develop their beer palette would feel right at home bellying up to the bar along side a person with a honed, mature beer palette. It's a place to try and sample what suits your beerbuds best.  With tons of amazing beer options that have awesome names you know have a story behind them, you can't go wrong.  My husband tried the coffee brown ale and he loved it! Oh, and it looks like they offer special \"reserve\" and yummy flavored type brews each week as well.

The amount of beer that comes with this deal is ridiculous - no joke!!\n\nIt's a nice looking establishment - very cool inside look...

Some of the beers were awesome, some okay, some were hard to drink.  A place like this is for a true beer conoausor because they do offer a fair amount of diverse beers, but I don't know enough about beer, how it's made, ingredients, etc. to be overly critical about beer quality per say.  I would have to say that the darker beers here seemed smoother than the light\/amber, and the beer made by\/using coffee were the best tasting in my personal opinion.\n\nWhen we first arrived the place was slammed - we could hardly find a place to sit down.  But oddly enough, the crowd died down very fast and by the time we finished our tasting around 7:30ish there was hardly anyone left in the place - it was dead for the most part, which seemed rather odd on a Friday evening.  The staff here was good - but no one was especially friendly or went out of there way service wise even when it got super slow....\n\nThe crowd seemed like college kids for the most part ...

It was a great crowd, and excellent beer.\nThere were two food trucks, one served poutine made Southwestern style, and instead of french fries, they sliced up tamales, and served the gravy and chilies on the top of that! By the way, that food truck was run by a guy named Craig.\nI had tried three of their beers the pale ale the IPA and the red and they were all excellent beers. I been to them before when they were cartel brewing and they were over in the old apartment building, and when they were in the coffee shop, but this venue is really nice and the the energy is palpable!\nI definitely will come back here, even when there are no political celebrities!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They really have the small-neighborhood-brewery thing down pat. I had the pleasure of chatting with one of the brewers, Andy, at the Strong Beer Festival while sampling their limited edition releases specifically for said event. The beers I tried there were AMAZING! One was the FYITM another was a special FYITM [i think a fruity version], and something else I can't recall. \n\nA week or so after, I host a Sunday Funday at The Shop for a large group of friends and luckily remembered to tell Andy about it at the Festival. He and his team were gracious enough to reserve space for our group. The weather didn't want to cooperate that Sunday but when I arrived it was fairly dead inside so I pushed together large floor tables in the corner with no problems. Andy did such a great job going over the beer list many times as people came in at varied times as well as keeping track of what we ordered and making sure the glasses did not run dry. I definitely recommend doing the flight - it's $8 for 4 samples which can be a mix from The Shop and\/or some from their guest beers. If I have to pick just 2 beers from The Shop to drink, #1 is the Galactic Porter Patrol nitro, #2 is Circus Bandit. \n\nI also recommend their food truck outside. While the guy\/waiter wasn't the kindest, the food was fabulous. I really loved the chicken tacos I had. Other positives I noted were the hummus dip and burger. I believe the food menu changes often [don't quote me]. Their ordering system is kind of confusing because you have to order beer & food separately but they come out on one check.

Recently it was thin mints, once it was jalapenos and sometimes they serve it with an accompanying bite (once it was a donut). Follow them on Instagram for Randall announcements as well as updates about entertainment, sometimes they host bands on the patio.\n\nThey do have a food truck, Fire and Foraged, which is basically a permanent on-site fixture. They are super creative with their food and have one of the best burgers I've ever had. They source a lot of their food locally-greens from Rhiba Farms and meat from Doublecheck Ranch-and as much as I hate not being able to rely on my favorites, I like that I'm hardly eve disappointed when I try something new.

I have been there over a dozen times now and easily over half of my drinks have been this way.  After a dozen visits I would say service is 60% good, 20% meh, and 20% bad.  I know it may seem minuscule to some but when you are buying premium product there should be pride in the company to give the customer what they are offering.

After seeing someone else with it, we also ordered the calamari with slaw and chili paste and, by far the best dish of the evening, the black miso seared cod. I've been remembering that cod all weekend, it was so good. There were a lot of other things on the menu that I wanted to try as well. Maybe another time.\n\nActually, everything was really, really good. This was a place I would want to revisit if I lived in Madison. Although we didn't order anything off it, they did have a specials menu with at least three items, and the very extensive sake menu. \n\nContrary to what one of the other reviewers said, I think it would be really hard for the average person to spend $100 alone unless you just stuffed yourself silly. We ordered five dishes total and two small bottles of sparking sake to share among three women and the bill was $85. Actually I couldn't quite believe how reasonable the bill was when it came. \n\nBTW, make reservations.

IMO, the former more than makes up for the latter, which is at its worst just a bit slow and unconcerned.  (Once, for example, we were two dishes into our meal before our first round of drinks arrived.)\n\nBut, ahh, the food.  This is probably the most creative food in Madison.  I describe it as pan-asian fusion in a tapas form factor.  There is some sushi, and some is even pretty good (I'm thinking of the signature duck mango avocado rolls).  That said, it's a mistake to think of Muramoto as a sushi place, though (there is a Muramoto sushi restaurant in the hilldale area ) -- my favorite dishes here have included the soy cod, a lamb curry, and a few amazing salads.  In my experience, the oft-changing menu contains little that isn't great -- an omnivore with an open-minded palate could safely close their eyes and just start pointing.\n\nCome with an appetite and prepare to spend a bit of change (dinner for 2 with drinks and dessert will exceed $100), and avoid the tables in the front near the door on cold days.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I'd consider coming back just for that concoction alone.  We ordered the Tuna with Wasabi Flying Roe, Shrimp in Spicy Coconut Sauce, and the Pan Seared Scallop. (which was the favorite dish)  All of our food embodied unique flavors, and were demonstrations of  \"Asian fusion\" done right.  Our server was incredibly helpful with questions, and prompt without seeming as if she was trying to rush us out the door.  \nAlso prices were not that bad.  For 2 entrees, 1 roll, and drinks we exited the restaurant only about $60-ish poorer (including tip). I am definitely returning.

Think Japanese Tapas. Reviews prior to November at this location should be thought as applying to it's new location, just down the street. \n\nI was not impressed by the food at Kushi. Your order will come out quickly, because almost everything is fried, fried, fried. The exception is the Donburi -- something yummy on rice. Our Eel Donburi was solid, and decently priced for $8... but if you're a Midwesterner with a healthy appetite like me, don't think this will make a meal. \n\nI also have a complaint about the drinks. My Cosmo was delicious -- and also standard Cosmo size and price ($7). However, because they make all their mixed drinks here with sake instead of vodka, what you're getting really packs much less of a punch than what you'd get elsewhere.\n\nThe pluses are this: The atmosphere hasn't change since this was the pricey Muramoto, So it's a groovy low-lighting place to hang.

Their other spot cross town is an incredible sushi restaurant with everything under the sun. Here, only have a few rolls on the menu (and they are incredible), but that is not why you come. Come for the tasty, hot dishes, and for the sake flights.\n\nEvery so often, you eat a meal that is soooo good, so perfect in almost every way, and the tastes are so unforgettable, that you want to get right up then and there, and do what I affectionately call, The Food Dance. This is food that makes your eyes roll back into your head with every bite, and leaves you wondering where the hell you have been eating all these years. This was, hands down, my saving grace in Madison. Presentation of the food is spectacular. Eating alone? Sit at the bar and stare at um-teen bottles of Japanese sake. Eating with a group? Even better, as the sushi rolls they do have there (soft-shell crab or avocado and mango roll w\/ thin-sliced duck breast on top, drizzled with a duck reduction sauce, or a few others) are HUGE. Don't think California sushi, as each roll which costs $10 has about ten large slices, and you will find it hard to eat an entire one by yourself. These rolls would easily be double the price if this was in SF.  Look for Michael, the tall, bald-shaven, server\/barman that knows everything about the menu, and can recommend many good sakes on the list. Try the sake flight (3 glasses) for a nice accompaniment to any meal. Now for the best part........you want small slices of some of the tastiest beef anywhere? Get the hangar steak. Not a large portion (meaning not a whole steak) but you get several slices of this beef, drizzled with a white miso-bleu cheese sauce that is to DIE FOR. Not a fan of bleu cheese? No worries, as the taste is made subtle by the combining with miso. But please, do yourself a favor - ORDER THIS DISH! Not a big beef fan? That's fine, as the Grilled Miso Black Cod is their signature dish. My suggestion? Start with some sake, and order yourself one sushi roll, and one hot dish. Take a few people, and everyone order a few different things, and share. And won't you be happy when you get out of there, after all this tasty food, and still you are not over the per diem. And if you are, maybe you shouldn't have had that third drink. Be advised - this place has a little wooden sign in the window, and it took me forever to find it. Do me one better, and take the address WITH YOU when you go!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Next were the oyster\/quail egg shots. What a nice melding of flavors. This was followed by the corn\/lemongrass chowder- big disappointment, but I'll let it slide.\n\nOn to the main courses- started with the tuna\/mayo roll. This was a quite a big portion and really was a great sushi roll for those that like the bells and whistles. The hangar steak was tasty. The bleu cheese sauce was just perfect and made the steak that much better. Could have used just a tad more crust on the meat. Finally, we had the miso black cod. This is how fish should taste. It melted in your mouth, and was salty, but in a great way. \n\nTIP- go early or late (after 9) because they don't take reservations.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The service is always great, not just that they are prompt and attentive, but they know the menu and the drink menu and can make intelligent recommendations that I am usually pleased with.  Muramoto's creative rolls are SO delicious, they are all different tasting and the only comparison to their taste comes from good sushi places in Chicago.

Ok, with that out of the way....\n\nThe Space:  Just like the old Muramoto that was there, its a great space and feels like a 'big city' restaurant.  Dark, calm, cool, and the lighting is superb.  Great date place and it just feels sexy.\n\nThe Food:  I wanted to like it, I really did.  We ordered a wide variety of small plates and not ONE of them was good.  In fact, even they even managed to blow bacon-wrapped figs stuffed with blue cheese.  Now thats not easy to screw up.  The plates ranged from merely ok to bad (octopus 'balls' were like fried croquettes with elastic bands in the middle).  \n\nThe Drinks:  Drinks were good.  Good pours, good selection and the Japanese booze was interesting.  \n\nThe Price:  Here's why Kushi Bar received an extra star.  The place is cheap for what it is, especially the drinks.\n\nSo all in all, go for drinks, ambiance and to impress a date.  Maybe even order a small plate or two but don't expect it to taste as gourmet as it sounds on the menu...","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The food and the service is great.\n\nSesame Crusted Big Eye Tuna with tahini sauce - I love it!  The sauce is so nutty and tasty and goes perfectly with the tuna and mixed greens.\n\nRock Crab Croquettes - it's their version of crab cakes but they deep fry the croquettes (4) and they arrive at your table piping hot.  They're delicious! - reminds me of my beloved dungeness crabs back home.   \n\nShrimp and Spicy Coconut Sauce with crushed peanuts - this is pretty good.  It's very similar to Thai food.\n\nHangar Steak with bean salad in bleu cheese & miso dressing - both times I've had it it's been a little tough and very chewy.  The bean salad (scattered around the steak on a long rectangular plate) drenched in the dressing is quite good.\n\nDESSERTS\nWe ordered the Sample Platter.  I'm glad we did because we were able to try some really interesting desserts.  This Platter is perfect for two people.\n\nYuzu (Japanese Citrus Fruit) Panna Cotta - a little more firm than normal panna cotta.  Didn't really taste the citrusy fruit.  But it was very good.  It kind of reminded me of a smoother version of cheesecake without the graham cracker crust.  It also had a drizzle of some berry compote.\n\nStrawberry Spring Roll w\/Honey ginger ice cream - I really liked the spring roll.  It was nice and hot and I think there was some sweetened sticky rice in it as well.  I'm a big fan of ginger but for some reason I didn't like the ice cream.\n\nHoney Black Sesame Creme Brulee - this was not my favorite but it was interesting.  The creme wasn't super creamy but had a little texture to it.  The color of the creme was a dark charcoal grey and tasted like smokey sesame.  It's a clever idea but not something I would try again.\n\nKabocha (Japanese pumpkin\/squash) Cheesecake - pumpkiny cheesecake with cinnamon or nutmeg with maple syrup lining the plate was my favorite.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The duck roll is outstanding as are the oyster shots, which are my favorite way to start dinner.\n\nCriticism-wise, there is a bit of a problem with seating in the wintertime, as there is quite a draft coming in from the door if you sit too close to it.  Moreover, you cannot make reservations at Muramoto.  This means of course that you cannot request a table further away from the door if you want to in advance (first come first serve).\n\nService is just fine, ambiance is lovely.  Come with a date, not your kids and definitely not in your red UW sweatshirt.  Dress to impress; this is a spot for grownups only.\n\n!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!! \nDowntown Muramoto has moved to an new location, which is interestingly just down the road from their old location.  This solves the drafty chill issue, there are LOTS more seats, and you can now make rezzos.  On the downswing, it's missing something of its original, uniquely Madisonian charm.  It now has vaulted ceilings, adequate lighting, and at least one waitress of questionable moral character.  Plus they have an additional location by the Hilldale Mall which is yet another step down.  I think what I'm saying is that Muramoto sold out to the man and is now no longer actually hip or trendy.  But honestly, it's still quite nice and the food is very good.  The new Hilldale location does not have the oyster shots, but they do have a delicious octopus salad which knocks me sockies off.  You might as well keep going.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

In the year I've been going here, Kim has barely said two words to me (which is Ok. I just want my nails done). I continued to go back week after week because she was good.

I was told her arm hurts too much after buffing my nails and she feels awkward. You're kidding, right? Now, if I was a jerk customer; demanding, loud, lousy tipper, etc I can see it. But I'm none of that. In fact, when I find what I like, I'm loyal. And I've been loyal here. And I pay without complaint. And I tip well, always.

I had to go to several different shops here in Arizona, since moving here 17 years ago, before I found the right one. I was very happy at that salon for almost 10 years. During those 10 years, I went to the same nail tech,for about 8 of the 10 years,he did\na great job, my nails lasted, and all was well! \nFor personal reasons I had to find a new salon.\nSo I went to a new place, it had high reviews and I got a new set and a gel pedicure! Everyone was nice and all looked okay, but they were so SLOW I was there 5 HOURS!!...I couldn't imagine ever going back there again, they were closed for over an hour, and I was still in there , the ONLY 1 in there!.....Not fun! \nSo I was stressed after that  , and knew I needed to  find a new place so now I am in the present time, and brings me to my review here today.  I took my time,and for 2 weeks,  I really did my homework. I researched, googled. read reviews, and finally decided on where I would go.  I chose Fancy Nails & Spa on Cave Creek Rd in Phoenix.  I didn't just make an appointment either. After I was done with all my research , I called about  4 of  the salons,  and went in person,  to see the salons, and speak to them, as well, as look at there selections of powders \/ colors. \nWhen I first called Fancy nails I spoke to the Owner David, he was very friendly. He offered for me to come in, and take a look, and told me they would take care of me, When I went to the shop, again he was friendly, I decided to make an appointment. For a new set and gel pedicure with Kim also eye brow wax.\nThey didn't have the chunky\/confetti powder that I am used to, but assured me they could order at a later time.My nails seemed okay, I was just glad to have them done, and have found a place, that I didn't  pay to close attention.As the holidays were fast approaching and I was very busy at that time. The gel pedicure was good looked nice. But I was a bit disapointed that my, toe nails were grown out so quickly, as I had said please make them extra short, I like them short. And even after she first cut them, I asked her to trim off more, glad I did, because they were still to long. I figured though it was my first time, so next time it will be better. \nI always got compliments  on my nails, especially the last 10 years. Well all of a sudden no one is complimenting me?! I thought that is really strange?!\nAfter a couple days I looked harder at my nails and I could see every little mark under the pink area?...and it looked weird....they never looked like that before. . I had them use medium pink, same thing I had always used, for 10 years . Then still no compliments, and each day they looked worse... it was like you could see all the drill marks straight through it, on my nail beds. I went back to my next appointment because now new years Eve was here, and I had a party to go to. This time the same thing happened with my nails, and my pedicure also. Now my daughter is asking me whats wrong with my nails?...And even my husband!. They don't  look nice anymore, my husband says. I wanted to cry. So I called the nail salon and spoke to David the owner, he said come in and he would take care of me himself.\nSo I did, and he said they needed to be removed, and cleaned up underneath, and a whole new set, and he would take care of me, and he did!...:) So now everything will be okay..right?\nwrong!!....\nIt helped,  But he had to drill my nail beds way way down a lot and it hurt real real bad to do that!...I had another pedicure by a different tech, once again I explained they were left to long  2 times, and I like them extra short,  make them very short. They said yes but, they did not.\nAfter 2 weeks ( and still no compliments) I was beside myself. So I made my appointment with David again, thinking Id try one more time. And when I got there I showed him all the drill marks on my nail beds. He then showed his daughter Hannah, and had her do my nails.She said would do back \/ fill and use \"her\" medium pink powder.  and it will cover all those marks. She then proceeded, without saying anything to literally rip off my finger nail, it hurt!. I pulled away, in pain, and said, no! you need to soak them off!..and she laughed!! and said I was sensitive and begin to rip again!.OMG!I couldnt believe it now there was BLOOD! and a huge throbbing pain she laughed again! I had tears It hurt for the whole time, she was not even sorry.When she was finally finished, They looked good, so I thought it might be Okay Well wrong again! 2 days later 1 nail was lifting!..I called Hannah.Can she please fix it? She said to busy!!..Maybe tomorrow!!?? I got really upset. Then she said ok come in.The owner David looked at it, he fixed it, and never said 1 word to me the whole time.I knew right then, I would not be returning. Next day another nail lifted and came off 1 by 1 til all are gone just shy of 12 days! OMG","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Called to make an appointment to do my gel nails, and the man on the phone was very clear about directions. Upon arriving there i can absolutely see why people might get lost. They're tucked into the back of a complex on Rose Garden lane. Easiest way to get there would be to turn and go east onto Rose Garden lane and then turn left (north) into the red brick complex. They're straight ahead of you there. \n\nIt's a nice new place, and was pretty busy when I got there, even though it was 1000 on a Saturday and they had only opened at 0900. Most people were actually there for pedis. Since I had an appointment I was seated almost right away, and they got down to removing my previous gel manicure and get a new one on me.\n\nI do have to make a disclaimer- I hadn't always had a great experience with gel nails. I did them for my wedding and loved them, and went back to get them done after they grew out, for a bachelorette party in Vegas. The removal process was horrid- they used this thing to scrape the stuff off and it felt awful. And then I left, went shopping and literally in an HOUR had a giant chip. Of course there was no time to go back and get it fixed. It was a very disappointing experience.\n\nBut getting mine done when I was out of town had been pleasant, and my best friend said she was addicted to them. So I decided to give it a shot again. \n\nAnd I'm glad I did. The removal process here was quick and painless- the gel manicure crumbled off when it came time to scrape it off, no awful sensations necessary. They had a great range of colors, and my lady even tried to recommend another color for me. (I wound up sticking with the color I wanted). The nails were beautifully done, and she did them promptly- I was in and out of the place in under an hour. I did decide to wait about a week to do a review, to see how well these puppies wear. The manicure I had prior to this chipped a bit on the thumbs within a week, which was also a bit disappointing.\n\nA week and these nails look as good as they did when I left the salon. I'm hard on my nails too- I pound at a keyboard, and have two big, rough dogs at home. These still look great- no chips, wonderful shine. \n\nI think I might have found my newest addiction, and I'll definitely be back to get them done again! \n\nPlease do note that you can pay with DEBIT cards, but not credit. Also, like several reviewers noted below- bring CASH to tip.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I made an appointment the day before to get a gel pedicure, and a back fill. The reviews I read were really great. I'd been seeing the same nail tech for 6yrs and never had I complained. However she moved to California. They put me with a guy that didn't speak any English. I get my pedicure & nails done every 10 days. this young man took 90mins doing nothing! He put callus remover on my feet and then place them in the water Hmmm... I wonder where he got his nail tech license? He didn't remove the skin or calluses on my feet after putting callus remover on them. The shape of my toenails are not the same or even. Oh! And he forgot to massage my feet!! Then the owner came over and told me that they're really busy and couldn't do my nails and could I come back tomorrow and he would do a very good job on my nails for me!! \nI sat in that chair for 90 minutes frustrated with this moron that shouldn't be doing pedicures or any other kind of service. It was inadequate & way below average customer service. I watched the owner book appointments for ladies that just walked in with no appointment and ask them to come back in 20mins. Well I dealt with being stressed out by someone that was not properly doing their service then being told that they didn't have time to do my nails because they were too busy! I was charged $48 for something that I most certainly was not happy with. I told the owner to stick it up his A..\n\nHow can anyone be so rude I don't know? I wish there was a law or a requirement that in order to get your license to be a nail technician or to perform any kind of public service that every individual of any race needed to speak and understand The English language fluently before they were able to obtain their license!  \nI owned 2 hair salons in scottsdale and I don't ever recommend anyone going to fancy nails.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

A good thing to see with all the For Lease signs that have been cropping up lately.\n\nIf someone could translate what is yelled at patrons once they enter, it would be greatly appreciated.  I'll assume it is a greeting.  The friendly staff that helped us explained that the general restaurant experience is that of arriving, eating and then leaving to go enjoy something else, somewhere else.  The Izakaya experience is designed for you to eat, drink, socialize, etc. all under one roof.  Hence the loud and sometimes frantic atmosphere.  Pretty much a tapas menu.\n\nAfter perusing the Sake menu, my wife and I settled on some Sapporo, mine in the bath-sized glass.  It wasn't that the Sake menu wasn't impressive, but my wife doesn't love it, I have limited experience with the Gekkeikan brand and I just wasn't in the mood to take a chance on a 3 oz, $15-30 sake that I may or may not like.  Maybe if I'd have been encouraged or had some sort of crash course I would have considered.\n\nAny way, food:\n\nIn absence of a bread basket, you are given what is called thin spaghetti, coated in salt and flavoured with a spicy curry.  A little strange a different as it is like eating spicy uncooked spaghetti.  \n\nStarted with the Cucumber Addiction - sliced pickled cucumber with sesame seed and oil.  A great clean-tasting starter.  All orders come out fast and furious, but staggered so as not to bung up the table too much.\n\nThe Pork Rib Kakuni was really good.  3 fall off the bone pork ribs that are slow braised and served on mashed potato with a spicy mustard for more flavour.  This was really tasty and a good portion of meat for only 3 pork ribs.\n\nThe Soy Bean Cream Crab Croquette is a mouthful.  Resembling arancini balls, but stuffed with crab, there 3 little guys are filling and have more substance to them than your average crab dish.\n\nThe Tuna Carpaccio is delicious with a savoury mixture coating the fish.  A little tricky to pick up with the chop sticks, as it is chopped rather finely, but worth the effort.\n\nThe Deep Fried Prawns are quite massive and heavy on the garlic, but the spicy sauce make 'em quite a lovely plate and pretty to look at once delivered.\n\nAs the evening progresses, more and more residents of Oakville filter in.  There is a lot of bumping and jockeying for room in this narrow little space.  Conversations can be heard from basically every table.  The fake-chested table were amazed when Barbie's shorter sister came in, no less than one month after giving birth and back to her fighting weight.  A quick cat walk, a twirl and they're sat beside us.  Yaaaaay.\n\nThis is where service fell apart.  We had one more order coming and we were contemplating another round of drinks and possibly dessert.  But with all the air-kissing going on and the place getting louder and packed, the person taking our orders came back to our table after 15-20 minutes, stating that he'd forgotten to enter our last dish.  Another 20 minutes later and the special of the night Cod we'd ordered arrived.  It was incredible and naturally buttery.  Any aggressive thoughts were forgotten instantaneously.\n\n\nFood for Thought:  if you come for the special catches of the day, come early.  4 of the 6 fish specials were sold out by 7:30.  And the Blowtorch Mackerel?  It may be delicious but smells of burnt arm hair.  Maybe its just me and my wacky palette.\n\nHopefully the \"trendiness\" wears off in the passing months.  The food is quite good and staff are helpful, sincere and very knowledgeable with the menu.  It is the clientelle that I could do without.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

Since we were interested in the Pirates game, it worked out, they have a few TV's in the bar for such purposes. \nWe ordered our drinks; Prosecco & Malbec. Both by the glass. Our server gave us big glasses of water with out drinks so A+ there. \nThe bread came out first and it was awesome. Perfectly warmed, large slices, crunchy crusted Italian bread that tasted like it was made in house. Served with ambient temperature butter (another pet peeve of mine is ice cold butter) so A+\nThe salad came out next and was the first area where we'd recommend a little change, maybe a little larger for sharing between two. But it was flavorful, cold, and dressed just right. The fresh cracked pepper added to it so overall: B\nNext our entrees: I had the Three-Cheese Lasagna my partner had the Gambellini Fra Diavolo (sorry if I misspelled it.) they came out at just the right temperature and at the same time. I tried a bite of his dish and the Diavolo was mild, but with a \"back-of-the-throat\" heat which is perfect. So: \"A\" for his dish. My lasagna was rather impressive, and I didn't realize the recipe was total cheese lasagna, but it was delicious. The only downside would be a personal preference of a little more herbs or spice in the cheese mixture. The tomato  sauce was slightly sweet and tasted of homemade. So well worth trying! \nOverall the reason behind the 4-star review is only for the slight downsides, but again, could just be my personal preference. \nI highly recommend coming here to try it out!

It was sweet, watery, spotted with oil, and devoid of any kind of seasoning.  Oh, it had a few sliced mushrooms, too.  I chose pasta with white sauce for the side.  Bad move.  It was pasta tossed in plain white sauce - no cheese, no garlic, not even a bit of salt.\n\nMy wife had the shrimp scampi ($22).  It came with 4 or 5 shrimp that were actually quite big.  They weren't overcooked.  The sauce, again, was a watery mess, a bunch of butter quickly thrown together with some white wine.  The whole thing was topped with *garlic powder*.

I have never been ignored in a restaurant before but now, based on the reviews, I'm glad we didn't waste money on the food.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Four of us sat down and ordered Cabernet. After a few minutes the waiter stopped by to have us remind him what beer we had ordered... We placed our order for food and he brought out a \"family style\" salad. Bad lettuce with a couple of poor cut onions slices. There was 4 of us and they served the table of 2 next to us the same salad. We asked for me and the snotty waiter slammed a bowl of just lettuce on the table a few minutes later. The funny part was they give you a gallon of dressing per person.. We decided that since it was the new place in town we would order a few apps so that we could try it out. But, using some caution we stuck to the basics -- Calamari and Fried Zucchini. Both were dripping grease and had zero flavor what so ever. Luckily I had lots of the Lemom Basil dressing left from my salad to give the Calamari the citrus it needed (never been served Calamari without a lemon to squeeze on top). The Zucchini was so soaked in grease none of us could eat it. They didn't clear off the table so at this point we are overloaded and there was no room for the bread that was brought to the table. Unfortunately we made room for it and it was the most stale bread I have ever had. Perhaps I was mistaken and they brough us croutons to go with our lettuce?\nI'll wrap up with the entrees. I had ordered the \"lightly breaded\" veal chop with arugala and they served a disgusting piece of veal with a heavy and burned breading. No seasoning was involved. I opted for the starch and I was hoping it would be a pasta but instead if was a bowl of red skinned potatoes that had been given a butter bath. I literally poured the butter from the top before I could even tell what they had served me. I could have used these potatoes to apply wallpaper the place--gross. My wife was served cold, undercooked pasta and shrimp without any seasoning at all. It was supposed to be \"diablo\" but zero spice . She had two bites and was done. One guest ordered a side of chicken to go with his pasta and 5 minutes after his pasta was brought out they showed up with a bowl of shredded chicken.. a literal WTF moment.. The last meal was salmon and just to wrap this up was an awful piece of fish with no flavor -- same butter drenched gross potatoes..\n\nWe were honest with the waiter when he asked how everything was but he was more interested in being condescending in between smoke breaks. The manager does not have the skill level to deal with this type of complaint. She tried to make it better by taking the chicken off of the bill and offering a free desert.. And after all of this our bill was almost $200.... what a joke. I hope the place that goes in here next is better -- shouldn't be long.","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":1}

I have no problem paying for good food and if this food had been amazing, I wouldn't even mention the cost, but it's far from that. I normally get manicotti at Italian restaurants my first time there and maybe if I'd done that, I'd like this place more, but I doubt it, since there was barely any sauce with my crab ravioli and I didn't like the flavor. I know many people like bell peppers, but I'm not a fan. If I order crab ravioli, I expect to be able to taste the crab - the consistency of the crab was also very strange - it was mushy. My dad's linguine with red clam sauce barely had any sauce and the sauce that was there was SUPER runny - it looked more like died white clam sauce than red clam sauce. At least they used real clams, but neither of us were impressed. I wish Stone Pepper Grill hadn't closed.\n\nI'm REALLY not a fan of the Olive Garden, since there are so many better Italian places, but I think the food is better there, you get more, and it's certainly not as pricey...

I had to practically beg for parmesan cheese and what I got wasn't fresh or even nicely grated from a container...

Although they do have some drink specials and a pot of mussels for about 13-15 pounds. But once you start ordering appetizers or any of the other entrees, it can get pretty pricey pretty fast. I didn't think the mussels were anything out of the ordinary really -- and I was surprised to find cilantro all over mine (usually it's parsley when you order a shallot, butter, and white wine sauce). This wasn't on the menu so I had to try and pick the cilantro out. The one must-order here though I would say is the grilled scallops with butter appetizer. It's juicy, buttery, slightly sweet scallops on the shell -- and probably my favorite thing here.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We booked in advance, but the place wasn't terribly busy in the end. The atmosphere is quite formal and a bit quiet, rather than bustling and busy. I went for the red curry mussels, as did my husband - my parents got the traditional with shallots and cream. The servers gave us the wrong mussel pots which took us a while to figure out, as all the sauce collected at the bottom and wasn't really coating the mussels, so we honestly couldn't tell whose was whose initially. We had to take some of the huge portion of mussels out and put them to the side, so we had space to use our spoons to coat the remaining mussels in sauce. Once we managed that though, the mussels were very tasty and fresh. The sauces were mild, but added a nice subtle flavour to the dish. Sides were decent but basic - slightly soggy fries, steamed seasonal vegetables, nothing terribly exciting. The price can't be beat though, at £14 for an enormous meal.\n\nNot the most memorable of meals, but an enjoyable one. I think a loosening up of the atmosphere would go a long way.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Everything from the sounds of laughter or someone racking up a new game, to the smell of the velvet table tops mixed with tap beer and mixed drinks. Even the dimly lit room seemed all to familiar. I loved it.\n\nArriving later in the evening, my friends and I were unsure how long we would be playing for and didn't know if we wanted to pay the hourly rate of $15\/Hr (even though it was very reasonable). Upon expressing this to our server he recommended that we use the $1\/game table. What a deal!! With the average game of pool taking about 5-15 minutes why wouldn't we explore this affordable option?!\n\nSeveral libations later we had played 8 games over 2.5 hours, saving ourselves $37 by playing the $1 tables. We didn't even have this kind of deal when we were students!\n\nPool is not something I regularly play, however if I am ever in Ajax again with a hankering to play, I'll be sure to head back to Petrina's with a pocket full of change.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This is the kind of service we received from Elite A\/V over and over, when they said they were going to do something they did it and always on time.

They replied back to me within minutes saying it would probably be around $99.00 which I found acceptable and scheduled an appointment for the next day.  They arrived on time and explained that because the home theater system was so old they could not connect the new blue ray to it but could only connect it to the TV.   Since that was not a good option for me I declined and they were kind enough to not charge me for the service call.   I then thought about purchasing another home theater system but they suggested that I use the existing built in ceiling speakers.  I had originally not wanted to spend what I thought would be a lot of money to hook those up but after further discussions with Dylan I agreed this was the best route.   He was able to provide a receiver and sub-woofer for me or I could have went out and purchased my own.  I verified based on his quote and the cost was no more than what I would have paid at Best Buy.   We rescheduled for the next day for the install and again they were right on time.  Kevin and his partner came out and completed the installation in about 2  1\/2 hours talking us through the whole process.  They had to cut a small hole in the back of the entertainment center so they could attach the wires which I was at first not crazy about but it was very small and behind a closed door so it was a non-issue.

I called Elite A\/V after reading the yelp reviews.  I called because the picture on my smart TV would go black if I even moved the receiver a fraction of an inch. Also I couldn't get Netflix audio to play through my surround sound. I called the office around noon today and the technician, Dylan, was at my door at 4:00 pm. Dylan was as professional, courteous and knowledgeable as it gets. Within 10 minutes Dylan had run a new HDMI cable inside the wall, switched some connections and presto now Netflix audio was playing through my surround sound! All that was perfect but it got even better. I asked Dylan about television options outside of the cable companies. We talked about Roku for streaming various shows and channels. Dylan was kind enough to offer to come back another day and set me up with Roku at no extra charge (outside of the cost for the Roku itself) as he had only been there about 20 minutes out of the hour I was being charged. Well it turned out that Dylan had a new Roku in his truck and 30 minutes later Dylan had helped us set up an account and explained in detail how it worked. Dylan even loaded some free channels for us. I'm an older guy, in fact I think I have some socks older than Dylan but he was extremely patient and courteous in explaining everything. Now I can really reduce or even eliminate my Direct TV bill. Incredible! \nPlease use Elite A\/V for any home theater needs you may have.\nI can't recommend them any higher and can't thank Dylan enough for his assistance.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

A week later I followed up with them to see if they had come up with an estimate and was informed that they didn't have my contact information. When I finally did get the estimate it left off things we discussed and seemed a bit high, so I replied asking for clarification. Again a week went by with no reply until Jeremy contacted me to ask if I received their estimate, when I told him I had but had some questions and that I had replied to their original email asking for clarification. As we started to go over my questions I was informed that Chris was now out of town and Jeremy would have him contact me when he got back. Again a week went by with no contact until a third person called to follow up and see if I ever got the quote? I told the third person that I had and discussed it with Jeremy the prior week and I was still waiting to hear back from Chris, I was told he would follow up. As it turns out Chris did call a few minutes later but he didn't use my home number so his call went to voicemail. Never did talk with Chris but yet a fourth person called after another couple of days to follow up on the original quote. As I stated at the beginning they do appear very capable of doing a first rate job, but I will never know as their follow up to questions was basically nonexistent as their only real follow up was to ask for the job not answer any of my question and when we are looking at a $6,000 camera install, they could take a few minutes to answer questions. Reading all their reviews it does appear that I'm in the minority but I get the impression they really have very little internal communication or perhaps my job was just over their head, I'll really never know.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Professional, on time and really good to work with!  They made the entire process fun.  First, you can immediately tell that these guys know what they are doing - they've \"been there and done that.\"  They are personable, professional and make you feel at ease - whether you buy gear from them or have your own, you can be assured that they will treat you the same and give you top notch advice on both integration and installation.  Although it's always best to get the gear from them and what they recommend, if you already have your own, they'll still work with you - which is different than MOST companies who will refuse your work altogether.  This is why Elite is so great.  My project was by far NOT the biggest because I'm a geek and like to do a lot myself, but they didn't shy away.  They did the work with a fervor and completed it with just as much energy and enthusiasm as if it was an entire house automation system with $250k worth of gear.  If you choose another company to do your work, you are making a mistake.  They did ZERO damage, nothing was amiss, the place was treated with respect and they were laughing and joking with me the entire time making me feel comfortable.  They quoted me to install my projector and screen, but even spent time terminating a few sub cables I had and did a quick calibration on the projector just to ensure the screen was \"OK.\"  Who does that?  In Las Vegas, where everyone is out for the money, this is a company that is more interested in customer satisfaction and value.  I would work with them again in a heart beat.  Again, if you choose another company for your work - it's your mistake, don't say I didn't warn you!\n\nPS: When they make a recommendation, believe me - take it.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

So a few days ago, I received a call from a Product Advisor: Lisa Tu, asking me if I was interested in selling my 2013 Prius c back to them, and that they can compensate me, and give me some kind of offer on a new car.\n\nI've never been asked for a buy back, so I thought what's the harm, I thought I go and see what they were going to offer me.  At first nothing was laid out clearly, but we slowly got to see what the numbers were, because all I wanted to see was the numbers, that's all I wanted.  Lisa stepped out and I talked to the manager (indian) directly,  we talked for a while,  still couldn't get a confirmation on what the set monthly payment will be, he wanted me to say yes before giving me the final offer, then he started to get very impatient with me, I felt very uncomfortable\/pressured,  we ended the talk and that was that.\n\nBefore going home, I went over to the service department to chat with an advisor, I had some thing I wanted to ask him, then Lisa came back and started giving me better offers, now that I have the numbers, I see what I was actually into,  but I decided the better option of me was to keep the car that I have, and continue driving it.   Throughout the whole process, Lisa stayed really patient and professional, but I kept saying no and they kept giving me better offers.\n\nAt the end, I decided not to trade in for a new car, but Lisa still gave me a warm good bye, but another manager (caucasian) still trying to strike a deal, asking what would be a number I'm happy with, said he can tried to see if he can offer me a 90 days free of payment, I wasn't bluffing, I really was there to see what the offer was and decided I am better off with not trading my car, at the end he question me what I came the first place, which I did not appreciate.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend anyone looking for a toyota to talk to Product Advisor: Lisa Tu, but I would be very wary of the managers there, and do your research before going.  The indian manager told me toyota will still continue to offer the the prius c and prius v (wagon) for another two years, which I am not sure if he is just saying that to make a sale, or if it's confirmed.\n\nFrom my understanding, the prius c\/v will most likely not get replaced, and only the standard prius, and maybe later a plug in prius will be added to the line up.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I walked out happier than when i walked in and it was purely based on service received; not the cut price package of Pirate cookies that made it into my basket.\n\nThe store itself is medium sized but seems to pack pretty much everything in.

Nooooo! \n\nIn the Cleveland area, there's an endless supply of small, unique eateries that take the time to create and serve unique, tasteful, hand-crafted items with flavor. Hot Sauce Williams has created a great commodity in his BBQ sauce, however, ruins the spirit of Cleveland goodies by serving it over generic, tasteless, frozen bag items. \n\nGranted, my review is based off a Polish Boy sandwich combo. I haven't tried anything else and after trying the combo, I most likely won't make my way back to try anything else. \n\nG Love sang about it, so it can't be that bad, can it? Can the creator of such gems as 'Cold Beverages' and 'Milk and Cereal' really steer me in the wrong direction? He did, however, I'll forgive him with a listening of 'Baby's Got Sauce' (pun intended?). \n\nThe fries are actually store-bought Ore-Ida brand fries. I can remember being served those with dinner when I was a lad in the late 1980s. They are perfectly tasteless. The sauce drenches over them, adding taste, but it just seems incredibly lazy to take something I can easily buy in the store, increase the price, and serve it to customers.  \n\nThe buns are of exactly the same nature - walk in to any grocery store and purchase the cheapest hot dog buns they have - you'd be getting exactly what is served. \n\nThe sausage wasn't bad, had some taste and was of average size (I'd throw in a 'that's what she said,' but that phrase is so overused, I'll let it be). \n\nIt isn't terrible, but to be honest, without the sauce, there's no way Hot Sauce Williams would still be in business after all these years. The cute nickname helps, I'm guessing. I'm guessing a lot of people wouldn't keep returning to a \"Mr. Williams Barbecue Restaurant\" - so I guess the gimmick is working. Plus, it'd be totally cool of Williams decided to sponsor a MMA fighter, just so there'd be a fighter with the 'Hot Sauce' nickname. \n\nThe service is, well, non-existent. I asked for 'slaw on the side, and when I received my meal, my 'slaw was in the middle, which made the bun and accompanying fries soggy on the center and sides - they fell apart upon contact. The 'slaw is mostly liquid. I was reduced to eating a weird liquid mixture of Ore-Ida fries, juicy 'slaw, BBQ sauce and bread. \n\nSort of weird, they also give out cans of soda instead of fountain drinks. \n\nI'd buy a bottle of the sauce and use that at home, but I really wouldn't suggest eating here unless you're interested in a bland, sloppy mess of stuff you can grab at the nearest Piggly Wiggly (which, for Northerners, is probably pretty far away, so I'd have no clue why you'd travel that far to grab those simple ingredients).","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I have given this location two back to back chances and it was a disappointment on both occasions. \n\nThe place is defiantly a dive and not the cleanest. One our first visit on a Saturday night we ordered two 4 piece chicken dinners for my wife and I and one 2 piece chicken dinner for our daughter. We finally received our food after a 45 minute wait and the place was completely dead! The four piece chicken dinner comes with a breast, wing, thigh and drumstick, coleslaw, fries and BBQ sauce on the chicken & fries. Talk about a party in my mouth! The chicken was hot and juicy and cooked just right and seasoned to perfection! The fries and slaw were good also.\n\nThe employee's attitudes and customer service skills are in need of as much of a makeover as the dining space needs. The second time we went was the next day as we were on our way back home from Cleveland and got a 20 piece chicken to go. The girl at the cash register was on her phone the whole time I placed the order. I understand that it's a slow Sunday afternoon but, really?! She had a really foul attitude and just couldn't be bothered with taking orders. She was acting like actually pausing her phone conversation to take my order was a major inconvenience to her. \n\nIt took about 25 minutes to get our chicken the second time which is weird as I ordered a lot more chicken the second time. I would defiantly call ahead to place your order because if you wait on your food it WILL be a while.\n\nThe chicken is very good but, not worth the wait and dealing with the employee's bad attitudes.

Well, I love their food. Their service is very hit or miss.\n\nThough HSW is a bbq joint, I don't think it's necessarily their strongest point. The bbq sauce is really fantastic. The ribs and pulled pork are really good, but not really great. Granted, that's really comparing to at-home bbq using a smoker. When it comes to restaurants, you will be hard pressed to find better bbq in NE Ohio. And it's definitely better than other Ohio bbq chains like Carolina BBQ and City BBQ. \n\nWhere HSW really shines is their fried chicken and Po Boy and Po Girl. The fried chicken is easily some of the best fried chicken I've ever had - crisp skin, cooked to perfect doneness. But if you go to HSW, be sure to get a Po Boy or Po Girl. What's the exact difference? I don't remember. The better one is the one with a hot sausage in a bun topped with pork shoulder, french fries, coleslaw, and french fries (I think that's the po girl). I cannot eat it with my hands, because it falls apart. If you can eat it without utensils, then give yourself 100 extra Man Points (c). Unfortunately, I dont get to make it to HSW very often, so I've not been able to try their fried fish or several other foods.\n\nFor drinks, they have soda machines and HUGs (kool aid in a tiny barel). Last time I was there, they didn't have a soda machine, so no free refills, which is a bummer\n\nThough I love the food and their pink & blue color scheme outside, I think they only hire terrible people to work the registers. I've literally never eaten there and experienced a cashier that wasn't rude. They not only seemed to hate me on a personal level, but were offended by my audacity of ordering food there. With that being said, the cooks and individuals handing out the food have always been very sweet and friendly. Also, there was an employee my first visit there who helped me open a stuck bathroom door, and he was really great. I'm confused as to why the cashiers have been awful. Granted, I haven't been to HSW in well over a year since I moved out of state, so perhaps their cashiers are less butthurt now.\n\nIf I remember correctly, all locations are not places you want to be late and night by yourself with obvious fistfuls of cash (if ya catch my drift), so if you're an easily scared white person, go for lunch. Also, they used to only accept cash - not sure if that's changed.\n\nIf you're looking for a local restaurant and would like some soul food or bbq, I very highly recommend HSW. Also, the Carnegie location is right down the road from the Cleveland Clinic main campus. So, if you have an appointment with your cardiologist or nutritionist or whatever, you may as well stop by for some lunchtime fried perch and peach cobbler after your appointment.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Thank you.\n\nWell, let me tell you.  I love he food here!  However, I had a costly-to-owner and manager, and a terrible experience today (well, the 12th a Wednesday), and they need to know if they want to keep customers!!!  Who knows how many people just walk out because of the rude and slow staff - I'm sure they do it all the time and just don't tell the boss.  Here is what I am trying to communicate, and I can find no other way.  Website non-existent.\n \nMy would-be communique:\nYou lost 3 customers in a row today, August 12, at about 4:30, including the 2 ahead of me and then me.  I would have spent around $20.  The two were mother and son, and who knows what a growing boy eats?!  \nThe 2 in front of me (no one else in line or the restaurant) waited and waited even to be acknowledged let alone waited on.  There were 3 employees - a man and 2 women -who saw clearly we were there.  The customers and I chatted pleasantly for a good 5 minutes.  They got tired of waiting - for anything.  They left.  I was now the only customer.  One would think that their seeing 2 walkouts would have prompted them to action!  \nThe 3 of them stood directly in front of me at the register!  They did everything to pretend I wasn't there.  Could they not have said \"we'll be right with you\"?  Totally ignored me and instead counted tickets and chit-chatted about.  There was plenty of food, so they were in no crunch.  I'd have spent $20 - LOSS.  Mother and son, who knows? - LOSS.  I go to your place because it's usually great and I am a frequent Clinic visitor.\nFrankly, I would fire all three of these employees if I were you.  You've got a great business, but who knows how many customers walk out.  RUDE EMPLOYEES might be chasing away more than you know.  \nSusan Bednar","useful":14,"funny":1,"cool":0}

A year ago I would recommend anyone visiting Cleveland to come here.  NOT AFTER TODAY!!  I used to LOVE going here!  The Polish boy was one my personal favorites.  Today, I was on my way home and just happened to come by Hot Sauce Williams so I pulled in.  I knew I would have to wait at the drive thru but ...WOW!  15 minutes??  I should have just parked my car and went in.  Drive Thru is a BAD IDEA at this establishment.  I pulled up to the speaker and a piece of cardboard was over the speaker and written in marker saying \"STOP! Order here!\" I ordered and I will come to find out that the prices on their outside menu are WRONG and MORE EXPENSIVE than listed! (I didn't know this but I will explain later). On top of that, it looks like the window covering the menu and prices has not been cleaned since 2012. I ordered the Polish Boy combo and small size fried okra.  I had a couple in front of me and waited approximately 5 minutes before I arrived at the window ( I made a mental note changing radio stations because when I arrived at the window it took longer than the entire song of Baltimora 'Tarzan Boy' as I kept changing stations to pass times and ended back on the 80's channel to hear the end of that song and start a new one).  Do not think of this place as a typical 'fast food' drive thru.  You order and you will WAIT but they don't tell you that which can be a good thing.  This can give you the impression that the food is fresh but to tell you the truth, it didn't seem like it was 'fresh' in least bit.  In fact, it appeared that they took care of of whoever was inside BEFORE the drive thru customers because I actually watched 3 polish boys being made while I waited for my single polish boy because I guess the people inside took priority and they had only ONE person making food with 3 other people handling money and passing out beverages.  While watching someone else's food being prepared another employee came to the window and gave me my ridiculous total of $11.98!!  I gave her my money and at first I just simply thought the tax was high so I asked why my total was $11.98?  Apparently the prices listed on their dusty and dirty outside menu board are WRONG!  The RUDE employee didn't tell me anything.  She just \"handed\" me a receipt.  Instead of the okra being $2.75 it was $3.99!  I told the lady this and she just said, \"It is?  I will have to change that.\"  She walked away and I NEVER saw her again. Well, what about you OVERCHARGING??  I was already upset waiting for food so I turned my car off to save gas until I arrived at the window. I was overcharged and the lady avoiding me now, had another employee hand me my beverage. Coke in a can. As I was saying my food was over charged, she closed the window!! WHAT!! This is how you deal with customers with issues!?!? You AVOID them! \n     Finally I received my food.  They had ANOTHER employee hand me the food and this worker was a male.  I was actually able to talk with him and say that I was overcharged. He was not helpful or even courteous in ANY way! He said, \"I can't help you, I don't work with the menu.\" I kept telling him, this was WRONG, you can't overcharge customers and you can't treat people like this! Again, like a robot, \"I can't help you with that.\"  I heard enough. \"If you can't fix this or help and NONE of you are willing to help without me making a scene then I'm DONE with ALL of you!\" He replied again, \"I can't help you\" and shut the window then walked away while all the other employees avoided the window. \n     I'M NEVER RETURNING TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT!! What happened?? The employees don't care! A year ago this was a decent place! They even have photos of Robin Williams (I miss him so much!) visiting there with his family.  What happened? I don't know and I WISH I could give this place more stars but this whole experience was enough for me to give them the LOWEST rating. I had a few good times here in the past with some memorable moments but it will ALWAYS be overlooked by this horrible treatment! THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS TREATMENT AND ATTITUDE! Even the food changed in my opinion. My Polish Boy was a regular sized hot dog with fries and coleslaw slapped on top of it and my fried okra was soggy.  Worst of the all, the sauce was different this time too. It was watered down and tasted old if that's possible. I WILL NOT RETURN.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I went into the Coach store and they offer many bags not found anywhere else so it was a nice store. It's nice to grab an ice cream cone and walk around to people watch and window shop, then return to reality! Fashion mall was great alternative with things I can actually afford :)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

So, gents, let me explain why this is actually happening and to have a successful \/ fun \/ enjoyable afternoon with your lady in Las Vegas. \n\nStep 1: Regardless of where you're staying, suggest to them \"Today I think we should stop by one of the casino bars after breakfast and have some champagne. Then we'll game for a half hour or so after which we'll walk through the Palazzo and do some shopping\" - at which point she'll agree because you said the magic word: SHOPPING!\n\nStep 2: Enact the plan - head down to the casino bar and ply her with mimosas or bellinis or whatever...so long as it has champagne in it, you're golden. Have a couple yourself. Gamble. Casually announce that you're off to do some shopping.\n\nStep 3: Amble your way along to the Palazzo - if you come in through the front then walk through the casino, stop at a gelato shop, etc. Make it enjoyable. \n\nStep 4: Upon arriving at the Palazzo your jaw will drop (yes, even you, lowly non shopping gents) at the staggering displays therein. And so will your lovely lady's jaw drop. Stop at a couple stores and then announce that you need a refill. \n\nStep 5: Stop at the Double Helix Wine Bar and collect glasses of wine for your and your date \/ significant other.\n\nStep 6: Tag along while they shop. You're now pleasantly buzzed and you'll find you don't hate it. \n\nStep 7: While shopping you'll invariably find something that (a) costs a little less than what she was expecting and (b) costs a bit more than what you were expecting. BUY IT. \n\nStep 8: The remainder of your trip to Vegas will be the best time of your life and you can pretty much do anything.\n\nThere you have it guys...I just showed you how to have THE BEST trip to Vegas with your lady \/ significant other. \n\nPS: You can use this unlimited times and your gal will ALWAYS want to go back to Vegas then.","useful":0,"funny":3,"cool":1}

Wir sind schon öfter an dieser Pizzeria vorbeigegangen und ich habe über den Namen etwas die Nase gerümpft - Regenbogen, das klingt so nach schlechter 80er Jahre Taverne.\n\nDrinnen ist es dann im ersten Eindruck auch ein bisschen, wie bei einer kleinen Zeitreise - allerdings nicht in die 80er, sondern in die 90er, in die mich gerade die Lampen und die Einrichtung zurückversetzten. Was ich aber sehr charmant fand, waren die Theaterfotografien an den Wänden.\n\nBeim Service war ich am Anfang etwas verunsichert, weil der gute Herr wirklich finster gucken konnte, aber das verbesserte sich im Laufe des Abends merklich und jeder, der an unseren Tisch kam war immer höflich und professionell. Außerdem waren Getränke und Speisen immer unverzüglich an unserem Tisch, auch als es später am Abend sehr voll wurde - so lob ich mir das.\n\nDas Essen war dann ein wahres Gedicht, angefangen beim Brotkorb mit frisch gebackenen Pizzabrötchen bis hin zur Nachspeise, was wieder zeigt, dass man sich nicht von Äußerlichkeiten abschrecken lassen darf. \nAuf der gemischten Vorspeisenplatte fanden wir ein Gedicht an italienischer Salami und Schinken sowie exzellentem Käse. Mein Bruschetta war ein frisch gebackener halber Pizzafladen mit frischen Tomatenstückchen, die ordentlich mit Knoblauch garniert waren - sehr lecker!\nDie Hauptgerichte haben uns dann absolut überzeugt: Ich hatte frische Nudeln von der Tageskarte mit Steinpilzen. Die Nudeln waren einen winzigen Tacken zu al dente für meinen Geschmack, aber sie zogen noch etwas nach. Die Steinpilze in der Soße mit frischen Kräutern waren hervorragend. \nAber das absolute Highlight war die Pizza: wie in Italien. Hauchdünner, geschmacklich hervorragender, knuspriger, aber nicht trockener Teig mit leckerem Mozzarella, der ordentlich Fäden zieht und frischem Belag, der die anderen Zutaten nicht erstickt. Ich bin sonst von Pizza nicht so leicht zu beeindrucken, aber diese war einfach ein Gedicht.\nDer Tiramisu zum Nachtisch musste dann noch sein, obwohl wir eigentlich schon satt waren. Er hat den hervorragenden Eindruck des Essens noch unterstrichen.\n\nAuch der Wein war hervorragend und mit 4,50 Euro für 1\/4 Liter auch nicht besonders teuer. Insgesamt war das Preis-Leistung-Verhältnis (9 Euro für die Pizza, 10,50 Euro für die Nudeln) für die Qualität absolut angebracht.\n\nEiner meiner Lieblingsitaliener in Stuttgart, wenn es mal eher gemütlich als schick sein soll.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2}

Staff are still growing into their roles, but friendly. Good for dressy dates, business meetings, and hopefully drinks on the patio when the weather is warmer! \n\nIt's a shame that this shiny new part of Cleveland doesn't get the traffic it deserves after the boom that was Summer 2016. Getting here is about a 10 min walk from the RTA station, but at night, when there's hardly anyone around, and your phone light is shining brighter than the streetlights... The empty buildings can be pretty eerie. Buuut, I guess I can't complain about having my pick of the reservation times during Downtown Restaurant Week. \n\nThe Burnham can be entered directly from the side of the Hilton building, and my friend and I were pretty impressed by the upscale nautical wall deco. Everything still looked as though the plastic wrap had just been taken off. We were shown in short order to our table, a half-booth ordeal. Normally I'm all about the booth tables, but our booties sank a little too deep into the plush seat and made the table an awkward height to lean your arms on. Which, if you have just above can't-take-you-ANYWHERE etiquette like me, you tend to do quite often. Anyways. We were brought some complimentary bread and olive oil while looking through our menus, but the server nearly dropped the bread on the table instead of our plates, and the bread was quite plainly not fresh. A rough start. \n\nOur hearts and stomachs dropped a little when we saw our first appetizer (not part of the Prix Fixe menu), five tiny Garlic & Onion Beignets. This was definitely not Southern hospitality. They were pretty good, but gone too soon, including the pickle garnish. Each of us then chose different salads for the first course and were pleasantly surprised by the unique ingredients. No plain Caesar from the grab bag - mine had a crunchy mix of greens, pickles, sunchoke, and a light dressing. Main course involved a Swordfish Schnitzel for me, and a Sous Vide Fried Chicken for her. You heard right. Schnitzel and sous vide, chicken and swordfish? Did they draw these combos out of a hat? Maybe, but they work surprisingly well together - both meats were tender, the accompanying sides (radish + mashed potatoes for me) appropriately balancing. I could probably have done with less salt overall, but know that you'll be leaving full after an entree. The desserts were cute trays of Petit Fours, including cake pops and macarons. Nothing mind-boggling, but easy to pack up and eat on the go. \n\nLike others have said, service was fairly slow. It took a while for our dishes to come and for water to be refilled even though we were one of probably five tables that evening. The staff is definitely rough around the edges compared to the establishment (I mean, have you SEEN the bathrooms? Go, just go outside across the hallway, and enjoy the gilded glory.). It's not a place you should expect to grab a quick bite - although I think I spotted a kid eating chicken tenders a few tables over. But food-wise, we felt we got what we paid $30 (+ an appetizer) for. The menu, the staff, the booty-sucking seats, it all feels a little experimental, but I think we got some positive results out of the evening.","useful":4,"funny":4,"cool":3}

Chose this restaurant because our party had been to most restaurants in Cleveland and the Burnham had only been open 16 days when we ate there.  \n\nOurs was a party of four and had no time constraints so we decided to do a couple courses of splitting the small plates.  After our incredible waiter Joseph walked us through some of his favorite things and some of the background for some of the food, we chose our first course as Octopus salad, soft shell crab special, chilaquiles, shrimp and grits, and fried rice.  All of these dishes were as advertised and devoured by our party.  The octopus salad was some of the most tender, tasty octopus we have had anywhere in the country let alone Cleveland.  The chilaquiles were like a mexican pancake with pulled pork and rock shrimp baked in.  The shrimp and grits were great.\n\nOur second course we chose soul bowl (mac and cheese with pork belly and collard greens), boudin and mash (blood sausage and mashed potatoes), confit wings, and the five cheese pizza.  While I don't like collard greens, the mac and cheese and huge pieces of pork belly was good.  The blood sausage and mashed potatoes were a british\/irish delicacy and delight.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were great.  The confit wings were a bit salty but they literally fell off the bone and were served with a green sauce that I can't quite figure out what it was.  The pizza was great topped with tomato and basil and quite flavorful.\n\nOur party had a couple bottles of wine from the extensive wine list and some of their cocktails (Sacre Bleu and French 75).  The cocktails were all made from scratch and delicious.\n\nThe staff at this restaurant were incredible with multiple people from servers, hosts, back kitchen staff, and managers all making their way to our table to wish one a Happy Birthday and welcome us to the restaurant.

Nothing crazy but just a nice simple home cooked meal while traveling -- something we all crave. \n\nThe Sous Vide chicken was well prepared, maybe just a touch over done, and the creamy mash and broccolini were nice accompaniments. While the broccolini was a tad under-salted, the mashed potatoes were a bit over-salted so I ate them together and it was perfect. I can handle that.

His push for the featured Mitchell's Banana Pudding ice cream was a win, especially with his flexibility in swapping out the vanilla ice cream on the chocolate angel food cake dessert dish. Yum!\n\nAll in all, I think the restaurant offers good value, a fun vibe, and it's awesome that you can go for pre- or post-dinner drinks at the 32 Bar (rooftop)!\n\nFinal thing: I loved their dining chairs. Upholstered and so comfortable. It may sound silly but chairs make a huge difference! I felt relaxed the whole time.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I was told by the gentleman who answered the phone that he needed manager approval for that many people, and put me on hold. I waited a few minutes, and when he returned he informed me that he couldn't find a manager but would take down my information and someone would call me back. I waited 24 hours and didn't hear from anyone, so I called back. I explained that I had called the day before and needed to speak to a manager, and was placed on hold for ELEVEN MINUTES before I finally hung up. I called back for a third time and immediately asked to speak to a manager, by which the person responded rudely \"well can I take a message, we are a little busy right now.\" I said \"no, you may not take a message, I need to speak with a manager immediately.\" I was placed on hold AGAIN, this time for more than five minutes. I FINALLY got a manager, Franc, on the phone who didn't even bother apologizing for my troubles. \n\nOn Wednesday I get a call from the restaurant (two days after my first attempt to make a reservation) telling me they couldn't accommodate my party.

We were seated next to the bar so had the chance to interact with their bartender who made the experience even better. Super friendly guy, very knowledgeable mixologist--everything he made was great.

We ordered several small plates to start with: calamari, pierogis, and octopus. Everything was delicious and the preparations were creative and unlike what we've had at other restaurants. We especially loved the sauce on the pierogis and the octopus was so good we wound up getting another order. For dinner, we tried Oxtail, Burnham Burger, and Shrimp & Grits.

I was out with my son and we came across this place. It looks like a new place trying to look old. So, the name is perfect. The layout reminded me a lot like sonic and the drive ins back when I was really young. The interior is really nice and I thought they did a great job of decorating.\n\nI ordered the Banzai dog and my son ordered the White hot dog. We also decided to get a large order of fries to split and my son got a root beer. We went there about a week ago and my son is still talking about how magnificent the root beer was. He also loved the hot dog, but said it might have been a little salty. I thought that the banzai dog was also fantastic. The banzai sauce is really what makes it. You could put that on just about anything and make it taste good. Plus, its covered with bacon.. \n\nWhenever I order fries and I see that they are fresh cut fries, my brain automatically thinks Malt Vinegar. I grabbed one of the containers and took it back to our seat. We were seated along the windows so when the light hit the container, something caught my eye. It looked like there were 2-3 ants floating in the bottom of the container. I took the container back to the counter and gave it to the person there and showed them, told them I thought they were ants. Then I noticed all of the vinegar containers had this substance in them. I went back to my seat and a few minutes later the manager shows up with a pan, in which she had poured out the vinegar in to show me they were not ants. She explained that it was a fatty spongy substance that collects in vinegar containers. I told her that I have several different vinegar containers at home, some that I have had for 2+ years and I have never seen this substance. I She said it is common and found it on the internet. So of course I asked the obvious question, \"How long has that vinegar been in those containers that it would have this fatty spongy substance?\" She told me that they empty them every week and refill them. Now, I know I look like I just fell off the yam wagon, but I find it hard to believe that your vinegar forms that in a week and mine hasn't in over 2 years. My ten-year-old was able to ascertain that you were full of crap so needless to say, your excuse needs work. I wasn't asking for a free meal, just say \"Geeze, that's gross.. let me get you a new one.\" \n\nRegardless of the vinegar incident and the manager clearly trying to cover her ass, I thought the place was great. I will probably return again if I am in the area, but I think I will skip the fries and vinegar.","useful":3,"funny":4,"cool":3}

As an ovo-lacto vegetarian (I eat eggs and dairy products), I am never sure if somewhere that specializes in hot dogs will have any options for me, but RETRO Dog has not one but three vegetarian entrees--a veggie dog, a veggie Italian sausage, and a black bean burger. They also offer veggie chili, veggie coney sauce, and veggie cheese fries.\n\nI had a veggie dog with veggie coney sauce and cole slaw and a side of onion rings. The dog had a pleasant texture and flavor and the toppings were scrumptious. I have tried quite a few veggie dogs in my day and this was definitely one of the best. The onion rings were unlike any other rings I have tried. The batter had an interesting flavor and was not crumbly like many other rings, but it was crisp and delicious. I also enjoyed the zesty sauce that accompanied the rings.\n\nI chose the locally-brewed root beer for my beverage and I was not disappointed. The flavor was mellow and not overly sweet and it was served in a fancy chilled mug. \n\nMy dining companions ordered a veggie Italian sausage, a RETRO Dog, a Red Hot, and a couple other meat dogs and everyone was satisfied. We also happened to go on a buy one, get one free hot dog day, which was a pleasant surprise for the pocket book. \n\nWe chose to eat inside, rather than utilizing the Swenson's-style carports. They looked fine, if that's your thing. The atmosphere inside is a fun mix of retro kitsch and contemporary.

Kind of separate from anything else, you will see a large take out with parking out front where you can have the food brought out to your car or go in to the cool dining area.

The menu consists of hot dogs, sandwiches, sides and plenty of ice cream based desserts.  \n\nI have had the veggie retro dog, the fries, onion rings and a couple of milk shakes, overall the food is good, not great.  The veggie retro dog is a pretty nice veggie hot dog with veggie coney sauce, mustard and onions on a wheat bun.  The mild hot dog has a nice snap but it could have used more of the toppings, especially the coney sauce, which is a mild veggie chili.  The french fries are fresh cut, but were not terribly crisp.  The onion rings missed the mark with the fried batter overpowering the flavor of the onions and they seemed a bit overcooked.\n\nThe 2 milkshakes I tried were the best items I had at Retrodog; prepared fresh with soft serve ice cream.  The flavor selection is extensive and they have some unique flavors for you to try.  The chocolate banana was a nice balance of the banana milk shake with hot fudge; the salted caramel was a nice balance of sweet with a hint of salt.

This was going to be a 3-star review until after I finished eating, turned on my lights, waited 15 minutes, then had to CALL them to come out and take my money. The young man really was giving good curb service until the end. He was very apologetic, but come on, he saw my lights on as did another young man. They took care of 3 other cars and ignored me.

You know, just for a snack.\n\nFor some reason, I was feeling adventurous that day.  I went against my instincts and, at the recommendation of Liana E, I went with the veggie dog.  I got mine topped simply with just the special mayo mustard.  I also went, of course, with a cup of the locally brewed root beer.  I debated the growler when I saw them on the counter, but it seemed a bit pricey (I think it was $15 for the growler full of root beer).\n\nI took my cup and dog to go, but really just sat outside at one of the tables since it was such a nice day.  I unwrapped my dog and was surprised at it's size - bigger than I expected.  This was going to be more than a snack.  I took a bite.  And instantly my brain thought, \"This doesn't taste like a hot dog.\"  Then I remembered, duh, I ordered the veggie dog.  The taste was not unpleasant to my meat-loving sensibilities.  And the special mayo mustard, which I think was just mayo mixed with dijon mustard, had a nice flavor to it.  Though I'm not sure it was the best condiment for the veggie dog.  The root beer was aces.  I still regret not splurging on that growler.\n\nI've vowed to return to the area and I'd like Retro Dog to be part of it.  If I enjoyed the veggie dog so much, I can only imagine how much I'd like the meat hot dogs.  I also saw some amazing looking onion rings I'd like to give a try as well as some tasty looking desserts.  Seems like my kind of place.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":2}

The best 2 things about the one on the strip, they are open 24 hours and they sell beer.  What can make this place better? Well, it is also attached to a casino! The place was hoping and cranking out burgers at a rapid rate.  If you haven't tried White Castle, now is your time.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They sell their signature miniature \"slider\" sized burgers at an overpriced rate. This seems to be the selling gimmick for White Castle, luring in drunk gamblers or curious tourists to stop in. \n\nThe restaurant itself is attached to the casino of the Venetian I believe. It is located on the Strip, with a one door entry point. A long line of hungry customers fills the restaurant, although it moves rather quickly. There are only 5-6 tables, with 2 larger bar-stool type tables for seating. As you reach closer to the register, you are welcomed with a better view to the behind-the-scenes look of White Castle. Rapid hands swiftly assemble buns amongst grilled onions and juicy meat patties, exchanging between different work stations to finally end up placed in a singular order, ready for the customer. \n\nA large glass window display showcases some of the White Castle souvenirs that are available to purchase to take home. A $10 coffee cup or a $25 T-shirt? Not for me but maybe for others. \n\nLast, but certainly not least, was the food. If you're familiar with the case and recognition of White Castle, then eating at the actual location only provides a slightly more fresh experience than the frozen, store-bought burgers. The buns are much softer and are squishy to the touch. The taste and aroma of the grilled onions complement the meat patty. It's White Castle, there isn't much too glorify about it or expect. \n\nMy experience was pleasant, but to each their own. For $8.99 you can get 4 Cheese Sliders, a small fry and a small drink. The price is consistent with the glamorization of the branding. I ate each slider in about 2 bites and was still hungry afterwards, but didn't want to face waiting in a long line again. \n\nIf you are nearby in the area, take a look!","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

(Service-wise). The food is relatively standard-ware. I came and waited in line with 3 of my friends on an afternoon, and waited about 20 minutes in line to place my order. I understand that places get busy, so it was acceptable.\n\nHowever, after about 30 minutes of waiting for our orders, my friends all got their orders, but I still had not yet received mine. I inquired several times about my order, and where it was in the queue. My friends finished eating, and we kept waiting around.\n\nEach time I asked, the person handing out the food would promptly dismiss me, and even the manager bluntly and rudely told me they serve hundreds of burgers a day, and it would come out soon enough. \n\nAlso note - my order number was 374, but they kept on calling order 274 out. I asked if they perhaps had my order ready, but they told me no, they had Order 274 ready, and that it was not my order.\n\nNow, about 1.5 hours after entering the restaurant, and an hour after placing my order, I demanded that they finally look inside the bag, and the manager who had been extremely rude finally conceded that they had mislabeled my order.\n\nInstead of offering anything to help make it better, they only offered me a brownie, which means that they valued wasting about an extra hour of my time at ~2 dollars.\n\nIf they had merely checked the queue the first time I asked, no problems would have occurred, and we could have resolved all the issues. Instead, this Whitecastle decides to run as if the customer is always wrong, and will stonewall and lie to you about your order.\n\nOnce a mistake is also made, they will make a measly effort to fix their problems.\n\nI strongly recommend you go elsewhere for a burger fix in Vegas.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Friends say that they were once plentiful, but I understand that they have retreated to the comfort of the east coast. Save this one. This White Castle is all alone out here in Vegas. So, it was on my list of things to see and experience in Las Vegas. I'd never had one. Not even from the grocery store. I'd even seen all three of the Harold & Kumar movies about them. I was super excited. Well done White Castle!  \n    So, I parked my ride back at the LINQ self parking, and hiked down this way to get to the Treasure Island for the Pirate ship battles and the Marvel thingy. It was quite of a hike to thie point. Several times I pondered giving up and taking the Monorail. But I persevered, and this was a well deserved stopping point. The Las Vegas strip is deceptively long.  \n     As I entered there was a bit of a line at the counter when I walked in. The sounds of the nearby casino jingled and buzzed and tempted through a huge opening in one wall. I assume the White Castle is open at all hours to collect the hungry gamblers. Which is probably alot, as the smell of burgers wafted across my nose as I looked up at the great big menu to figure out what I wanted. Looking at the items, the prices ranged within your usual 'fast food prices'.\n     There was a range of options. Meat, other Meat. Fake Meat. No Meat. All the glutens, none of the glutens. Even Vegetarian and probably Vegan options. I saw a sign for a double cheeseburger combo (little teeny ones) and decided that's what I wanted. I wound my way through the line and got to a register, and ordered one from the nice lady behind the counter.\n    I was given a cup and a receipt. I took both to find a place to sit. Easier said than done. This place was pretty popular. Eventually I found one at a high common table. I set my camera bag and phone on the table corner to mark it as being taken. As I went over to get an iced tea, I heard my number called. I altered my trip back to my table, and veered back over towards the counter to pick up my tray of food. I was excited, I was eager. I was going to try White Castle burgers. I reached into my bag and withdrew the three small boxes inside. \n    Hrm. These three tiny things are supposed to fill up me? Seriously? Hrm. Ok. After the yelp photo, I carefully pulled out the miniscule burgers, doing my best to save the buns from ripping. I excitedly took a bite of one. It was okay? I was not as awed and amazed as Harold and Kumar were. I wasn't overwhelmed and taken away on a meaty dream sequence of awesomeness. I was just kinda sorta whelmed.\n    Even the iced tea was that fountain done stuff. Not brewed iced tea. Meh. I'd have rather been eating a Carl's Jr. Big Carl. But. I'd finally experienced it. Checked it off my list. That's part of the excitement of life I suppose. To get out there and try new things. Sometimes they're just not as great as the commercials.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

What makes this joint stand out is everything else in addition to the location.  The burgers grill on a flat top coated with onions to soak in flavor.  They are simply made with a couple leftover onions and a pickle, plus cheese if you pay extra.  No frills needed, or really requested for that matter.  The other options I tried were pretty basic type fast food, so nothing special I would go back for.\n\nThis location is 24\/7 right on the Vegas strip and whether it was noon after a night of drinking, or 4am during a night of drinking - this place is gold! 4 bite burgers that are pretty cheap, freshly made in front of you and aren't super heavy.  I chowed down on 5 of them easily feeling satisfied without feeling sick the next day or really even feeling regret from eating anything overly greasy or poor quality.\n\nIn a regular fast food setting it would be just that to me.

Seriously.  What in the world did you expect?  \n\nAs far as taste goes, White Castle is not for some.  I can't hate on people not liking it if it's their first time.  I'm also well aware there are FAR more better burgers available, but sometimes you just want a White Castle that is cooked unlike any other burger.  \n\nThe burger tasted like I expected, and the cashier, who I'm sure wanted to rip her own head off, was a sweetheart.  Being the lines were so crazy, I asked her if anybody in her team had walked out yet, and she said \"we're soldiers!\".  I loved her attitude, and I wish I had remembered her name.  My gripe, and why it's 3 stars, is with their pricing.  I know it's a strip joint, but there are other chains that charge their regular prices on the strip.  A few steps down is a Chipotle and a McDonald's that charges the same as any other one of their locations.  I don't care that rents are higher on the strip and it's their only location.  Whenever they come into town...locals CRAM THEIR FOOD TRUCKS for their burgers.  They could have just as easily chosen an off-strip location and made a killing off of us.  I split a Crave Pack that came with 10 hamburgers (we paid extra for cheese), 20 chicken rings, and 2 regular fries.  Large sodas ($2.99) were separate.  The bill came out to $38.88.  I'm sorry, but $19.50 for 5 cheeseburgers, 10 chicken rings, fries, and a soda is lame.  For $20, I can come up with 50 other places I rather eat at.  \n\nAlso, they offer a combo that comes with 3 cheeseburgers and regular fries for 8.77...WITHOUT A SODA.  That's just wrong considering fountain soda usually has the highest markup of any of their items.  They could've easily included the soda.  \n\nI won't be going back, but I'm hoping that they'll open up some off-strip locations and possibly offer the pricing that other White Castles are used to offering...because at the end of the day...this is White Castle, not Five Guys (or any other burger joint of your choice).","useful":21,"funny":6,"cool":4}

We even offer to pay for them.\n\nThe patience paid off and we went home with 14 sliders and fries for free!\n\nThe customer service was amazing.

I was sure to place my order as quickly as possible (we ordered the #2 cheeseburger, fries, and drink), so at least the cashier appeared to merely tolerate me as I paid. This place has only been open a few weeks and the employees at the front are already burnt out. What's up with that? With so much unemployment in Vegas, couldn't they have found a few cashiers who are a bit friendlier?\n\nAs for the food - well, it's White Castle. It is what it is. Tiny, thin burger in a plain bun, with a bit of cheese and onion. There's a burger in there, but can anyone really taste it? I estimate the ratio of bun to burger is about 8:1, so you'll have to eat a huge amount of bun before you get much burger in your tummy! The fries were just bleh.\n\nAbout the location - I'm not sure where to park to get into this place. There is no parking in front, so we ended up parking in the Venetian and walking back to the Strip, but surely there's a spot closer than that? Also, there were TWO security guards working this location, which only amplified the negative vibes in this place. And our table was damaged enough that it made eating uncomfortable - such a shame at such a new location.\n\nNot recommended.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Of course the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art could never compete in the sizes of those museums, but the prices should reflect the quality and quantity of artwork.

This in itself raises an interesting question.  What is the \"value\" and \"worth\" of admission of an art exhibit to a person?  Do 3 paintings justify the price?  30 paintings?  Do the artists showcased play a factor?\n\nGranted, I took advantage of a \"Free Admission\" day, so I didn't pay the requisite $15 dollars.  It's only 4 rooms, so it took less than an hour to complete, but I did see some beautiful pieces there from the \"Figuratively Speaking: A Survey of the Human Form\" exhibit.  Some from Lichtenstein, and Nara, and Picasso, Degas, and Renoir.  Certainly, viewing the works of these artists has to be worth something.\n\nAnd it's not like the gallery doesn't change its exhibit at least twice a year.  The staff was friendly enough and didn't follow you room to room; an issue that I had at another (now closed) museum here.  There are locals and student discounts.  It comes with a free audio tour.\n\nSo what is the price of viewing art worth to you?  If you like the artists and get a chance to see their works in person, shouldn't that be at least worth some value to yourself?  I've been to bigger and admittedly better museums, but I did enjoy my time here.\n\nWhen the exhibits change, I'd be glad to come back.

Fortunately, my husband can occasionally get us in for free so that's when we go. Like this past weekend, for example. \n\nThe current exhibit, which runs through January 2012, is \"A Sense of Place.\" But the sense I got was that they just threw some paintings together to try to fit a theme. I'm sure if you are an art major you would totally disagree with me; but for the general public, the art seems to be chaotically set up. \n\nIt starts off with paintings from the mid- to late-1800's and they fit the theme: a painting of Venice, a painting of a French countryside. Next thing you know, you are looking at a sketch from Christo and Jean-Claude (who did The Gates in Central Park a few years ago) from the 1960's. It was quite a jump in the evolution of art. Well no matter, I figured, since the next dozen paintings were from the late 1900's and still (mostly) fit the theme. Walked into the next room and what do you know? A painting by Monet and a photo of a golf course from a couple years ago. Like I said, it seemed chaotically set up. \n\nThe last room was probably the worst; not in terms of the art itself, but just the fact that it didn't really seem to fit the theme or a logical order. There was a sculpture of a cloud....which I *guess* you can say is a \"Sense of Place\" and then a pop art piece by Lichtenstein and then some other stuff I've (sadly) already forgot. \n\nI really really really want this town to have a decent for-reals museum like other cities. One where you feel like a $15 entry is worth the price. And I really don't want to be so harsh on this place since we need some culture in this town and this is one of the few places to get it. Again, the paintings themselves are great to look at....they just seem to be haphazardly thrown together so you are left scratching your head. \n\nA few years ago, we saw the Ansel Adams exhibit at Bellagio and I would have probably given that 4-stars. It was very memorable and I learned a lot from it. This exhibit however... I don't think it justifies the price tag. Maybe if there was a more logical order to the pieces and if the audio guides had more detail I could have bumped it up to 3 stars.

I don't ride a scooter holding a cigarette and oxygen tank.  I don't wear an upside-down over-sized visor while clutching a yard-long margarita.  I don't go to clubs in my shiny shirt.  And I don't get my perv on at the topless pools.  I have absolutely nothing against those activities, nor those who seek to participate in them.  Honestly, I don't.  People are free to seek out whatever kinds of carrying-on makes their trip an enjoyable one and there seems to be something of an agreement that those I previously described can be seen as among the most popular, they're just not my idea of a good time.\n\nNo, when I'm in Vegas I'm there to eat.  I do a little gambling.  A little shopping, maybe.  But the focus of my three-or-four-times-a-year sojourns in Sin City are focused on great food and wine.  Las Vegas has positioned itself as a destination for the gustatorily inclined, amongst which I count myself and my small group of friends.  So there you have it.\n\nBut what to do in-between meals?  What indeed?  It's a puzzle, isn't it?\n\nThank goodness, then, for the Bellagio Gallery of Fine art.  And while not incredibly well curated, it does at least have interesting pieces on display whenever I visit.  They usually let an exhibit run for 4-6 months or so, and though it's never anything TRULY exciting, it does at least offer a welcome oasis of high-culture in a desert of debasement.  \n\nYou'll never see anything as outside the mainstream as a Jason Rhoades installation there.  I don't think any Richard Prince retrospectives are in danger of being hung, but I did see some nice O'Keefes, Marsden Hartleys, and an Ashille Gorky on my last visit.  There have been Picassos, Cezannes, and Monets in the past, and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nThe space is a little cramped, which gets in the way of appreciating pieces at varying distances, and the flow of the space is a little odd, and maybe the paintings are grouped a little tightly sometimes... but I'm willing to forgive these little transgressions as grateful as I am to have something besides an 80-foot high mural of a showgirl's ass to gaze at while I'm waiting for mealtime to roll around.  Not that... well... you get the idea.\n\nAs long as you manage your expectations, the 17 bucks you will drop for admission is pretty good compared to what that same amount will buy you out on the casino floor.  Go on, get some culture!  It's good for ya!  There will be plenty of time for scooters and 'ritas and showgirl-ass later in the day.  Trust me, there always is.","useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":5}

I'm not a huge Warhol enthusiast, but I really enjoy several artists that were inspired by his work.  So we figured we would come and check out the original.  \n\nLet me first say that the Bellagio cannot really control what the Warhol people choose to display.  So I won't hold this against them.  But I will say that the pieces chosen were odd.  None of them said a whole lot about the artist.  And that gets me to the other failing, there wasn't much to look at.  There were three small rooms with relatively bare walls.\n\nAt first I thought the ticket prices were decent, two of us got in for 24 dollars.  However, after getting through the exhibit in just over fifteen minutes, I couldn't help but feel let down.  More than ten dollars for a few minutes of glances, and nothing jumped out as inspiring or monumental.  \n\nThe audio tour included was dull, and rambled on a lot about things that weren't too important.  And there were also an absorbant amount of security in the place, lingering over our shoulders the whole time wondering if we were taking pictures or not.  I get that important art must be protected, but so many guards ruined the immersive experience one is supposed to have while at a gallery.\n\nWith such an alluring figure as Warhol, I went in expecting to be entertained.  I wasn't concerned about the ticket price.  But after leaving feeling more than unfulfilled, I had to wonder if maybe it all should have been a bit cheaper.\n\nAll this said, I'm glad the Bellagio is displaying art.  And I welcome other exhibits, hopefully on the more interesting side.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

When the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. That means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed).

How lucky was I since Claude Monet has been my favorite painter ever since I was first introduced to his work in 2nd grade!!! You bet I was freakin excited! (Especially since I've never been to Europe so I have yet to see his most famous works...so far I have only been able to see only a handful of his original pieces).\n\nThe gallery is open until 8 pm, with last admission at 7:30 pm. We allowed ourselves a good hour to spend in the gallery. The tickets were reasonably priced: $11 for students, $16 for general adults. Though the gallery was small and comprised of about 4 rooms, there were probably at least 20 paintings on display.  We were told they were on loan from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. There is a complimentary audio tour but I personally declined the option, so I cannot give much feedback on that.\n\nI was slightly disappointed that not all of the works were by Monet, though it was still nice to see some variety (other works included those by Boudin, Pissarro, and Corot).  They showcased a lovely selection of both famous and less-known Monet pieces. However, they did not have any water lilies or Japanese bridge, which I would have loved to see.\n\nSome of my favorites from the gallery were:\n\nGrainstack (sunset)\nMeadow with Haystacks near Giverny\nMeadow with Poplars\nAntibes Seen from the Plateau Notre-Dame\nCharing Cross Bridge (overcast day)\nEntrance to the Village of Vetheuil in Winter\n\nThere are a couple of security guards, as one would expect. But I was pleasantly surprised (and most appreciative!!) that they did not reprimand me when I peered fairly closely at each painting (framed behind glass) to view the intricate textures and brushstrokes, which I have unfortunately experienced in the past at another museum.\n\nA superb exhibit -- if you are you a Monet fan, you mustn't miss this!

Regarding the Andy Warhol exhibit itself, it's really not for everyone.  You have to be a fan of Warhol to love this exhibit.  And even if you're a huge fan, you need to keep in mind that only a select pieces of his artwork is displayed here. In other words, your favorite pieces may or may not be on display.  I once dated someone that was a huge fan so you can say I was forced to love some of his work.  \n\nPS: When you exit, don't forget to stop by Jeff Mitchum's Gallery.

In today's world of Instagram filters and Photoshop, people may look at his work and say, \"I can do that!\" or \"that's not art!\" But don't let the simple or mundane of Warhol's style fool you. He spoke about society through his work in a very tongue-in-cheek way.\n\nThe Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art's showing of Warhol Out West, is currently displaying 59 pieces of his work on loan from The Warhol museum in Pittsburgh, the birthplace of Andy Warhol. \n\nFrom the famous soup cans, to screen tests, balloons to ballroom dancing instructions, the exhibit has a little bit of everything from Warhol's work. Also included in the collection are less famous works, such as his Polaroid pictures of celebrities, which have influenced the likes of celebrity photographer Terry Richardson, or Warhol's rendition of American Master Charles Schreyvogel's \"Breaking through the Line.\"\n\nPortraits of Geronimo, Annie Oakley and General Custer, along with others from the \"Cowboys and Indians\" collection, are on display. It is in this collection that Warhol's critique of society shines through. \n\nWhen the docent turned to the small crowd gathered around her, she asked \"So what do you think of Warhol's work?\"  Two people on the tour had competing ideas about it. \"I just love how he could see beauty and form in the everyday piece and elevate it to high art\" and another observer, \"We're standing in a five-star resort, and paid money to look at balloons and soup cans. This was clearly one big joke to him and one big eff you to pretentious people in the art world. He turned his joke into a money-making deal for himself. Good for him.\"\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Warhol's work, this exhibit is the perfect chance for you to pick a side - was Warhol serious about his art, or was he making a buck while simultaneously saying through his work, \"don't hate the artist; hate the art game?\" You decide.\n\nAudio tours are available all day and docent led tours, which are highly suggested, are offered every day at 2 p.m. Tours are free with admission. $16 general admission, $13 for Nevada residents, $11 for students with ID.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":3}

I first attended the Impressionist show at the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art about five years ago, and was duly impressed and surprised by the scholarship and selection of the work.  As a former museum professional, it made sense that Vegas would have the money to pay for the crating, insurance, and exhibition of priceless works of art.  Having worked at a major Modern art museum, it was also a pleasant surprise to use the audio tour to hear the level of scholarship that was available to the casual art viewer.\n\nI have seen every show at the gallery since the first show. My first stop in Vegas is this gallery, now that the Guggenheim branch at the Venetian is closed.  I do, however, miss the voice overs of the likes of Jeremy Irons on the audio tours that the Guggenheim used to feature.  There is nothing like well-written art scholarship read with passionate restraint.\n\n One of my particular favorite shows was on Early Modernism in America, from the vital beginnings of Post World War II art in New York, and featured an array of works that must have been hard to locate and assemble.  The exhibitions here, although limited because of the gallery size, are focused and sophisticated.\n\nI do use either the teacher, or local discount for admission, so it reduces the price.  However, as an art history teacher, I have had to buy museum memberships in order to see large shows at major museums, not to mention the added costs of parking and transportation to reach destination cities.   This small, easily accessible gallery is ideal.\n\nThis gallery also accomplishes the egalitarian task of displaying work to everyone, not just the art lover who takes the time to visit a museum.\nThese shows are well worth the price of admission for an hour or so in the company of cultural artifacts that represent the highest aspirations of mankind.\n\nThe book store also has some unique, scholarly books that feature the work shown in the gallery, so a visit there after the show is always rewarding.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

What a disappointment!! First timers are going to wonder what all the fuss is about . The burgers were lacking flavor, not hot and you had to look for the onions - and as we all know that gives this little (but expensive) burger the flavor and steam needed to make that bun so special. Neither were there. The bun top actually made it a bit dry since there was NO ketchup and cold! As a local, I will buy the frozen ones and not make the trip to the strip for this $1.29 miss .

This place is like a cheap imitation while charging almost double for it.  \n\nFirst issue is the fact they don't add ketchup like they do at all white castles.  I had to tear all of my burgers apart to add ketchup which being sliders was cumbersome.  Even the guy I complained to who is from NJ said \" we don't do that, even though all of the other ones do it\".\n\nSecond issue was the quality.  The burgers weren't fully cooked, since the patties are so thin, this is very hard to screw up.\n\nThird issue was the fries.  They were much thinner and far less quantity than the normal white castles.\n\nFourth issue was the very loud intercom, they yell almost every 15 seconds your order numbers.  This interrupts the dining experience and hurt my ears.\n\nIf you want the real white castle experience I highly suggest you skip this horrible excuse for a white castle and go to an established one.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Other than that, the food isn't exceptionally great.  In fact, it's actually a bit on the expensive side.  A four slider meal with a handful of crinkly fries and a coke goes for about $10 after tax.  Not really cheap.  You actually might still be hungry after that.  I don't hate it but if it was a few bucks cheaper, I think it would be a better value for your buck.","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":2}

After waiting in line for 20 minutes I finally ordered a dozen burgers to go. I don't care for onions so I ordered those burgers without them and the lady repeated that. I waited several more minutes for them to come out--my mistake was not checking them in the restaurant. I drove all the way home only to find out these burgers had been completely caked in onions. After scraping off a massive amount of onions, reheating the burgers and having my meal I decided to call the restaurant to inform them of their mistake. I was surprised when no one answered. I tried a few more times. Nothing. The next day I tried calling and still nothing. So I left a voicemail with my contact information. I waited a few days and received no type of reply back. At this point I gave up. If they can't even reply to a customer then they don't deserve my business. White Castle can be good but this location has a big ego being the only one in Vegas. If you do encounter a problem you will have to personally go in and inquire about it. No one cares enough to call back. Just a forewarning.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I always heard of the business--known for their sliders--and was always interested in tasting one of their products. I guess I just assumed that WC was like the McDonald's of the East Coast, and I wanted to see what it was about those sliders that made them so great (especially after seeing the White Castle excerpt from \"Harold and Kumar\").\n \nThere were pre-organized queues and a HUGE WC tent, so I'm sure the vendor expected mile-long lines. However, when we went on the first night the foodie fair was open, there was NO line; only a few people were in front of us so we didn't have to wait long to order and get our grub.\n \nFinal verdict: After all that hype, I think I was slightly underwhelmed by those sliders. Maybe it's just because I was different from what I was expecting. Was I glad I tried them? Yes, definitely. Would I crave them late at night? Not so much ... if I were craving fast food late at night, I would probably go for Five Guys fries (soooo addictive) or anything from Del Taco or Chick-Fil-A.\n \nBut here's what my friend and I got, as well as what I would try next time if I ever visited a WC again:\n \n\"Cheese Sliders\": These sliders vary slightly from the \"Original\" because they include a slide of American cheese. I need cheese in my burgers ... since I take out the tomatoes and pickles, I can't really just have a slider with the burger alone. My friend and I got 2 for $3 (at least these buggers were cheap), and we saw them being mass produced--in that the thin patties were on the grill in multiples and the workers were putting everything together in true assembly-line fashion. The bun was soft and tasted fresh, which was a plus, but the patty--is that what you even call it?--was super thin ... so thin that I could hardly even taste it. It reminded me of a super thin slice of Spam. I liked the fact that the slider was really light--didn't feel heavy and bloated after eating it--but it definitely needed that cheese. I guess I was expecting the slider to be addicting\/have some kind of addictive taste since it got so much hype, but that factor was lacking for me. I'm glad for the experience, but I would probably order something different next time. (Seriously, I don't know how people order packs and packs of these).\n \n\"Bacon & Cheddar Grilled Chicken\": I would actually be interested in trying this slider because it has more elements that I like. This medley features savory grilled chicken with a zesty cheddar-cheese sauce and smoky-bacon crumbles. I do like cheese and bacon, so maybe this slider will be slightly more tasty that the \"Cheese Slider\" that I had.\n \n\"Western BBQ Grilled Chicken\": I love BBQ flavors so this slider sounds like it's right up my alley. It features a savory, grilled chicken slider topped with smoky BBQ sauce and crispy onion rings. I do like BBQ-inspired sandwiches, so I'm down to try this slider one day.\n \n\"Fish Sliders\": I've had fish sliders before that I really liked, so I'm willing to give the WC version a go. It features two fish sliders made with Alaska Pollock and topped with American cheese. You can even upgrade to a combo and add small fries and a soft drink. I'm not the hugest fan of soft drinks, but I would want to add fries to my order ... this is sort of like fish 'n chips, after all, but in slider form.\n \n\"Loaded Fries\": I'm a huge fan of loaded fries, and since the WC version features fries topped with creamy ranch dressing and hickory-smoked bacon crumbles, I'd definitely want to order them some day.\n \n\"Brownie on a Stick\": This dessert sounds really cute and seems to be a great mini indulgence. This treat on a stick features a chocolate brownie dipped in a rich, fudge coating. Brownies are one of my favorite snacks, and everything just tastes better when it's presented in a fun form ... so if I'm craving something sweet after my WC meal, I would go for this.\n \n\"Cheesecake on a Stick\": Like its brownie counterpart, this cheesecake piece is bound to be the best little indulgence after a fast food meal. It's made with light and creamy cheesecake and dipped in a rich, fudge coating. I'm so down to try this chocolate covered cheesecake (both of these dipped dessert options were not available at the truck, so maybe I have to visit an actual WC restaurant to get it ...)\n \n\"Bacon, Egg & Cheese Slider\": This breakfast slider sounds like one of the best ones on the WC menu. It includes freshly cracked, loosely scrambled eggs topped with American cheese and crisp, hickory-smoked bacon on a steamed signature bun. I'm a huge fan of breakfast sandwiches, so I would be willing to try this breakfast slider if I came to WC when the breakfast menu's being featured.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

They cook on these little square griddle inserts in the counters and there are multiple little stations. \nNot sure where their beef comes from, but it does look a bit unappetizing when they are laying it out in the onions, at first I thought they were putting on some sort of red square rubber spacers with holes in them so they can steam the buns with the onion aroma, but nope, those square red Lego looking things are actually the patties. \nI was aware that they only offer little sliders, but I was not aware that the little sliders cost the same as a full sized burger elsewhere (1 single plain slider with nothing on it costs $1.35), they have to have huge margins here as you get basically a meatball on a roll for the price of a Big Mac. (Not that I condone eating Big Macs)\nWe ordered the meal that came with 4 sliders (with cheese) and some fries, and also ordered 2 of their chicken ring sliders. The chicken ones were actually pretty tasty, tasted very similar to burger kings chicken sandwiches, the sort of over processed ground chicken variety. The sliders were fairly tasty and I did like the idea of eating the little thing, and though they are very basic they taste pretty good, as everything cooks in and with their caramelized onions. I did, however, need to dip the burger in ketchup to get a more deep flavor. I felt like they tasted sort of like a basic McDonald's Cheeseburger and an In-n-out \"Animal Style\" cheeseburger had a baby (so somewhere I between the quality of the 2 though much more on the McDonald's side).\nThe Fries were also pretty good, though nothing to write home about. They are the wavy variety and not over salted. \nBecause the things were so small, I had the go back and order more food! This time I got 2 more chicken ring sliders and went for 2 double cheese sliders this time, which by the way are over $3 a piece! That's like the price of the \"six dollar burger\" at Carl's Jr, or the more expensive burgers at about every fast food chain, but again even the double burger is less substantial than a single \"$.99 cent menu\" burger elsewhere. \nAll in all we ended up spending over $30!!! Just to get full here, that is a ton for a fast food place!\nI really don't think I'll be back to a White Castle anytime soon, it's possible the craving could hit me when I see one because it is a unique taste, but even then, I'll likely just grab one slider to go and eat it on the way to wherever else I'm going to eat.","useful":0,"funny":2,"cool":0}

When my sister-in-law saw that there was a White Castle in Las Vegas, one of her vacation stops here had to be White Castle--something that she fondly remembers from her youth.  I am still firmly in the I don't get it column.\n\nThere were three of us and we ordered a 10 pack bag with three bottles of water.  The sliders come out to be just over a dollar each but they were missing something.  Even the devoted sister-in-law thought they were missing at the very least some salt (and she doesn't use salt very much).  \n\nI was underwhelmed by the sliders.  The onion taste was about the best thing and it's really stretching it calling that little thin piece of beef a slider.  The thing is mostly bread.\n\nBeing in the Casino Royale doesn't make it an easily accessible place unless you're a tourist walking the Strip and decide to drop in.  We walked from the Venetian.\n\nAgain, I just don't get the cult following.

The place was busy, but that was no surprise with the aforementioned popularity still booming. The line was relatively long but moved at a decent rate. They do well to get you through and on your way. We waited about 15-20 minutes in line. The menu is simpler than most fast food type joints with limited offerings. Think somewhere between In n Out and Chil Fil A. I appreciate this; makes it easier for someone like me who wants to get right to the \"bread and butter\" if you will and skip over their second rate items. The sliders were much smaller than we expected; again we've never had even the frozen grocer variety so expectations were only speculative. It reminded me of a plain McDonalds burger with the small chopped onions being one of the only things on the burgers other than the meat. The fries were nothing special. Not great but also without any major flaw. Straightforward French fries.

I truly believe I had the  exact same feeling that Harold and Kumar had when they finally arrive at the place where they have been dying to get to all because they have been yearning for those little magical sliders in the pretty little white box.\n\nAs I stepped through the double glass door from the Las Vegas strip and entered this gold mine I was filled with happiness. Who would have ever thought that we would be so lucky to have a White Castle here, but I guess dreams do come true.\n\nThe line was not bad and space was pretty small and yes they only have 2 cash register but there was an army of workers in the back cranking out them sliders and the food came out fast. As I am placing my order I am still in disbelief that I didn't have to travel to the east coast to experience this must try burger joint. Any how that was just it. I am giving them a 4 stars because although everything was great the burger itself the one thing that this place is all so famous for was good but I wish was better by being hot and fresh. \n\nI totally understand that in order to meet demands and keep customers happy by getting their food quick they must constantly pump out burgers and let them sit there, and that's where it suffers I think. I burgers itself was a little cold. But never the less I was extremely content. I ordered almost every item on the menu because even though I wish it was a hope skip and a jump, it is not easy for us locals to just drive up and pick us up a bag full of burgers...no you must be strategic about it and actually plan your day to enjoy this place and it's food. \n\nAll in all everything was good and I defiantly will be back again and again. I'm crossing my fingers they will open up other locations where we can just pull up to a drive thru and satisfy our cravings a little easier. I think I have been building up the anticipation about White Castles since the movie Harold and Kumar and never thought I would ever get to taste them or get to one without actually leaving Vegas but now I can.

We stopped by on Saturday afternoon around 5:30, it took 45 minutes to wait and order, then another 10 to receive our meal which wasn't too bad.\n\nWe were able to find a little spot to sit in really quick, the table was clean but the space was tiny. The employees that I dealt with were friendly. \n\nI can say that I am glad we took the safe route and ordered very little food, better safe than sorry. I got combo #2 which comes with 4 cheese sliders, an order of fries and a drink for $8.99, I also ordered 6 additional cheese sliders, an order of onion chips, and a fudge dipped cheesecake on a stick (additional burgers were for the kids at home). I ordered all of the cheese sliders without onions. When our number was called my husband picked up the order and brought it back to the table. I opened the bag up and noticed no cheese and onions on the first slider, so it took out one after another and noticed they all had no cheese but they did all have onions, on top of that, I didn't receive my cheesecake. I put the sliders back in the bag and took them back, they threw the sliders away and I waited another 10 minutes to receive the \"correct\" order. First 4 sliders were fine, cheese and no onions, other 6, cheese with onions. WTF! My receipt clearly stated cheese and no onions for all 10 sliders! At that point I was annoyed so I didn't take them back to the front counter, but seriously, you must really not know what you're doing if you get my order wrong twice. To top it off the burgers were semi-warm, they should be glad I didn't become very disgruntled.\n\nI honestly wasn't impressed with the tiny burgers, I took a bite and to my surprise, it tasted just like a McDonald's $1 cheeseburger. The slider consisted of a bun, thin patty, and sliced pickles. The fries weren't anything special either, they tasted just like the crinkle cut fries that you buy at the grocery store and fry up yourself. Onion chips were okay, they were very crisp and had a semi sweet taste to them. The best part of the meal was my orange fanta beverage and the fudge dipped cheesecake on a stick. We spent $25 on our meal and thought it was a complete waste. Meal #2 comes with enough food to fill up a hungry toddler, not an adult. The cost is not justifiable to me, too little food for the price, $1.50 for a tiny cheese slider, no thanks. \n\nI came, I tasted, too over-hyped.","useful":9,"funny":6,"cool":6}

I walked in with pretty low expectations and they didn't even meet that. But you're likely going to check out White Castle anyway whether it's out of morbid curiosity like I did, or because of nostalgia. \n\nI stopped by on opening day because I was walking distance away and had a friend already in line. The line moved relatively quickly, but White Castle way underestimated the wait time. It's nice that they handed out free sliders as a sorry, but ironically that well intended gesture made me consider getting out of line after sampling their sliders. But I promised to bring WC back for other people, so stayed in line.\n\nGreat service for a fast food place especially on opening day. Everybody was helpful nice, and smiley despite all the chaos - I read they were churning out around 4,000 sliders an hour, which is insane. \n\nI've never been to another WC before, but heard that they're normally priced around 80cents each vs the cheapest you'll get it here is $1.09 with the 100 pack. They can say the higher prices are due to higher rent on the strip, but that's bs - they would've made up for that with the ridiculously high volume this location will do, so they're just plain greedy. But what can you do - it's the only WC west of... think it was Missouri? \n\nAnyway, back to their crappy burgers. Yes I know that sliders are small, but paying over $1 for something that's 1\/18th of a pound of weird gray \"beef\" is just silly. For comparison, a McDonalds hamburger (also crappy) is 1\/10th of a pound and at least looks more like real beef than this does. The bun was ok and I like grilled onions, but I did not enjoy tasting them for the rest of my day.  \n\nI guess it's WC's thing that they never dress the sliders for you - want some ketchup and mustard? Too bad, you get grilled onions and pickles - anything else you have to add to it yourself. Not a huge deal, except that you need to know to ask for it, then wait for the guy to get packets from the back because they don't have them out to just grab. And he only gave me 1 packet each of ketchup, mustard and mayo for 10 sliders, so thanks for that because ketchup and mustard were the only things that gave the burger any taste.  \n\nAlso ordered a chocolate shake because the lady said they're amazing since they're made from frozen custard not ice cream or soft serve. It was a decent but overpriced shake, which was so thick that I couldn't drink it through a straw. I have no idea if that's how they always are, but a spoon would've been nice. \n\nI would normally say well I didn't like it, however you should probably try it out for yourself. In this case I have to say eff it - skip the lines and the clusterf*ck we call the strip and just pick up the frozen ones from the market. They sadly do taste about the same and I think are cheaper.","useful":6,"funny":5,"cool":6}

On an average day how many sliders does this place serve? Pretty curios about that. Anyways anybody that grew up back east should know White Castle. This is the first location in the west so of course it had to go on Las Vegas Blvd. Not sure what some people were expecting or built up in their minds about this place. It's exactly the same it's always been just higher prices (not extreme though) because of the location. As a Vegas local and someone that grew up with eating here I can say it's good but not deserving of more than 3 stars. \n\nPROS\nSame White Castle you have always had. If you enjoyed them in the past you will enjoy them here\nThey serve beer which is pretty cool \nDining area seems to be well kept and clear of trash \n\nCONS\nLocation..  Good for the company I'm sure but locals absolutely hate coming to the strip. I understand why the first one had to go here but wish now there was an easier one outside of the strip to get to \nSize.. As I said well kept and clean but not nearly big enough for the amount of foot traffic that comes through. \nSome employees... Look I work with drunk asshole tourists everyday too so I understand what they go through but there are some (not all) here that have just  nasty attitudes. Granted it's a few bad apples but they leave an impression. A few times the fries were old\/cold and asked politely for new ones and have been met with sighs and eye rolls.

I've never been to one of their locations before but I figured it would be a cool experience, especially seeing it practically get famous from Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (I can't believe that movie is 11 years old now!)\n\nLocated on the Casino Royale side of the Strip, White Castle offers cheap sliders at any time of the day. I honestly think it's better than most fast food chains, but it tasted the same as the microwaveable ones you can buy at the grocery store.\n\nThe breakfast slider was pretty good, though. It really isn't anything special because it's just a sausage patty with an egg, but it does the trick if you want something simple and filling for breakfast.\n\nIt's not a gourmet burger joint, but it's definitely nice to have one of these on the Strip. The cheap prices and better quality food than other fast food chains are what makes White Castle a winner in my book! It might be a little too over-hyped, but it's still a place to visit just to say you've been to one.","useful":11,"funny":8,"cool":9}

Everyone is curious about White Castle and what they have to offer. All we had before were the microwaveable burgers, and that certainly cannot match up to a restaurant's quality of burgers, right? \n\nWell... White Castle is certainly good, but maybe not as good as we hoped. I would say it is slightly better in the store than it is from the frozen burgers. One view I have is that the bread and meat is not cooked long enough. If they were cooked an extra thirty seconds to a minute, it would taste much better in my opinion. The texture of the burgers are very similar to the microwaveable version, that is one thing that makes me not think it's that great. Their fries were pretty good, as well as their chicken rings, and that's what brings it up a little for me. The location isn't the greatest, but it isn't too far away from things where you have to go so far out of your way for it. It is a bit pricy in my opinion for the amount of food that you get, but what do you expect, it's the only White Castle on the west coast.

Original or Cheese Sliders. They serve beer on tap! How awesome is that?!

I only like onions if they're cooked or caramelized or depending on my mood. I know I'm weird. Lol\n\nI had low expectations going into this place despite reading other reviews. The cheese sliders wasn't too bad. I would eat it again. The cheese was so gooey and blended well with the onions and meat party. The original one was just too plain. The cheese definitely makes it taste 10x better. I don't recommend the original ones at all.

Even before I saw Harold & Kumar, I enjoyed their frozen sliders growing up.  Eating the real deal after all this time, even after a great German lunch, was heaven.

I have been wanting to try it ever since Harold and Kumar.  I already knew going in that I was probably not going to be blown away by White castle.  I had tried the microwavable ones and they were okay.  It is fast food and sliders, so I was not expecting gourmet or even In N Out status.  I was just excited to try it just for the sake of saying I had it before.  \n\nIt is open 24 hours and located inside the Casino Royale.  We were staying at the Venetian which was just a short walk away.  The line was pretty long when we got there but it moved pretty quickly.  Their menu mostly concentrates on their sliders and they have a few slider combinations that you can get.  We decided on 10 sliders with cheese and a side of onion slices.  Each slider comes in a square box and has chopped onions and a pickle inside.  We got our order pretty quickly and headed back to the Venetian to enjoy our food.  The people working there are really nice and good natured.  They were having fun at their jobs and our cashier had a good personality.  \n\nI read a lot of people complaining about the size and relative price of the burgers.  It is a slider, that is what they are known for and it is fast food AND it is Vegas.  Everything in Vegas is like a dollar or so more in pricing when compared to another city where tourism is not so heavily relied upon.  Seriously though, lower your expectations a bit beforehand and you should be good. \n\nDespite thier small size, those things pack quite a punch because of the buns.  I got full after eating about 4 of them.  The first one I ate, I thought was really good.  The onions, cheddar cheese, soft bun and thin patty came together perfectly.  I did not even mind the pickle in there and I usually hate pickles.  I thoroughly enjoyed my first one.  By the third and fourth one, I was enjoying then less and less.  If you have had the microwavable ones, then you have pretty much tasted what they taste like.  They taste exactly like the microwavable boxed ones except just a tiny bit better.  The onion chips were really good.  I would definately recommend that if you like onions.  The breading is crunchy and thick.  We ended up having two sliders left over and I ate one at like 5 am when we got back from the club.  Still pretty good, but the bun got really hard.  \n\nI enjoyed my sliders but then again I came in with low expectations.  If you are not from the midwest or east coast and you just happen to be in Vegas, I would definately give it a shot.  It is open 24 hours anyways.  I do not think I would crave them but I would get it again if it were convenient.","useful":7,"funny":5,"cool":3}

Since this Vegas trip was primarily focused on burgers I wanted to experience as many places as possible. Ever since the movie Harold & Kumar go to White Castle popularized the existence of this burger chain to a wider audience, it has always been on the back of my mind to try it. Unfortunately since they are only located in the Midwestern United States, I had to settle on the frozen ones that they sell and love it or hate it, I find them quite tasty! \n\nLas Vegas is known for housing popular \"guilty pleasure\" restaurants that can't be found outside of their respective regions or cities, making them must-visit destinations for tourists. Casinos have opened such iconic locations as Pink's Hot Dogs from Los Angeles in the Planet Hollywood Casino, and New York City's Shake Shack recently found a home inside the New York, New York Casino.\n\nThis White Castle is located across the street from the Mirage. You can easily walk to this location by parking either at the Ceaser's Palace self parking or at any other of the casinos close by and walk to it. The location is small but there is plenty of seating available inside. Since I've had the frozen ones plenty of times before, I wanted to order the exact ones which were the cheeseburger sliders. The lowest combo you can get is 4 sliders with fries and a drink which is what I decided to get (having still been fairly full from the buffet from earlier). \n\nOnce you place your order, you get a number to wait; thankfully orders are pushed out quick since they are made en masse. The sliders are all packaged individually; I can only imagine how many they go through a day. Taking my first bite, it instantly reminded me of the frozen ones. I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. The only difference was that there are pickles in the sliders that are not in the frozen ones. It does add more flavor to it but not much else. These sliders go quick, I can usually finish one in two bites or one if I really want to. The fries are crinkle cut, my personal favorite, they aren't as good as Del Taco's or Shake Shack's fries but it gets the job done. \n\nI would suggest coming here if you have NEVER eaten the frozen ones before. Then you can brag to all your friends who live out in the west or east coast saying that you've actually been to an actually White Castle. This place is worth coming for a late night snack, drunk food or a quick meal. Otherwise, if you have had the frozen ones before then you are really not missing out on anything other than the pickle. \n\nI am a fan of White Castle sliders but I'll settle for the frozen ones just fine. \n\nCC out!","useful":11,"funny":10,"cool":10}

If you look at the special \"dollar menu\" items at rival fast food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, Wendy's etc. and take a step back and analyze how much food you get in a White Castle Burger vs a full sized burger, it doesn't add up 'tho.  It takes at least 4 White Castle Burgers to equal a standard burger (not even a Whopper or a Big Mac, Quarter Pounder, Jumbo Jack or Happy Star).\n\nSo, to that degree, I think the mini-burgers are worth at most $0.50 each and ideally, not to be thrifty sounding, but in analyzing pound for pound and bang for the buck comparisons to their peers, maybe 3 for $1 or 4 for $1, so about $0.25 each (they did debut after all for $0.05, a nickle each, albeit back in the 1920's nearly a century ago.\n\nBeyond the pricing, the food was unique, it has a soft steamed bun with a pickle and chopped cooked onions with a very thin and sort of slimy (not in a bad way) square (a la Wendy's) beef patty which is reminiscent of those Banquet\/Swanson's frozen dinner \"Salisbury steak\" or sliced meatloaf.\n\nIt's quite tasty and I like 'em where others may feel they're stoner late night snacks, I can see eating 'em and easily going through 4 and possibly eating 10 and maybe even being up to the challenge of over indulging to potentially eat 20... and those statements are both a testament to the fact they do taste good, but they're also not so filling and very small in size.\n\nThe french fries are really weak 'tho, previously frozen crinkle cut, very thin, small portions.  I'd roll the money to be spent on fries towards other food purchases.  Del Taco uses similar styled fries, but they're much better in pricing, portions and execution (fried nice and fluffy inside and crispy outside).\n\nI rate this * * * three stars, \"A OKAY\" which means I'd recommend it and come back again, but it's not necessarily so unique that I'd crave it and put it on my \"must go to\" list whenever in the area, which is in part my criteria for my rankings of places that earn four or five stars.\n\nThis location is on the Vegas Strip in a very safe area, easy to park if you park in a hotel casino I'm sure, congested to get to by car via the Las Vegas main strip, but convenient if you're staying in a local hotel.","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":4}

Even though I never watched the Harold and Kumar movie before, I have heard about the sliders from White Castle and I couldn't wait to try one. Luckily, this fast food restaurant was open 24\/7 so after a night of clubbing, my friend and I headed over to this place for a quick meal. There was definitely no lines on a Tuesday morning around 4am, and I quickly ordered one original slider ($1.29) and one chicken ring slider ($1.99) to try. The cashier proudly told me he had 15 chicken rings for lunch when I seemed hesitant in trying the chicken ring slider. I was definitely not hungry enough for 15 chicken sliders, but you do you boo. However, props to the cashier working on this 4am shift! \n\nWhen I received my sliders, I was quite surprised at how tiny these sliders looked. They were about the size of my palms and I'm pretty sure I can eat the slider in one bite if I tried hard enough. Taste wise- they were both okay. They were not mind-blowing and I don't see myself craving these sliders in the future. They actually tasted a bit plain to me, since there was no special sauce included in the beef or chicken slider. I guess this a good place to grab a quick bite if you are on a budget since the prices were more reasonable than other restaurants on the strip.

I guess that is the one perk about living in a city that is just one big tourist destination.\n\nWhite Castle made its debut a few months ago in Casino Royale, a hotel that is smashed between the Venetian and Harrah's. White Castle is really easy to find since their have their own entrance from the street. I have read the reviews about the long lines, so I waited out the hype and my first visit was last week. I was there around 4pm on a Sunday and the line was not too bad-- I would say tops, 15 minutes. \n\nWe ordered four cheese sliders, a double slider, loaded fries, regular fries, cheese sticks, and drinks. The person took our order asked where we were visiting from and when replied that we lived here she offered us a 10% local discount. Sweet! You wait for your number to be called at the end of the counter. The food came out in about 5 minutes. \n\nCheese Sliders-- They are pretty tiny, seeing how the meat in the burger is about the thickness of about 10 post it notes stacked on top of each other. But hey, they were still pretty tasty. I like the squishy buns. Ha, that sounds really weird.\n\nFries-- Crinkle fries are better than any other fries in the whole entire world. So, I like!\n\nLoaded Fries-- Meh, could skip on these. The bacon and cheese toppings were not that special.\n\nCheese Sticks-- I think these things could be good if there was better marinara sauce. The sauce comes in one of those sauce tubs that do not require refrigeration. It has a weird after taste. \n\nAfter reading all of the mixed reviews, I have to say that my visit was better than expected. A lot of people are saying that it is not like how it is on the east coast, but that's how it usually goes. The original is always better. Don't even get me started on Shake Shack LV. All of our mini sliders & fries came out to be around $20-- but that was expected, since this is the strip. The next time I want to try the cheesecake on a stick or the chicken sliders. I think I saw a sign that said that they also have a breakfast menu.\n\nOh yeah, White Castle is open 24\/7 to satisfy your after party munchies.","useful":12,"funny":5,"cool":9}

There's an army deep of prep workers and cooks in the back and periodically over a block long line of White Castle fans, with a team of security directing traffic and you only have TWO registers? Yeah, its awkward.\n\nO T H E R W I S E...\n\nWoohoo! White Castle is officially in Las Vegas! I can't speak on behalf of anyone else, but White Castle holds a special place in my tummy. I was born in Minnesota and still have family living there, so whenever I would visit, my uncle would welcome me to town with a crave case. What says love more than a giant box, shiny with grease, filled with sliders?\n\nOf course, this is nowhere near the top ranked best fast food burger, but it wins in the nostalgia points! Mini sliders with grilled onions - you can't go wrong there -  portable, cute, easy to eat, and especially reminds me of my childhood. Their burgers taste like how I remember it, so they don't do a bad job at this Vegas location but consistency is questionable. On our second visit my sliders were all too soggy for my liking - which is not good, not good at all.\n\nI actually prefer the original sliders over the cheese slider since the cheese overwhelms the flavor of the grilled onions too much and I love love LOVE the flavor of the grilled onions. Sometimes I would try to ask them for extra grilled onions and most of the time I am unsuccessful, but it's worth a try. \n\nWe also dabbled in their cheese fries with ranch and bacon and the crew thought it was pretty tasty, but I think their crinkle cut fries need major work and typically taste stale. I really like their ranch sauce so I dip my sliders in it from time to time. Also pass on their onion chips, the batter is dense and not that great. Their shakes are simple, vanilla or chocolate - nothing crazy, but its not bad either. I don't think they offer a strawberry shake at this location since I would of been all over that. Oh yeah and they have brownies and cheesecake on a stick - just thought I'd let you know. \n\nI can typically eat 5 sliders on a good day and it is filling! For a normal person I think that 3-4 sliders is just right. For the overzealous types they also offer crave cases  and crates that range anywhere from 30-50-100! Dang. Don't come in here expecting an amazing burger - just great memories - KEEP YOUR EXPECTATIONS IN CHECK and I think you will be in a good place.\n\nRIP stomach.","useful":8,"funny":8,"cool":8}

So whenever I went on a trip to the East Coast, I tried to make White Castle a must visit place. Unfortunately, it always eluded me, thus making the allure of White Castle that much greater. Even when it made its appearance at the food truck festivals, I opted not to wait in the 3 hour line. so when I heard they opened up a location on the strip, I figured I'd try it once and for all. And no, the Wal-Mart ones don't count. I also understand ones expectations usually does not meet their perception when yearning for so long. Plus I heard it's overrated. So when I tried it, I wasn't surprised it wouldn't live up to the hype. But what I didn't expect was for the frozen Wal-Mart ones to be better. That's right, I said it. I like my microwave sliders better. Maybe they rushed to get all orders out quickly, which is why my order felt on the cool side. i have to say though, I went on a Wednesday night and got my order quickly. So that's a plus right? So to end my review, I'll say it was ok. Worth the hype? Nah. Will I go back? Probably not. Vegas is surrounded by burger joints in the same price range.

Not only were the prices higher here, the quality was definitely off. Where they took their time in Chicago putting these sliders together, things were rushed out of the kitchen at this location. These sliders were made with hate and you can taste it. The cheese unmelted, the burgers smashed into its containers, and the flavors sorely lacking.

I learned to appreciate White Castle from the locals. I'm going with 5 Stars due to years of memories from that extended experience. This was before things like WC fish burgers and the newest veggie option. I don't understand all the 3 Star reviews and won't even try to. All I can do is state my own opinion. \n\nVenue: Very small shop, by Las Vegas standards,  that is right off the strip and is right next to\/inside of  a casino. Most easily reached by walking a distance once you find a place to park. There is no convenient parking to speak of. So I recommend combining a trip to WC with something else. Small eating area that was full because the shop was so busy.\n\nFood: The traditional White Castle menu is very simple. Onion Chips, Regular White Castle Burgers, and White Castle Cheese Burgers. But, I don't eat meat burgers anymore. So I was very interested in trying the fish burgers and veggie burgers. These are non-traditional items. I'm sure some are shocked and appalled with the concept. I was motivated to give these a try as I may not get to the midwest in the near future.\n\nVeggie Burger: Good but a great effort at providing meatless. i appreciate the effort. They provide a choice of sauces with these as they are needed. The fish burgers were a similar strong effort. Well appreciated by those on dietary restrictions. \n\nYes,  I was a bit underwhelmed by the veggie burgers but the chance to indulge myself in old memories was priceless.

I was stoked when I heard they were opening a WC in Vegas because that means I no longer have to seek them out when traveling back to the Midwest. I knew the crowds would be bad so I waited a couple weeks before checking it out. But little did I know there would still be crowds and long lines! If you come to this location, expect to wait in 2 separate lines: 1 outside to get into the store and another to order once you get inside. The security guards were a little rude during this whole process, which may turn me off from this location for a while, at least until the lines die down a little.\n\nThis location is also much more expensive than other WC locations I've been to...probably because it's located on the Las Vegas Strip versus some southside hood. The food is on par with any other WC's and is something people either love or hate. You'll never meet someone that just thinks White Castle is alright. They will either love it or hate it and this one is no exception. \n\nMy favorites here are the cheeseburger sliders and chicken rings. Their fries suck so I would stay away from those. I thought maybe this location would be different because it would be fresher due to higher turnover from the crowds but nope...still sucks!

The meat kind of looks like spam (not that I have anything against spam). I have had the frozen ones before and those looked better.\nAs for the taste, it wasn't bad. Typical fast-food burger taste, but the little chopped grilled onions add a lot of flavor.

They have the faintest philly cheesesteak aspect to them that I find irresistible.  And unlike a cheesesteak, which has sliced rib eye steak, a White Castle slider can't be nearly as expensive to replicate that flavor.  I'd say they're on to something, but then again they've been doing this for a while.  After all, some movie director even made a movie with the White Castle name on it which forever immortalized it in the bong-resin charred brains of stoners everywhere.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, I only seem to dip into a White Castle every decade or so, but I was pleased to see that they have all kinds of different sliders these days: chicken sliders, jalapeno sliders, fish sliders, etc.    Maybe next time I'll get a double cheese slider and a bacon & cheddar grilled chicken slider.

I have experienced better. Whether it is the frozen ones at Smiths in the frozen food section or sliders from other restaurants, the actual sliders I had here at this location was mediocre at best if I was I really hungry.\n\nIm trying to understand how east coast  peeps grew up on this garbage. This is definitely one of those spots that are severely hyped up because of the fact that this is the only White Castle closest to the west coast. The funny thing is that the first day they opened, they ran out of food! What a fail on their part. You're open 24 hours. You know you're gonna have patrons lined up for miles but yet you just happen to run out of product. \n\nI knew eventually I had to try it just to see what the hype was. I have only tried the frozen ones so far. So a couple of my friends are here from out of town. Of course they want to try it. So off we went.\n\nLocated just inside the Casino Royale just right off the strip, you line up starting outside if it is really busy. One thing is for sure, I dont think this casino has never seen so many people in their establishment. Since it is a part of the casino, you will be exposed to the smoke factor. You cant smoke where you can sit down and eat your burger but yet you will be inhaling enough of it coming from the casino itself. They have security posted outside where the line begins and one right at the door where you enter.\n\nSo far I have gone 4 paragraphs without any mention of what we ordered. That just shows you how really bad the food is. While my wife went and stayed in line to order food, I scoped out a table. She came back with two craver packs for our group along with loaded fries and 4 drinks. The total came out to 51 bucks and some change. \n\nI was somewhat hungry so I ate 2 regular sliders with cheese. In the other craver pack I also ate 2 regular sliders with pepper jack cheese. Now I LOVE onions but the ones they put in these sliders taste like reconstituted onions. You know, the dry kind that has to be mixed with water to bring it back to life. Then they grill it. The smell of it now that I think about it almost makes me want to vomit. The patty itself does not look like a real beef patty. Referring to my pic, it looks more like prop comparable to those fake plastic fruits you will see in some people's homes. The only thing that may have peaked my interest was the pepper jack cheese. Had a little kick to it. As for the loaded fries, I was no longer in the mood to eat after surprisingly eating 4 sliders.\n\nService was actually decent, otherwise this would be a 1 star review. From standing outside to making it in to order, all took a total of about 25 minutes with 10 waiting for our finished product after ordering. They have one security guard outside to watch the line while another one is at the door entrance to make sure nobody cuts. This was surprisingly organized. Too bad that's it. Oh and that they are open 24 hours would be the other thing.\n\nIn closing, if you have never been here, by all means, try it out so you can make up your own mind if its worthy of a trip to the Casino Royale. I mean, you don't really hear too many people talk about going to the strip just to go to a not too well known casino. \n\nYelp 2015 review #3 \"Harold and Kumar was not missing anything\"\n502 overall","useful":11,"funny":11,"cool":8}

Then, after Harold and Kumar made their movie, I truly hoped that one day I would travel to a place in the mid west or eastern parts that had a White Castle Burger joint, or even better, I wished that White Castle would open a store here in Southern California. Sadly, no luck either way. Then voila! I saw them in the frozen section of my local super market. I bought a pack, took them home and immediately nuked a few in the microwave. Not bad I thought to myself. They had a unique flavor with kind of an onion tang. Nevertheless, these were frozen burgers. I knew the freshly made ones had to be better, so I withheld final judgement, and continued to hope for a real experience at a White Castle location.\n\nFast forward several years and I'm walking the strip in Las Vegas and the White Castle sign hit my like a ton of bricks! There it  was! Boom! A real deal White Castle burger joint right here in Las Vegas, and right in front of me! I dragged the wife into the place and immediately placed an order for sliders, fries and a drink. So let me get this out of the way first, I don't like krinkle fries. And, the White Castle krinkle fries were no different than any other krinkle fries I've tried. So what did I think of the sliders? They were really tasty and much better than the frozen ones, as I expected them to be. These are truly unique sliders. They are steamed with the onion on the patties. I think that's part of what makes them distinctive.\n\nNow, if I'm only judging the slider, in the context of the fast food world of large or popular burger chains, I give it 5 stars considering the under $2 price. I don't smoke weed, but if I did, I could see myself eating a bag of these little morsels after smoking a bowl, just like Harold and Kumar did in the movie. \n\nThe slider is the only thing that stood out. Again, I didn't care for the fries, and everything else was just okay. Service was decent, drink fountain was nothing special. Over all, 4 stars for White Castle, mostly because of their famous sliders.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":2}

The burgers are nearly as good as those in the Midwest.\n\nSo, the GOOD:\n\n- Burgers are nearly as good as the Midwest\n- They give you as many ketchup packets as you want (you probably need to ask if you want any at all)\n- The place seemed clean enough during a busy night around 1 in the morning\n- The wait wasn't bad, for the ordering line or for the pickup line\n\nThe BAD:\n\n- The main thing is the price. It shouldn't be more than a dollar per burger, and obviously buying more burgers should give you some sort of deal. But it's (as of April 2016) $35.99 for a crave case (30 plain sliders), which is almost the exact same price as 30 individual sliders. Likewise, it costs 30 cents to add cheese to a slider. If you add cheese to all 30 sliders, you might expect some deal. Nope. 30 cents times 30 slices of cheese is 9 dollars, which is the exact amount you'll have to add to your price if you want 30 sliders with cheese instead of regular sliders. That means you're paying $44.99 for 30 tiny sliders...and that's before taxes.\n\nLook, I know it's the Vegas strip, so I don't really mind the price that much. Everything's more expensive, and the constant stream of customers proves they're asking a fair market price. Still, I'm taking away a star because that's just way too much money for those tiny burgers. It costs the same amount for 30 tiny sliders as for like 30 full size McDoubles.\n\n- The burgers aren't quite as good as in the Midwest. They're still good -- they'll satisfy if you're a White Castle fan like myself -- but they're just slightly lacking. I think the problem is that they use this large island grill where something like 4 people work at once, and that open setup results in the steam escaping. For those who don't know, part of the magic of White Castle is that the burgers are cooked by steaming them over a bed of onions. So that onion flavor permeates the entire burger and bun. But with the Vegas location setup, I think the steam doesn't do it's job. Which also results in less moist buns.\n\nBut don't let this sway you from going here. Still very good.\n\n- The staff wasn't all that friendly. Not that they were rude. When I asked for ketchup, the guy gave me plenty of ketchup, but didn't even look at me as he was serving me. The people on the grill looked a bit miserable. That's understandable, given they probably spend their day making millions of sliders non-stop because this is a hugely busy location. The girl taking orders was neither friendly nor unfriendly.\n\n- The menu is a bit poorly done. The cheese options, for instance, are listed as a footnote at the top (are those still called footnotes?) where it mentions that you can add cheese or jalapeno cheese. For those unfamiliar with the White Castle menu, they'll probably just miss that option entirely.\n\n- It's WAY at the end of the strip (that is, the part furthest from the 15 freeway). Not as far as Trump Hotel, but past the Venetian. So if you're down near Excalibur, or even the Cosmopolitan, you've got a long walk ahead of you. Might be better to drive to closer hotel and walk. Harrah's parking is free and easy to access off the strip (not sure about other hotels -- do your own research).\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nGo here. It's good.\n\nSo why the low rating? I'm taking off two stars because of 1) price and 2) not having the service or taste that lives up to the Midwest experience. But it's still quite good -- I just can't justify mathematically giving it 5 stars because 5 stars would be the standard White Castle experience, which this misses. But going here was still awesome.\n\nPRO TIP: White Castles are excellent breakfast food. Let them sit overnight -- keep the burger cases overlapping to trap the moisture in! -- then let them sit out overnight and enjoy the next day.\n\nAlways consume with ketchup.\n\nHELPFUL INFO for the uninitiated:\n\nWhite Castle sliders are tiny and come standard with chopped, slightly grilled onion, and a pickle. No mustard or ketchup. You have to ask for ketchup packets if you want, but it's easier to bring your own bottle so you don't spend your meal opening and squeezing out 30 packets.\n\nFor guys with a young appetite, you could easily consume 10 sliders. Something like 6 might be enough for you.\n\nWomen and girls with lesser appetites might be satisfied with 2-4 sliders.\n\nDon't forget to try out their other stuff, like jalapeno cheese, onion rings, etc. It's all good stuff.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

So I replied with what are your options. She was just rude about it and for some reason wouldn't tell me. I got frustrated so I just told her to tell me the ones they have so I can choose and if you can't do that then I want one of every condiment there is to offer. She finally told me and I got what I wanted, but all this altercation was very unnecessary. \n\nThis place is pricy, has little food for what you pay for, busy, and has rude workers.

We placed our order at the cashier and then head to the soda fountain to fill up our drinks. Before we are finished filling up our drinks, the man (5'8-5'10 with short hair) at the front counter is already calling out our number to pick up our order. I'm already trying my best and hurried up filling up our drinks so I can pick up the order. But within seconds after the first number call, the man at the front counter started to sound impatient and angry when he calls (yelling and screaming) out our number for the second and third time. I'm appreciative that they provide fast service on the orders, but the man really scared us and made us feel forced\/rushed, it was very unprofessional!\n\nNote (02\/26\/2015): This location barely just opened and it's the first location on the west coast, it's already at 2.5 star overall rating on Yelp, it's shameful and embarrassing.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":0}

I ordered 1 slider (just to try it) and the 9 piece chicken rings. Slider was about $1.29 each (which I'm told is more expensive than their usual locations, probably because it's Vegas).\n\nSuper disappointed. The whole slider can probably be ate in 1 bite and it just melts in your mouth in a bad way. You dont even need to chew. I'm all for soft buns, like shake shack buns, but this reminded me of wonder bread, which is probably as artificial as it gets... There's also little to no patty. Chicken rings were basically flattened out pieces of chicken cut into being shapes. They were like onion rings. You also have to ask them for ketchup.\n\nYeah, its probably the cheapest you can get in Vegas, but its also just low quality food that you should probably just skip.

They dont have an extras section on the menu - for example if you want to add an extra slider to your combo. \n4). If you're sitting by the door of the entrance to the place, during the Volcano show at the Mirage hotel across the street, you can feel the heat blowing at you when the door is open.

Unfortunately, the term still holds true despite of being in this side of the country!  Engorged 3 sliders and things began to go downhill from there.  I'd like to keep this review as clean as possible so look up reviews on Amazon regarding sugar-free Haribo gummy bears to give you a better idea of what actually went down.  If this were your first time, consider yourself warned and eat at your own risk!\n\nAfter hearing about the grueling wait in line for the past several days following its grand opening, we came in around 4 o'clock Sunday morning thinking there wouldn't be anyone in the establishment.  Instead, we walked in to one of the worst mistakes we've done in awhile.  To our surprise, the place itself was swarming with drunk people from nightclubs around the area.  It almost felt like a nightmare coming in sober; as if someone was about to get shot\/stabbed at any moment.  At least you can get $1 beers from the bar right across the fast food joint to help you get acclimated with the whole scene if you happen to find yourself in the same situation.  \n\nWe ended up waiting for over 50 minutes just to order and another 15 to get our food.  The sliders were just as good when I had it in Chicago.  For those having it for the first time, however, they're fairly similar from what you can get at Costco.  This might even be worse as they were rather cold once I started eating them.\n\nOverall, White Castle is definitely bringing in the masses for their infamous sliders.  As much as I'd like not to come back at this establishment, I can see my inebriated self lining up in the near future just to get a hold of their greasy sliders to help soak up the alcohol.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":2}

The manager tells me \"you ordered almost 20 mins ago and now you tell me about the fries?...of course they're cold\". Yeah we ordered 20 minutes ago, we hadn't had our food for 20 mins. I could not believe the audacity of this idiot. I told her they were cold and stale when she gave them to us and I wasn't going to argue with a fast food employee. As a manager she should've been accommodating especially since we just spent close to $30. I told her she could keep her fries, left them on the counter, and left. White Castle food is trash and their management reflects their product. I will NEVER waste my $$ or time there again.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Since we were staying on the strip for a 3 day staycation we planned on finally trying White Castle and cross it off our list. Personally I have had no urge to try this popular east coast chain but the hubby was adamant in trying it at least once. Ummmm NO, not going back. Lol. \n\nAfter trekking the unforgiving 110 degree Vegas heat from the Flamingo, we arrived at the very well lit White Castle space inside the Casino Royale. The area is decorated modestly and everywhere you looked was clean hence the extra star because reality is, all I can give for the quality food wise is 1 star.\n\nWe ordered 2 cheese slider combos ($8.99 each) which consisted of: 4 cheese sliders, regular size fries and a drink; Large order of the onion chips ($2.99) the buy 'em by the sack which had 10 original sliders. All that set us back $32+ after the 10% local discount they gave us. The first couple of bites were okay but it was downhill after that, I had 3 sliders and I was fighting to down it. The middle was somewhat soggy which was very unsettling, the taste is indescribable but not in a good way. The fries and onion chips have nothing going on for them either, nothing to write home about. My daughter who likes cheeseburger barely finished one, my husband had the same sentiments, after his third one he was done. My son is the only one that liked it. I told him he can come with his cousins if the mood strikes him because there is no way you can ever bring me back here, it's just not worth the calories.

And since we were gonna be in town for the big fight weekend, I was hyping up getting a crave case at some point during the weekend. Good thing it's open 24 hours but its location is a little tricky in that you really have to be in the immediate area and just walk over because it's smack dab in the middle of the strip by Harrah's and across the street from the Mirage... I was bummed to find out that this particular White Castle location does not offer the bacon-cheese slider or the jalapeno one. LAME. The bacon and cheese one is so good. Whenever one of my relatives flies to LA from Queens they bring a crave case of that goodness but none in Vegas?? That alone is worth the deduction of 2 stars.\n\nWe got there after spending a few hours at Omnia nightclub and were all starving. Luckily the line wasnt too long. We only waited about 10-15 mins before we ordered. As soon as we sat down, the line was crazy... We ordered a crave case. That's 30 sliders. We got half classic and the other 15 with cheese. We got 4 orders of large fries and sodas. The sodas are refillable so that's good. The crinkle cut fries are decent. Some are crispy. Others were a little soggy. The sliders which I was so looking forward to were a little disappointing. Not because bacon wasnt an option but they just didnt taste as good as I remember. The weird thing was the original ones without the cheese were tastier than the ones WITH cheese. They seemed to have way more of the grilled\/steamed onions on the originals than the cheese slider. The difference in taste was significant. And I was pretty disappointed... Dont get me wrong. I still scarfed down about 6 of them bad boys but I had no choice, I was starving. But I was still disappointed because I couldnt figure out how the sliders hand-carried on the plane ride from Queens and reheated in the microwave were better than the ones right off the grill in front of me. Puzzling... I hope it improves because if someone like me whose \"lightly\" familiar with the White Castle menu is disappointed, what more for someone that's a tried & true Craver. Harold & Kumar would not approve...\n\nFunny story... As we were finishing up. A slightly tipsy and partied-out couple who didnt want to wait in the long line for their food offered us $10 for 2 sliders... SOLD. To the lush couple... Only in Vegas.\n\nService was ok. Definitely no enthusiasm from the cashier that helped us. Theyre probably over it with the characters they see on the daily... Be better White Castle Las Vegas. You should be better than that.\n\nps - cousins from Queens brought over a crave case a couple of weeks after this trip and sure enough, they were tastier. taste comparison complete... I was right.

After my recent visit, its clear to me that you have to be stoned out of your mind to enjoy this place.\n\nLocated in the decrepit Casino Royale, this White Castle is probably the main reason people even step inside this place. WC takes up a pretty big amount of real estate in the casino but don't expect to find seating or quick service. Being the only Castle on the West Coast means this place is packed; lines are long, service is poor and its not rare to see people fighting over a seat in the dining area. If you must come here, parking at Harrahs next door or Mirage across the street should be sufficiently close.\n\nThe food here from my understanding is essentially the same as it's East Coast counter parts plus a few bucks cause you are eating on the Strip. The tiny sliders come with a paper thin slice of beef, a few grilled onions and a soggy bun due to the grease. The crinkle cut fries can be found at many other mediocre fast food spots. Skip the chicken rings and go buy some frozen nuggets from Costco, you will thank me later. The food is definitely over priced, a four slider combo with cheese runs for $9. Service was abysmal and place was a mess.\n\nWhile waiting in line, the party in front of us was talking about how they grew up on White Castle in New York and how excited they were to finally eat here again. I guess nostalgia must be the only way to really appreciate White Castle. Oh and maybe after smoking a bunch of weed.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":2}

I just prefer the extra meat and gooey cheese to bun ratio better than the singles. I also prefer the jalapeno cheeseburgers to the regular ones. It is not a spicy jalapeno flavor at all, just a little kick to let you know it's there. Just an added bonus for who like a little spice.\n\nThere's not much more to say. If you're looking for a gourmet burger, this is not it. But if it's late, you've lost some money at the tables, and you just want something delicious to chomp on, this is the place. The lines can get long, but who cares? It's Vegas. Grab a drink and relax. What are you in such a hurry for anyway?\n\nSIDE STORY: My wife got hit on right in front of me and I still didn't care.

My boyfriend and I came around 11 PM after watching a show since we knew the wait during the day would just be ridiculous. Thankfully we were right and the line was pretty short (25 mins) compared to what other people experienced. The line starts outside on the sidewalk and is pretty well manned and serviced by security guys. \n\nOn to the food. I wasn't that hungry but my boyfriend decided to \"Buy 'em by the sack\" since this is probably the last time we would be coming here unless we were super drunk and stumbled down this way again. The menu says 10 original sliders but they will put cheese on as many of them as you like which costs you a bit extra. We also got extra grilled onions (which can be added for free). The crinkle cut fries were good but don't think they were any different than ones you get from other fast food joints (just a bit more soggy). The sliders with the cheese were definitely better. They may not seem that big but you can tell you are just putting a whole load of grease down into your stomach.\n\nOnto the aftermath of eating those sliders...man what are those things actually made of! The next morning I was soooooo gassy! So I'm not sure what those tiny little meat patties are made of or how much oil and grease is used to make the burger but man that was noooot pleasant.

And then then the employee left and came back and started telling the guy inappropriate stuff. That was unnecessary drama, but I still love the burgers !","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Located in the Best Western Casino Royale, in between Venetian and Harrah's, they're open 24\/7, perfect for late night munchies and as expected for a Vegas spot! There's a direct entrance off the strip so you don't have to go through the casino floor.

Just 10 sliders short of a crave case cardboard box, which meant our order was packed slightly discreetly in a paper bag with a plastic bag instead. LoL. Sliders come with bun, patty, pickle, and onions. Cheese is an extra $6 (about 33 cents per slider) for the #9 combo and was well worth it! I bit into the slider with low expectations because I've been searching for them for so long and I didn't want to hype up the slider only to be disappointed. I wasn't. Flavorful and all gone in 4 bites (2 for the BF). Enough flavor on its own. You can also politely ask for some sauce (meant for dipping chicken tenders but oh well). I used ranch, BBQ and zesty zing on some of the sliders. Even though we ordered and took it to go, and made the 15 minute trek back to our hotel room to enjoy, the burgers were slightly damp, but still good! \n\nHow successful were we in finishing the entire order?

To my surprise a young man that was in line at the front front got upset because the people that were working we're laughing and doing nothing instead of working he being frustrated hit his cup off the counter counter.

Fred the manager who was a woman I say that because I think they gave me the wrong name of the young lady but if Fred's the name Fred's the name Fred got mad at the young man for noticing that her workers weren't working and instead of apologizing threatened to give the money back, at first he was reluctant just wanted some ketchup but when that was a chore he said yes give me my money back. I just want to say that this made everyone get hands on deck when I say everyone's hands were moving they were all moving and I don't know if it was because Fred came out or if it was because the young man made a fuss but what I know is that I got my food a little bit quicker than I would have had he had not said anything... and he didn't even get to eat.

People are either fanatics or hate it.  Personally, I fall in the former category.  Their fries are delicious, the sliders are unique, offering a steamed variation on the burger.  And the toppings are minimal yet effective.  For the first time, I got a chicken ring sliders which was pretty good and seemed to offer a sizable piece of chicken.  In N' Out may be a little better, but White Castle is great as well.  Having the closest location to Los Angeles, I stopped at the Vegas White Castle for a Crave Case.  I went for the Cheeseburger Sliders, which run about $41 for a case of 30.  Although I remember them having ketchup, when I asked for them to hold the ketchup, I was informed they came without ketchup, but did have pickles which I did not remember.  These ones were not quite as steamed or good as some of the east coast locations, but hey, I'm eating White Castle so who am I to complain?!  I'm not sure that the pickles were needed and as they sit in my freezer while I work my way through the case, I may regret getting a smaller order and going for the frozen ones at home, but so far I have yet to be too disappointed.

Uhm it's a thing here now.  Honestly it has been a thing here for about a decade.  I say this because it tastes exactly the same as the frozen microwave burgers.  Exactly? Well not really because there is a pickle in these ones.  \n\nThe location is on the strip in the small casino north of the Venetian by the Linq parking lot. It's very fast paced and as soon as we ordered we weren't able to fill up our drinks halfway before our order of 20 cheese sliders, 9 piece chicken rings, onion chips and fries were done.  \n\nTo say the least it was not the most rewarding way for me to break my pescetarian seafood diet.  At best it could be said that you could enjoy the satisfaction that us West coasters can now join the likes of dining in an East coast fast food institution.  Not as rewarding as the opposite experience is for East coasters trying a Double Double & Animal Style Fries from In & Out for the first time.  \n\nWe got hugely full sharing a 10 pack of sliders for 2 and the baby loved the chicken rings though.  We brought the second 10 pack home for my little bro.  Sadly he had to microwave them slightly by then.  Completely rehashing the same old feeling of eating them the frozen way.  He noted that it was cheaper and more convenient to have just got them at the freezer section.  They may even use the exact ingredients at the restaurant?\n\nIt was fun.  Everyone should try it at least once.

First things first, White Castle does not serve a killer gourmet 16 ingredient big burger.  They're small simple classic sliders from the oldest American fast food chain.  People who have had them both crave it and are nostalgic for it.  Bottom line is to appreciate for what it is.  Simple.\n\nWe went here on a Harold and Kumar esk trek from Downtown LV.  The location is convenient to guests of the Casino Royale or any strip hotel connected to it.  Way less convenient for all others.  We parked in Harrah's which is fairly close and you can walk to the joint inside the casino as Harrah's and Casino Royale are connected.  Parking is free and the walk is less than 5 mins. \n\nI've heard a lot about the insane lines so we opted to go when all others are asleep at 5am.  Yes, burgers for breakfast!!  Walked up and ordered in less than 2 minutes and food served 5 minutes after that.  Employees were friendly and obviously over whelmed by the onslaught of customer pouring in all day.  I was impressed they were so positive and that's certainly not been my experience in White Castles past.  The crew were bantering with each other making for a positive vibe which was nice especially if you've getting beat down by the casinos.\n\nI'd say enjoy the multitude of employees that are working in anticipation of the crowds because when it's slow its still fresh and super fast.\n\nThere's a couple of workers constantly cleaning so the place is well kept and clean.  Another nice change based on my past experiences with this chain else where.\n\nThe set up can make the view from the strip looking in deceiving.  While it may look like there's a large crowd it could just be people eating their food and standing around.  The dining area is toward the strip and the ordering area is inward.  I'd say a good rule is if you see a line extending out doors then ok it's a long line.  Else you should check inside cause the line may not be that long.\n\nWe had the 20 originals with 2 fries combo for $28.  Just over a buck each which is standard.  They could gouge us but I'm glad to see they didn't.  \n\nWe have eaten these many times so having these without being in the mid west is a treat indeed.   These little suckers and simple and tasty.  Soft bun, slim patty, grilled onions and a garlic-esk seasoning makes em tasty.  They pretty much melt in your mouth which I love.  Swallow em whole I say (I can't btw)!  Average person can probably eat about 3-5.  We had 10 each.  Don't Judge!!!  We weren't drunk or stoned.\n\nFries are crinkle cut and crispy.  Add some salt.  Get one order fries for every 5 sliders.\n\nBottom line is that it's a White Castle for those who have had em.  The same except this one is very modern and much cleaner than those I've been.  For Noobs, don't buy into the hype.  Keep in mind, where these are from, they are very convenient, never crowded, and relatively cheap.  Don't expect a miracle in a burger and you'll find they are great by their own right.  These things have character like that cool friend everyone knows but nobody sees.  \n\nLooking forward to having more next time I'm in town.  Congrats Vegas!  Lucky you.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I've only experienced the frozen kind that you buy at your local markets. With that said, and with rave reviews of friends and family, my experience here was anti climatic. I'll have to admit that the fresh ones were slightly better than the frozen one you make at home. These famous sliders are steamed on a bed of grilled onions with a very thin slice of hamburger,  (And I mean thin. I suppose so that it could cook faster) and topped with a bun to also steam. If you want cheese, that is extra. Your slider also contains a pickle. If you want double meat that would be extra as well. I had order the cheese slider combo. It came with 4 sliders, fries or onion chips, and a drink. This cost about $9. Prices are a bit high for what you are receiving. That is to be expected considering it is on the Las Vegas Strip.

Great recommendation!  It's like onion rings but in wedge form. Burgers were nothing spectacular; steamed mini buns with grilled onions, processed cheese, a pickle, and a ham-like slice of hamburger. This place is overrated but makes a good and inexpensive snack (individual burgers are $1.29). Do keep in mind that each burger is the size of a dinner bun.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I wasn't impressed because a burger can only go so far with flavor, especially White Castle's concept with simple sliders with just meat, buns, optional cheese, onions and pickles. But they're still good and easy to eat. They're also fun to eat. Their food is a cute portion, which allows you to order more of them, or just sticking to a nice small portion that we should be eating haha. \n\nTaste-wise: their burgers honestly taste like McDonald's dollar cheeseburgers to me, BUT BETTER. I stress the better because i'm comparing them to McDonald's. White Castle has better buns, better meat, and better sides for sure. Their onion chips are my faaaaavorite. The chicken rings are okay, dry if anything but a good change if you want chicken as your side. And their french fries remind me of cafeteria fries, and i like cafeteria food. \n\nWhite Castle is cheap, which is a plus. They aren't trying to sell gourmet food so don't expect gourmet burgers. They're just simple, small, and not bad at all. I can see White Castle doing very well in SoCal and be highly competitive with all of SoCal's other burger joints, seriously. It would be a nice addition to fast food joints i can choose from. \n\nI'm just deducting one star because their food isn't anything out of the ordinary (what do you expect with fast food though?)--but i'm sure that wasn't their goal to begin with, sober at least.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

That excitement did a complete 180 Right after opening the bag, as it smelled like landfill or some type of sewage leak but of course I ignored it and proceeded to pull a couple regular sliders out of the bag and a chicken ring slider as well. Even though I was really hungry this stuff was so hard to swallow and digest. The sliders are almost as bad as dog food, actually I wouldn't even feed this to a poor little pup. The chicken ring sliders weren't as horrible but still tasted like dry cardboard. \n\nI now understand why Harold and Kumar craved this place when they were high, because being high has to be the ONLY POSSIBLE WAY TO ENJOY THE FOOD HERE.","useful":5,"funny":10,"cool":3}

They lay down the minced and semi cooked onions on the flat cooking area, cook and reduce the juices a bit, then lay the frozen patties on top of the onions, then they lay the bread on top and let the onion steam cook the patty, thus the gray color.

The hype is just all it is \"HYPE\" nothing special, just something different. We don't have many options in Vegas for Sliders so this could be a main destination on your list. Location is kind of goofy and not very accessible to the local folk would like to grab a quick bite. You have to find some where to park on the strip and walk which is fine, but like I stated quick bite it isn't happening. Now to the food, Burgers are pretty decent no onions for me, but the onion flavor is echoing off the bun which gives it that classic White Castle aroma. Instead of hard microwave buns now they are soft and fresh and the burger is made right in front of me instead of in a factory  which makes it a plus. Now to the best item at White Castle the Chicken Rings. It reminded me of the old recipe Chicken Nuggets at BK. Reminded me of my childhood which resulted in yet another plus.

However, it's a way for people not from the Midwest or the East Coast to experience this cornerstone of American culture and history.\n\nI was quite disappointed when I tasted the overly hyped White Castle offering at Las Vegas Foodie Fest. It was very mediocre and I couldn't believe that they would eat this stuff fanatically. When they decided to open an actual restaurant in response to the crowds, I decided that I'd have to give it a shot. Perhaps the sliders at Foodie Fest weren't quite \"the real thing.\"\n\nI parked at Harrah's. You might consider the Mirage across the street, the Venetian to the north, or the Linq slightly farther south, but I think Harrah's is pretty convenient. I happened to bypass the line (it's possible if you take a side door or just walk through Casino Royale) because I wasn't looking to stand in line at all. The line was watched by private security and extended onto the sidewalk outside the \"White Castle\" door.\n\nThe menu prices tend to be absurd, so I was really glad that Antonia R. and Renzo were kind enough to share some of their large order. Not that anyone should wander in here alone, but you really should share a 10-slider sack or a \"Crave Case\" of 30 sliders with friends\/family if you don't want to end up paying $8 for four tiny sliders, awful fries, and a cheap soda.\n\nIn light of that comment, I'll discuss the sides first. The french fries are really, really bad. They're soggy crinkle-cut fries with barely any crispiness or salt. Pretty much every other fast food chain can beat this handily. The onion chips, on the other hand, are surprisingly awesome. They're crunchy and not overly greasy. They're like onion rings but in a small enough size so that you won't have that issue of eating the entire onion portion while trying to bite the onion ring into smaller pieces. Definitely skip the fries and get the onion chips if you come here.\n\nAs I'd anticipated, the sliders here had much more flavor than whatever they were serving before. You can taste some savory flavors from the almost paper-thin patties, enjoy the soft bun, and notice the grilled onions and pickle. I actually found the cheese on the cheese sliders to be a distraction. The cheese just obscured the other flavors without providing much flavor of its own. Order the original sliders.\n\nLook, you really shouldn't go here unless you've never been to White Castle. You'll get more meat at a lower price at pretty much any other fast food place, even those on the Strip. But if you do decide that you must have the experience, make sure you're aware of the prices and strongly consider bringing a group.","useful":10,"funny":4,"cool":2}

Luckily, without planning our hotel was not too far from the White Castle that we stumbled upon our first night in town casino hopping. It is located inside the Royale Casino, which was another amazing find (cheap drinks), but that will be another review.  \n\nWe got in a long line and waited eagerly. We ordered a number 9 which included 20 original sliders and 2 regular French fries for $25.99. We added cheese and the total was around $35. Amanda took our order. She was patient, polite, and informative on our questions. Give Amanda a raise. We took our booty back to our room and began to pig out after a long night. I was surprised to bite into pickles on the burgers. Prior, I had only tried the frozen White Castle burgers, no pickles came on them. After the two of us devoured all we could we quickly realized that we had ordered way too much food for two people. There were MANY burgers left over. I am glad I checked this one off my list, and didn't have to travel to the East Coast to do so.

I ordered two veggie sliders. I was told that I'd have to wait an extra 10 mins or so because they don't get ordered often so they take a little more time. That was no problem. We also got onion chips, fries, mozzarella sticks, & drinks & normal sliders for her. While we waited we talked to some nice older gentlemen who sat next to us since it was so full they needed a place at our table to have anywhere to eat. They told us about how back in the day when they were young they went to White Castle after getting stoned & also told us about the old uniforms. They were really funny & nice so that was a fun quirk of being there.\n\nI enjoyed the veggie sliders. They had edamame in them which I eat regularly so that was a nice treat. I'm not a huge fan of black bean burgers so edamame was a nice alternative! I loved having a veggie option available so I give lot's of props to White Castle for doing that when many other places will not consider people who do not eat (don't eat a lot) of meat.

My friends and I were waiting in line outside (as shown in my picture), but I coudn't take any pictures of the savory burgers and fries because my friends and I devoured them! I love how each burger comes in its own box, or else they'll all just get squished together. It's such a simple burger, yet it tastes so flavorful. I've been taking trips to Vegas with my parents and brother since I was born, so I'm not sure why they've never introduced me to this!!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This place is inside a casino but has about 10 tables, is stylized like the East coast locations, and has an assembly crew to handle the giant lines.  Expect about a 20-30 minute wait when you go to order.\n\nI love these little burgers, they are the size of a post-it note and about 2 inches tall. Each one is served in a small cardboard box. I like the original without cheese (its just a greasy bun, onions, and patty), the wife likes the ones with cheese.  We pick up 15-20 when we are in the mood for them and these hit the spot from this location.\n\nThese will not stack up against \"premium burger\" joints, they are not a premium burger.  This is your 2 am burger where you got a hangover and you need grease.  This is what you get, greasy, greasy goodness. If you want great beef flavor, go to one of the million other burger joints on the strip.\n\nIf you order any of the sides beware, they are all mediocre. Imagine going to a Burger King and ordering fried chicken... Are you really surprised that it sucks? If you go to White Castle, just get the burgers, skip the rest. If you get the rest, that is on you...\n\nThe price is a little more than the locations on the East Coast but when everyone else is price gauging on the strip, you can't blame White Castle for doing the same... Worth a try if you have never had it, but do yourself a favor, drink a yard long margarita with a few extra shots first.  That will put you in the right state of mind for White Castle.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

How much did they get paid or how much did they smoke? Also, what was Harold thinking?\n\nBefore I go on a rant let's try to find the positives and try to write an unbiased review minus any hype. First off all the servers were incredibly friendly. The menu was easy to read basically pick a number between 1 and 100 to determine how many mini boxes you will get. Everything on the menu is colorful and photogenic. \n\nCliff notes Summary:\n1. Equal or lesser quality to the frozen store brand\n2. If your mind is telling you no but your stomach says yes. Ignore that urge to go.\n3. Taste like a half star better version of McDonald's but someone cut your burger in a square and gives smaller ingredients. \n4. When I was done eating my friends first reaction was Can we go now? While my reaction was can I eat somewhere else as a do over for this meal. \n5. Sad face. \n\nWarning Rant ahead...\n\nThe HYPE. First to address the hype before the review. I'm sure 99.9% of the people walking in the door watched Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. I even heard a rumor that a White Castle would be open in Hollywood to promote the movie. False. The closest White Castle to CA at that time was in Chicago but eventually a location came to Las Vegas. The only promise of enjoying a small slider in the frozen form after getting the munchies from a mind altering substance legal in some states was the only way for some people to get a taste. The idea of a fresh burger drew all of us here.\n\nWhere is the line?... I freaked out thinking... I hope this place isn't packed during lunchtime on a Friday. There was no line just 1 person taking their time ordering and other employees taking their time filling the order. The food is served in little boxes. My first temptation was to order a lot but I calm myself down and decided to start with the 4 sliders combo (2 cheese, 2 plain and fries). Visually, when I received the items it was disappointing compared to the colorful menu pictures. The slider fills about 2\/3 of the box (with a 70% bun to meat ratio) and the rest is just air and paper. If only the boxes were etible I would have more food... think a kids happy meal only smaller. \n\nThe ingredients mimic McDonald's. The pickle, cheese, mustard, onions etc without lettuce or tomato. Only the slider patty is seasoned differently and the bread is like a 99 cent store roll. I can see the appeal of eating 30 boxes... I mean sliders but I rather have a 1 pound burger. Also, sliders are served everywhere in standard bar food and even Dennys is a lot better. I sure there is a disclaimer that reads only consume with alcohol and or other possibly illegal subtances.\n\nIn California, I am spoiled with the burger options and no In N out is not amazing it's the Honda Civic of burgers there good and reliable but there are better  options.  It's a good thing this place is Las Vegas. I can't speak for the rest of the country but if this is your only option I can understand the love for White Castle but if you've tried other options you will be sadly disappointed. If you want a burger you can hold in 2 hands this is not the place. \n\nThe location is not easily accessible since it faces The Strip. If you are not walking around this general area it is a bit of a walk. I don't recommend going as a fast food option on your last day when leaving  Las Vegas. I parked at Venetian and walked past so many great affordable eating places on the way to White Castle. I feel like an idiot now, after the disappointment of my lunch choice. \n\nIn conclusion, just don't do it. My mistake was I had Shake Shack the day before and I ignored my brain that warned me about the hype. Fool me once shame on me but fool my twice F U. If you are a fan do whatever floats your boat but if you are trying for the first time just don't go. There is very little room left for improvement. White Castle is for people that enjoy McDonald's but want a smaller snack with food that taste like it came from the frozen section of a grocery store.","useful":1,"funny":3,"cool":1}

Usually 4 or 6 etc. They are served in those signature boxes. We just got the cheeseburgers for our first time experience. The food is a BIG BIG \"MEHHHH\". \n\nNothing special at all. Like I said, taste as good as it looks, and it's not much to look at. \n\nThis location is located inside the Casino Royale. It has it's own entrance from outside the strip, but it is not an isolated space of it's own. Once you go inside you will see the casino floor on the right.

The exterior and interior design of the building is very well done - nice stone work on the exterior and great use of wall graphics inside. Surprisingly, the floor plan works very well, especially considering the long narrow nature of the space they had to work with. Having security was a good idea - it helped keep traffic flowing. \n\nAs for the hamburgers themselves, they were very well cooked. We enjoyed double cheese, regular White Castles and cheeseburgers as well as fries. And you always have to top it off with a Coca Cola. The burgers were cooked very well - in fact they were some of the best I've had in a long time. Some people think they are greasy but it is actually the steam cooking process that results in a nice soft and somewhat juicy bottom bun. Everything was very fresh and hot off the grill.  We also enjoyed their krinkle fries. These were good as well, though I am more a fan of sweet potato fries.\n\nWith White Castle, you either love them or hate them. I suppose I love them - and the Las Vegas location did not disappoint. Customer service was very good as well. I had the opportunity to have brief conversations with several of the staff and they all seemed to be genuinely enjoying their new workplace. They had cleaning staff making sure the front room was clean as a whistle and that recently vacated seats were ready for new customers. It was also good to see they incorporated the Vegas theme in the signage, including a slot machine menu sign.\n\nAll in all our visits to the new White Castle in Las Vegas were very enjoyable. The quality of food and service was great. We highly recommend it to all relocated East Coast Nevadans.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Once you're inside, it's another 10-15 people. It took us about 30 min to get our food. Once you place your order, you are given a number, and once your food is ready, they call your number to pick it up. The lady would repeatedly call out the same number for a minute or two until the order was picked up. That certainly didn't add any great ambience to our dining experience.\n\nAs of 2\/2\/15 their menu was not quite extensive as the menu on-line. They don't have fish burgers or onion rings.

I mean these peeps have lived on them and this is the comfort food of their generation.  It is so cool, that I, being a West Coaster, was able to learn about how WC was part of people's lives!!!\n\nThe Wait - Not so bad. We went at 9:30 on Sunday right after Church..... We prayed for a short line and our total wait to be in line, order and then get the food was only 30 minutes.  When we left at 10:20, there was actually no one in line in the street and only about 25 people waiting inside.\n\nThe Food Experience - It is certainly interesting that you are paying about a $1.10 to $1.20 for a slider. It is very expensive overall.  However, that being said, that little itty bitty piece of meat, that is razor thin and about 2\"x2\", with the two pickles and a quarter piece of processed cheese and chopped grilled onions is not bad. The bread is very soft and the perfect taste. Not too tasty and not bland. Just right. This little slider will not win any taste awards, but it is very edible and certainly evokes memories for so many.  This falls in line with grilled cheese and chicken noodle soup or even Mac and Cheese as go to comfort foods that is just right.\n\nThe Food rating - Nevertheless, lets face it, man cannot live on fond memories alone and so, the quality taste of the food has to be key and in this case, the Sliders themselves do not taste very good at all. They are pretty basic actually.  The crinkle fries are absolutely horrible and I would suggest naming them droopy fries, because they lack any crispiness at all. These are the most floppy and soggy fries ever. The amount you pay for the quantity you get is absolutely laughable.  We ordered loaded fries as well and these were looking like some 10 year old whipped it up and put it together.  There is not an ounce of artistic gourmet quality in this little burgers.\n\nThe Service - Not bad. The security that helps the line flow are very good quality. the cashiers are a bit new and this is taking a bit of time. They are not totally connected with the entire process and ordering and etc.  \n\nBuy why? - I wonder why put this  small restaurant in such a location? Horrible location, small, no easy way to get here if you are local.\n\nI will be coming back, with friends or guest, but not for the burgers, for the experience. Out of context and just taken alone, the burgers are just as good as twinkies and hoho's are to desserts. In the context of the whole experience, very good place to go.\n\nGK says, check it out.","useful":9,"funny":3,"cool":7}

White Castle is an ACQUIRED TASTE.  People who have grown up on In-N-Out or Fatburger or (insert burger chain here) probably aren't going to appreciate the food here, and that's fine (though, if you try them and love them; PROPS! and welcome to the club). Let me make one point though; it is possible that none of those places would exist if not for this burger chain. White Castle is the OG of fast food, established in 1921, and pioneered many of the technologies still in use today throughout the industry.\nThis is the first , and only White Castle in The West. Like all White Castles, it is clean, and service is friendly and fast. It is located inside a casino, so that's different.\nNow, about the food; here's what to expect; the burgers are small and thin, and there are reasons for that. The truly unique thing about sliders (and please stop calling other places' mini-burgers sliders; they're not sliders, they're just small burgers) is how they are cooked. The meat never touches the flattop. It is laid on top of a bed of onions and cooked with the onion steam. This is why the meat is flattened so thin (and has holes poked in it); a thick patty would never cook with this sort of indirect heat. The bun is also laid on top of the cooking meat so that it gets steamed also. This results in a very soft, some would say soggy, bun. These features make White Castle burgers unique (well, almost unique; the southern Krystal chain makes burgers this way since they copied White Castle's model back in 1932). The burgers are served with the onions they are cooked on and a single pickle slice. As you can imagine, the cooking and serving method results in a burger with a lot of onion flavor. If you don't like grilled onion, this burger is not for you. You can ask for mustard or ketchup, but I don't. They are also available with cheese. I can't comment on their chicken sandwiches and I never will; my childhood didn't include that and when I go to White Castle, I'm reliving a piece of that childhood as much as I'm having a meal. Having said that, take the five-star review with a grain of salt; it might be biased.  ;-)","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":0}

I personally think the frozen ones are better than the ones I had yesterday from the new location on the strip.  At 2AM we still waited at least 15 minutes.  All we ordered were regular burgers.  You could see they were rushing to complete orders and voila when we got our 8 sliders they were not very good.  3 of 8 had no pickles (we did not order them that way) and on all of them the onions were still mostly raw and overpowering.  Overall, based on the visit, I will not return.  Considering the frozen ones cost abo.ut 50 cents each from Costco or when they are on sale at the grocery store, why go to the strip to pay double for an iconic slider that didn't taste all that great with mostly raw and overpowering onions.  This is a post script:  I just came home from Sam's Club where I purchased 18 White Castle Cheeseburgers for about $11 and they are way better than the sliders we got on the strip a few weeks ago.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Located above a cheap hotel, this restaurant is more spacious than it looks, with several grilling tables that can seat about 8 or so people at once. We had a reservation for 7 and had to wait for another family to arrive before the chef could prepare all our food since it is cooked at the same time. Even after they arrived, it was a long wait. Avoid this place at all costs if you have allergies since everything is cooked on the same grill with the same utensils. \n\nThe concept is simple, you pick your choice of meats, either one, two or three choices which will be served with soup, salad, vegetables, rice and noodles plus ice cream for dessert. Oddly the noodles were spaghetti pasta mixed with bean sprouts, cooked in a teriyaki or soy sauce and sesame type seasoning. \nTheir sauce makes everything you order taste more or less the same, its sweet and easy to please but I have no clue if any of the food was representative of true Japanese teppanyaki. The chef used a lot of butter to make up for flavor. \n\nAs for the show experience, our chef started off with good enthusiasm and tried his best to crack jokes but everyone could tell it was the same lines he uses with everyone and it ended up feeling dated and tired. There was no fancy knife works, flip of utensils, or special food presentation such as the stacking of onion rings into a little volcano or cracking of eggs into the rice. Basically most things I expected from watching videos and TV were lacking. There was this moment where he did set the shrimp on fire when spraying it with oil and that was the most entertaining bit. It raised the rooms temperature by a lot, beware, this restaurant gets really hot especially with the low ceilings, and constant burning of the gas grills, all I smelt were fumes and ended up getting dizzy. \n\nAfter almost 3 hours we finally left and felt disappointed that it ended up being more expensive than we thought. Even with the coupon we purchased, we felt it wasn't quite worth for the quality of food or entertainment. Other than the protein, things like rice and beans sprouts really cost pennies and that's what I got full from.

Un peu trop sucré, ce qui peut tomber sur le cœur à la longue, mais le daikon (radis) mariné permet de changer le goût entre deux bouchées. Le poulet était bien croustillant et goûtait bon, mais ne vaut pas le prix demandé. \n\nPrix: \nÀ ce prix, on peut se permettre de bien meilleur repas dans le coin. \n\nAmbiance:\nIl y a des places assises, mais c'est un petit restaurant. Ambiance pour jeunes universitaires ou famille plutôt que pour un souper romantique. Il y a une tv avec musique coréenne.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

So I became wary and decided to order less. Well, looking back, thank f*ck for that. I don't go about spending 20$+ at KFC, so why would I do so here?\n\nTurns out, the speciality fried chicken is probably just a less oily version of pop corn chicken from Popeye's, or some sort of general tao chicken. But if you don't pay 14$ for half a plate of general tao chicken (24$ for a full plate), why do so here -- and, what's korean about it? We had the garlic and soya boneless fried chicken (tastes just like tao chicken), because the 2 other 'flavours' are 'classic' and 'spicy' -- very interesting choices hmm.\n\nAnyway the other thing that reviewers raved about is the 'buldak', or in english, extra spicy chicken... Extra spicy turned out to be extra disappointing. Basically, it's a stir fry of chicken with onions, carrots, and daikons in a korean sauce (dry rub in water). Annnnd it wasn't barely spicy. Price-wise, it's 20$ for that average sized plate (refer to pictures below)... which is a good 150% the price of what it is worth. \n\nNow some of you are saying 'well you haven't tried their chicken wings'. My answer: fk datttt. If the boneless chicken is already kinda dry, I don't want to think about how tough the wings are going to be when the heat finally cooks through the bones. \n\nWhat I liked about this place though, is that bell you can ring for service, and they give 10% off for people with the MCSS card. \nIt was pretty spacious and K-pop videos are played on two TV screens. \nThe owners were pretty nice, but I figured that they'd better be extra nice, because what they're cashing in for their KFC rip off is quite a stunt (and definitely worth that 4.5\/5). But as much as their food goes, it's a 2.5\/5: no go.","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":2}

It was interesting seeing that they had an electronic device that you could ring to call the waiter. However I do think that for a small size restaurant like this one, one should be able to communicate directly with the server with the wave of a hand or an eye contact. \nFood does look good on picture, but it can get dull if you order only chicken. Don't get me wrong, the fried chicken is tasty and well cooked. We tried both the original and the garlic\/soya sauce, both were very good, I recommend the combo plate with half of both.\nPrice point is a little bit high for fried chicken, especially because it doesn't come with any sides. You can order either a half chicken or whole, with bones or without. I would suggest ordering a whole chicken and splitting it in 2-3, since the portions aren't that big.\nThis is definitively a heavy meal, and I would've appreciated it if it came with a salad and rice (they probably have a plate like this for lunch, but they should make it available for diner as well). Rice has to be ordered separately, and there weren't much choice for healthy veggies on the menu. Funny thing that happened during my visit was that we were told that they sold out on rice! How does that even happen in an asian restaurant? I was quite surprised since it was around 7pm. \nTLDR; somehow expensive, cute decor, dry meal, quick fix, slow service, share plates, eat your 8-9 portions of fruits\/vegetables at home.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

As far as I'm concerned, it's the best in the West Valley.\"  Really?  The best?  \n\nI admit that, when it comes to Chinese food, there isn't much in the West Valley.  Then again, unless we're talking Mexican, there isn't much in the West Valley ... period.  It's been that way since I came out here in 1993; it'll probably be that way after I die of food poisoning from one of these stellar places (and after one of the restaurant owners I've reviewed reads one of my contributions, the \"food poisoning\" may not be so accidental or coincidental).\n\nFirst, I really like the nearly all-wood decor of the place.  I know the \"fashion\" for those who aren't old and obsolete dinosaurs is plastic and glass.  Whatever.  I like wood.  It gives a warm and cozy feeling and this place has it  (the ceiling with twinkling stars ... ehhh ... it's okay).\n\nWe had the family dinner for two.  The price ($23.95 + tax without drinks) is reasonable.  The Hot n Sour soup was tasty:  filled with peanut oil just like the Hot n Sour Soup I'm used to from back East.  A little light on the meat and a bit too sweet for my tastes, but acceptable.  The egg rolls had nearly no meat and were very crisp.  Frankly, I LIKE all-vegetable and crispy egg rolls and the tighter the cabbage is packed in, the better.  Cheese puff ... okay.  Wasn't supposed to be a \"crab puff\", so they're not trying to deceive and it was tasty.\n\nNow the main meal.  This is where the place gets less \"amazing\".  I had the Szechuan Chicken and am wondering if maybe they brought the wrong dish?  I've never had a version of this dish, where the chicken was crispy coated and the sauce was sweet.  My other half had the Kung Pao Chicken and it was, sadly, standard for second-rate Chinese restaurants:  small cubes of celery, bamboo, zucchini ... and smaller cuts of, I think, chicken.  Neither tasted bad; neither overwhelmed.\n\nService was fast ... one might say, \"too fast\":  in a take-out situation, you WANT them falling over each other.  At a sit down meal, you really don't want them bringing courses before you're done with the previous one.  As I said to my fellow diner, \"The only thing missing is them standing in a corner, watching expectingly and waiting to swoop down on us as we took our last bite.\"\n\nSo, in conclusion, while I agree that the pickings in Avondale\/Goodyear are slim, this is no excuse to tolerate something one step above the food court in Target.  If you really think this place is something to give 4 or 5 stars to, then I beg you to either get in your car and drive the 20 miles into Phoenix to find something more palatable or, if you don't have a car, drop me a line and we'll go out to dinner one day.  I'll consider it a civic duty and a generous gift to your taste buds.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

The food was always good every time, and they were always very friendly! We would generally just split an entree because they are so big, but they would still give us at least 2 fortune cookies and enough supplies for 2 people. (Many places we've ordered takeout from only give you one fortune cookie for one entree... not really a big deal since we don't even eat them, but I thought it was a nice touch here at AJK. It's the thought that counts! They are very thoughtful! :)\n\nWe recently decided to dine in for the first time, and we were just as satisfied as before. The food was the same quality as take out of course, but the service was phenomenal. It wasn't very busy at all, and everyone was extremely polite. We had Plum Wine and Oolong Tea, but quickly realized we needed some cold water with the hotness of our food! Both spicy and temperature... It was all very good though! Our favorite thing to get there is the cream cheese rangoons, and they are the best we've ever had! So delicious! I could eat tons of them for my entire meal, but I don't ;)\n\nSome of the dishes we've ordered weren't so great here, but that's just personal preference. What we do like is excellently prepared, and we've never really been disappointed. The dinner for two thing we had when we dined in was a mistake... it was more like dinner for 3 or 4!!! Or maybe we're just not American enough. One entree and 1 or 2 appetizers would be enough... the dinner for 2 came with spring rolls, cream cheese rangoons, soup, a huge plate of rice, and 2 entrees. We had tons of leftovers, which was okay with us I guess! You definitely get your money's worth here though.\n\nOh, and the place is small, but very nice inside.

They even said I can bring my own.  Im giving them a 4 because they do not offer gluten free breading or gluten free soy sauce for their meals.  The ambiance is elegant and traditional looking..very pretty.  They have bundle dinner specials, that is quite a savings.

The noodles are passable; I've certainly had better.\n\nMy friend, who recently ate his way through Japan, said it compares favourably with what you'll get at most places there, and I would rate it just slightly lower than my favourite of all time, Saiwaii Ramen in SF.\n\nThe Osaka octupus balls are *insanely* rich, and even six is far too many for two people, consisting as they do of soft cheese (I only found out later that this is what they are made of ... glad I didn't know before I ordered them ... also since when do Japanese dishes involve dairy?!?) doused in super-sweet teriyaki sauce.  I loved the shaved dry octopus on top.

When we arrived, the place wasn't that packed and only 3 tables were filled. After we sat down, a mob of people came in and almost half of the restaurant was filled! After we were seated, we took a quick glance at the menu and decided what to order. Our waitress was very attentive and took our orders promptly. I went with the Nagasaki Champon (Seafood) and my girlfriend went with \"The Kings of the Kings Ramen\" (she's so fancy)! I also ordered the Matcha Green Tea Smoothie. \n\nMy green tea smoothie took about 10 minutes to come out and it was kind of too bland for me. It had a milky but not too sweet green tea taste. It was good, but just not my kind of drink. Our food came out probably around 15 minutes after we ordered it, which isn't too bad. My seafood ramen was awesome, mostly because I love seafood and the soup base tasted great. It came with a decent amount of seafood (Shrimp, scallops, and mussels) and noodles. One minor complaint I have is that the shrimp should be unshelled, this makes it easier to eat especially when eating ramen...or maybe I'm just picky! As for my girlfriend (she's a picky eater), she thought that it was just okay. They could have gave less toppings, primarily the bean sprouts because it seemed like there were more of that than noodles. Another thing is that she didn't like the smokey flavor of the pork, but that depends on your taste. One thing that we both agree on is that the noodles had a great texture to it, it was an awesome smooth and soft texture.\n\nAs for the service, I thought our waitress did a great job. She accommodated with our requests and was very attentive. She came back often enough to not annoy us, but enough for us to request items if we needed. Our ramens didn't come out quick, but it wasn't so long that we would complain. We also got a coupon for 5$ off 25$ the next time we visit :)\n\nOverall, I had a great time and meal at Kenzo. If I am ever in the Toronto area, I would definitely come back here and try the other ramen. Not only was the is service great, the food was delicious as well.

The second time I had their Orochong ('cause youth love it ;-) ...which I found good but I actually preferred their Netsu better. Mind you that is a matter of taste, not quality. \n\nOn a positive note, the waiter came after our meal and asked what we thought of it. If perhaps it was too salty or if there was anything they could do to improve the dish.... WHAT? Really? For better or worse, I cannot even remember when was the last time I was asked that in a restaurant. It was appreciated, however due to my lack of Ramen experience, I really could not give any meaningful feedback. \n\nAs far as quality, I could not how \"authentic\" it was. I could only assume that it is not. But unlike places like Pho88, where their pho is neither authentic or that well made, this simile of Ramen was quite delicious given it's lack of authenticness. \n\nIf you have never been to Japan then I very much recommend this place. However if you HAVE been to Japan, chances are that you know better and probably just come her because the selection in Canada is so slim. \n\nHaving said that, I will keep an eye for other Ramen places to expand my palette.

Don't let that deter you, I don't mean to attach any negative connotations with \"OK\", I really really just mean it's OK. Considering ramen options in Toronto in general, it's pretty good.\n\nI like the atmosphere of this Kenzo a little more than the other ones. It's easier to be seen by waiters than the one on Dundas and it feels less gaudy than the one on Bloor. Every time I've been there it's also been quieter, with parties usually from 1~4 people. This might be why the waitresses are sometimes distracted talking to each other though, and they don't notice if you're looking expectantly their way with your meal done right away.\n\nI usually just opt for their more basic ramens. My main complaint about Kenzo ramen is it's got too much going on. Too many bean sprouts, too much saltiness to the broth, etc. I can't taste that hearty pork bone flavour in the tonkotsu ramen as well as at J-Town because of this. As a solution I always order shoyu or shio ramen and water down the broth with some water.\n\nIf you're a ramen newbie, don't worry, the food is still pretty good. If you're picky about your ramen, you may not be too impressed by Kenzo, but it's not too bad, especially when you're really craving some ramen.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The tonkotsu is also delicious but much more filling. This chain is surprisingly decent considering the people who run it are not Japanese.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I thought what a great opportunity. I can get a great deal on a nice designer dress. What I didn't know was that there were some strings attached which included delayed delivery dates, poor service, no phone call backs, and getting the wrong thing when I ordered something different. \n\nSo my story with this business starts when I bought my dress. I was quoted 4-6 months for my dress to arrive .when six months came I had not heard anything so I called the company and they said it should be arriving in the next two weeks. Well two weeks came and went and I didnt hear anything so I called again. They told me any day now it should be in. A week past and no word. So this time I went into the store to get an answer, while at the store I was told my dress wasn't suppose to come in until aug. Which is 1 year after I ordered it. I told that would not work because I was quoted earlier and I needed it for alterations. So after me dealing with them I lost all my patience so\nMy wedding planner called and she was ignored so finally my mother called and threatened credit card fraud because she had put down half for this dress and we had nothing to show for the huge sum of money we had paid. Bottom line they had charged our card and we had nothing to show for it and none of the promises they said were being followed thru with. After eight months I finally got my dress. All I can't say is I am happy i planned so far in advance. \n\n I also ordered a veil from them and when I went to pick it up it was a completely wrong. It was nothing like what i ordered . At this point all I wanted was my money back for the veil,\n\nBefore the veil came in my fiancé, groomsmen, and fathers went to ordered their tux. They had no idea how to measure them. It was a group of seven and they had to wait 20 mins before anyone even helped them. They had put the deposit down for the tux but to be honest I am so tired of dealing with them that I am going to walk away from my deposit money and take my business else where. \n\nMy advice for anyone thinking of going here for anything----- DON'T.

I am an MOH to my best friend and we just had the WORST afternoon with these people, essentially the most horrific bridal situation.\n\nMy best friend (the bride) bought her gown at the Phoenix Bridal Convention back in January through this bridal shop. The sales people were pushy the day of the convention but my friend loved her dress so much, and the price was right, so we over-looked it. The bride's mom put down half of the $$ for the dress, and they charged her credit card the wrong amount.\n\nThey were supposed to call the bride when the dress came in the first week of May, and she didn't hear from them. She basically had to call every week to finally get an answer that the dress was in the shop, and to schedule her first alterations session with their seamstress.\n\nWe show up this afternoon, the bride came in from Flagstaf, the MOB came in from Colorado for this fitting. We get there and first they cannot find her dress, of course we are panicking right away. Then they find the dress, and for some reason mixed up her appointment and thought it was at 4pm rather than 1pm, so the seamstress was not in the shop and wasn't available in the afternoon to come in. This place contracts out seamstresses, they do not have an in-house seamstress - and this was NOT made clear to the bride when she made the alterations appointment. When we asked if they could call in another seamstress, they couldn't find their contacts and didn't even understand when we asked \"how does your seamstress contracting work\" - they had no answer because they didn't even understand what that meant.\n\nFinally we decide we are going to take the dress elsewhere to get altered because the bride at this point doesn't trust this place, and wanted to get out ASAP. She got a free veil and tiara at the convention when she bought her dress, so we needed to get those items from the store and then we were going to leave. It took them an HOUR to figure out what veil and tiara she had pre-ordered, people would say they were helping us, then walk away. Essentially the worst customer service I have ever experienced.\n\nWe walked out with the bride in tears, the mother extremely angry, but at least we had the dress and no longer need to deal with these people. Long story short - DO NOT order your bridal items from this store, they are disorganized, it was disgustingly dirty in the shop, and they will rip you off without even knowing it.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0}

The choices were actually pretty good, I ended up with a garlic cheesebread appetizer, salmon stuffed chicken and vegetables for the entree and a piece of fudge cake for the dessert.\n\nThe garlic cheesebread was not what I expected. It was served on a sliced piece of ciabatta bread with very little melted cheddar cheese. It was more like eating toasted bread.

I was thinking more along the lines of an Italian dunker than half a grilled cheese sandwich.\n\nThe entree was very well done. Both the chicken and salmon were superb.  The sauce on the entree was also quite nice. The vegetables were a bit over done and were very limp and flavorless.\n\nThe dessert was also very good, and the waitress made this fun for us by playing a goofy birthday song I'd never heard before and bringing out a piece with a candle in it for one of our group members who had a birthday.\n\nI'm only giving this 3 stars though for the price. I don't think it was a very good value. At 22 pounds without beverage (almost USD$40) I feel like the portions were a bit small and the culinary value didn't quite command that sort of price.

So, I walked in to the Dysart location and stood in line for fifteen minutes and then waited ten more minutes for my food.  My opinion: meh.  Their fries are good, but their burger is nothing special.  Five Guys and Whataburger beat it hands down, every day of the week.

When fries have thick layer of crisp on the outside, it reminds me of my highschool cafeteria fries, which is not my preference. Gate 403 hit the nail right on the head with their fries, I will go back just for them.\n\nAnother solid entree is their penne pasta with red and green peppers, cherry tomatoes and baby kale in olive pesto sauce ($13). If you order this, do NOT forget to add the sausage (+$3), which is optional (but come on, it really isn't).\n\nI also quite enjoyed the Bruschetta with Feta cheese, vine tomatoes, roasted garlic & balsamic drizzle ($9). The bread was crispy and the topping was seasoned perfectly. It seemed to be a rather big portion of bruschetta though, it can definitely be shared. \n\nGate 403 also serves cocktails, martinis, sangrias and mangrias (the male version of sangria)! \n\nIf you're looking for parking, there is a greenP lot within walking distance nearby.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Vince BBQ & Chinese Food is a food court vendor that is operating in conjunction with their main restaurant , Vince Seafood and BBQ , which is located just steps away from the food court. Vince BBQ & Chinese Food is a great place for customers to have a quick , hot, fresh , and tasty meal that can be eaten at the food court or be available for take-out. Rather than having a sit down meal at the nearby restaurant, customers can expect to have quick and efficient meals in a matter of minutes. Vince does the classic stir fry dishes to perfection. They stick to the classics and customers will be able to enjoy these dishes for a good price. They have great combinations in terms of dinner where you can make a selection of how many dishes you would want. For example, you can select 3 items, which includes rice and soup,  from their special combo menu for $19.50 plus taxes. This is a great deal if you are feeling a bit off take out for an evening dinner. In terms of the fried noodles and rice, the prices are very reasonable , ranging from $5-$7, and you will not be disappointed, they are absolutely amazing.  The BBQ selection is astonishing, I have not had good Chinese BBQ for a long time, and if you want a taste of authentic Chinese BBQ, this is the place to go. If you can't decide what to order, I would recommend trying the Cantonese Chow Mein, Yeung Chow Fried Rice, Stir Fired Beef with Seasonal Vegetables, Salt and Pepper Pork Chop,  or their BBQ items with Noodles in Soup. I will defintely be coming to this food court vendor for a long time.

The red snapper fish was flavorless and there wasn't much BBQ meat to go around for four people. \n\nAs far as the food goes, I would have given this place four stars. However, I had to take away one star due to the service. The hostess was nice but the food came out really slow. There was seriously 15 minutes between each plate. Other tables were also complaining that the service was too slow and that they weren't receiving their food.

I noticed that 2 other tables around us also asked to follow up on their orders.\n\nTo be fair, both the hot pot and the eel dish were delicious without being oily at all.  The hot pot was of reasonable portion size, and the eel dish was a bit smaller than average, but this was well compensated by the deliciousness. \n\nI have always enjoyed the overall dining experience at Vince since it has opened.  I enjoy its dinner more than its dim sum.  I hope the kitchen has had an off night yesterday only.  I will surely return to dine again and update the rating.  I hope the experience will be better.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Just because it's a Thursday.\n\nSoooo in other words, prices here are crazy reasonable enough that you can come here on a random weekday and decide you feel like having all those awesome dishes you could only have once a year when you were a kid for the price of any regular Chinese dinner.\n\nWhy only the two-stars then? Service here is definitely hit or miss. One time I went and it was gold. I was ready to throw down 5 stars. The next time I came was for my mom's birthday dinner. That's a big deal. But everything went wrong that night. They messed up dishes, things came cold, some things came tasting off, they sat us in an area that was pretty much a freezer despite the fact the rest of the restaurant was fairly open.\n\nSo you'll have to take your chances with this place. if I go back one more time and the place is decent, I'll keep my star rating at 3.

They were open from 4 to 8pm and apparently Tuesday is pint night (discounted beers).  It was pretty easy to find, just look for all the cars!  I was doing this outing solo, so it was kind of nerve racking that there were so many people there, but I can't blame them....nice weather and good brews, I'd be there too if I lived in the area!  The inside is a big open room decorated in German beer hall style with picnic tables, and smaller tables for couples (or just me) with more seating outside.  I got a sampler platter of the 5 beers they had on tap.  Three ounce tastings of 5 beers for $3...not bad!  My favorite was the wheat, but they were all pretty good.  You can also buy growlers and have them refilled for a low cost, wish more bars would do this!  I checked out the menu, and reluctantly decided against the bratwurst panini....it looked good =)  \n\nThey are open most evenings with free tours on Saturdays.  While being in a crowded brew hall solo was a little weird, I'm glad I ventured out to taste some of the beers Charlotte has to offer.

Awesome.\n\nThe Pilsner we sampled Saturday was good, too - tart, a little floral - and they're supposedly releasing a Bock this week. Which is also awesome.\n\nAdditional awesomeness, and a reason to visit  - the space is open, airy, but comfy - high stools and tables, high backed booths, easy, friendly service. Despite being hidden in a somewhat industrialized area off of South blvd, I could hang here all day. Especially if they got some Veg Brauts out there on the cart.\n\nThe tour was rad because, well, hey, you're surrounded by a sea of delicious beer, but other than that - it was interesting to learn that OMB imports all their grain from Germany, meaning that what goes into the brew is high quality stuffs.

This is more akin to a winery, where you can see the inner workings - and even take a tour if you so choose - partaking of the product at the end.  Or even at the beginning, or skipping the tour entirely in favor of the suds.\n\nI get that the City of Charlotte has little in the way of country charm, or charm at all for that matter, having long ago forgone those details in the favor of building at all costs.  So the one downside is that the OMB is on a side road, in a very industrialized location that you are most assuredly not likely to find unless you really know where you are going, and even once you do, you probably will not be overwhelmed by the exterior of the building.

It doesn't look promising from the outside; less like a brewery and more like a meat packing plant where dreams go to die. I wasn't sure which door to go to, so I wrongly picked the one closest to my car. I found myself in a big empty space with what looked like some kind of class going on. Luckily, someone pointed me to the restaurant portion on the other side of the wall.\n\nAs much as this place is basically a warehouse, they do a good job on the interior. It is surprisingly welcoming with a ton of dark wood, long tables, German flags hanging from the rafters, and panels on the walls to deaden the noise. I've never been to Germany, but as far as German beer halls go, this one feels right.\n\nThe room is accentuated by two gigantic windows that gaze upon the brewing operation, which looks quite large from outside. It's probably the best option I've seen as far as giving visitors a glimpse of the brewing equipment without having it all up in their faces or in the way. And the restaurant didn't smell like brewery, so they must do a good job containing odors to the back.\n\nThe menu is a little limited; it features sausages imported from around the country and sides that can be prepared at the start of the day. I'm guessing they don't really have any cooking equipment in the back. I opted for two sausages - gyulai and knockwurst - and two sides. The sausages were excellent, and the sides were pretty on-point.\n\nFair warning - if you don't like vinegar, don't order the German sides.\n\nAs for the beer, it is clean and crisp and a damned good representation of the German style. If you don't like simple beers made with quality ingredients - if you must have 10 different malts and 60 plus IBUs - this is not your scene. There's beauty to be found in a well-done lager, though, as there's nothing to hide mistakes.\n\nEverything is tasty, but my favorites were the dopplebocks. Then again, that's my favorite style to begin with. And taking it to the next level, they had one of their higher ABV bocks available aged in bourbon barrels. Also my favorite. The beer could have used a little less time in the barrels, as I thought the bourbon stole the show instead of adding a layer of complexity, but it was still damn good.\n\nThe one negative comment I have is the service, and it wasn't the servers fault. Somebody must have called in sick, because on a Saturday near lunch time they only had two servers and a busser working the giant room. As such, I had to flag people down whenever I wanted something. But once I did, they were friendly and quick.\n\nOverall, I'd be back if I lived nearby, both for some sausage and some bock. Well done.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Service is present but could use some work - only after sitting with our beers for a good fifteen minutes did the bartender\/server? inform us that she'd forgotten to put in our order until just then. The brats were tasty, served with yummy German inspired sides on a paper plate with plastic cutlery. As a fairly young brewery it is understandable that the beer selection is focused on the two very drinkable standards, copper and mecklenburger, and the rotating seasonal, in winter a dunkel. After noshing we waited for the brewery tour (free on Saturdays!).

Still, none of it's current brews stick out much to me - as a Belgian style\/IPA fan, nothing was quite hoppy or spicy enough, although the dunkel has a satisfying roasted flavor.

We were not disappointed.\n\nHe had the OMB Copper and the Dunkel. I stuck with the Captain Jack (a pilsner) and had two of those. Really tasty and with a good sharp flavor. I could drink bunches of 'em. We sat inside so we could talk, but outside there was a live band. They also have food - sausages and other German haus food - but he wanted some of our great BBQ so after the brews, we headed elsewhere. Five beers for under $20 plus tip - a pretty good deal.\n\nFactoid: Captain James Jack was one of the signatories of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, which predates the US Declaration of Independence by a year. He was also one of the representatives from our area to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. What a journey that must have been - no airport, no highways.

So, according to them they don't like to put preservatives in their beer and that they go by that beer has an expiration date.

That cheese, that sauce, that garlic, that crunch. Oh. SO. GOOD.\n\nThen we carried on and had their meaty pizza (can't remember the name). It was friggin' amazing! The Italian beef was a really great touch that I didn't anticipate. The sausage had a delightful flavor and wasn't too fennel-y. The sauce is what landed the pizza in my dreams last night. It's a sweet sauce (which might be new to some). It's very close to some great St. Louis style pizzas I've eaten. The crust is crunchy and it's delivered brilliantly on a wire rack (to maintain the crunch). All I can say is: EAT HERE, thank me later.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

These changes ambush me without warning: not long ago I stopped putting Splenda in my tea - cold turkey. I started liking pastrami instead of corned beef. I stopped watching the news on TV. Is this a function of aging? I don't know.\n\nOne of the more dramatic changes has been my growing appreciation of the overall \"character\" of a restaurant. I find myself much more willing to overlook small gaffes in the food preparation if the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, or if the ambience is cheerful and interesting in some way. It doesn't have to be fancy - but it can't be gloomy and boring.\n\nThis was brought home to me today at lunch. Our friend Sue picked a place I had never been to - Spinato's Pizza. It's a family owned and run local chain with four locations. We went to the one at Bell and 16th Street. Sue brought along her friend\/employer Lee. It happens that Lee's grandson works in Spinato's kitchen. He always makes it a point to arrive 35 minutes before his shift begins so he can take advantage of employee dinner and he appreciates being treated like family. The place is cute - decorated in red, green and white. There are striped awnings above the booths, and trellises with vines. The chairs are white with green (or red) seats, and the table tops are white with the Spinato logo in the corners. The patio has tables with red-checked cloths. We were warmly greeted , and our server arrived promptly to offer drinks.\n\nKen and I ordered a large Spicy Italian pie ($19.50) with added ricotta. We also got a salad ($3.99). Lee requested garlic bread ($3.99, $4.79 with cheese), and a small spinach calzone, one of the house specialties ($9). Sue got spinach too, but in the form of a \"lil\" (smaller than small) pizza ($7.50). The salads arrived first, notable mostly for their large size. While the ingredients were fresh, there was nothing exciting there. The olive oil and balsamic vinegar served with them were of good quality. The garlic bread, eight pieces in the order, was outstanding - lots and lots of fresh garlic and a generous amount of butter. You have to make sure that everyone you'll be talking to in the next few hours has eaten some too. The staff checked in frequently to ask if we were happy. The pizzas were served on a wire rack, a great idea since the thin crust remains nice and crisp. Instead of slices, our pie was cut into many small squares. I found that for some reason this caused me to eat less. The pizza wasn't loaded down with sauce, and it had plenty of toppings. I tasted Sue's spinach pie and it was really good. The spinach is marinated before being put on the pizza, and there's tons of fresh garlic. Lee's calzone was quite large - he took half of it home.\n\nThe menu isn't extensive. Besides the pizzas (10 varieties, plus design your own)  and calzone (there's a spaghetti and meatball one) there are two pastas and five sandwiches. We didn't inquire about dessert. The story behind Spinato's is told on the back of the menu. The family was worried that when they left Chicago for Phoenix, back in the \"70's, they wouldn't be able to find good pizza. What choice did they have but to open their own pizza parlor?! As the family grew so did the number of parlors. While the prices aren't low, you can go to lunchclub.com and get a 25% off the entire bill coupon. Aren't coupons great!!\n\nI have to say that if I was doing a blind taste-test between Stumpy's pizza (see the archives) and Spinato's, I'd probably give the nod to Stumpy's. But if you add in those other factors which have become important to me, as a dining destination Spinato's wins. It's also won awards from Phoenix New Times, the Scottsdale Culinary Festival and City Search.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

The catch, I have to meet them in a 1\/2 hour coming from Scottsdale. \n\nNormally this wouldn't be a big issue, but I took lounging to a whole new level on Sunday, and I was looking pretty bedraggled. I quickly looked up Spinato's on Yelp, since my parents have been known to be hit or miss on some eateries. All great reviews, which made me really want to try it. \n\nThe lure of a free dinner, (and seeing my mom) put my unshowered butt in gear! So I hopped in the car 15 minutes later looking slightly scary. Unfortunately, I couldn't wear a hat inside the restaurant, or I would have. \n\nTurns out it didn't really matter what I looked like anyway. At 5 PM on Sunday the crowd was right out of Cocoon, before they got in that pool! One lady even had her oxygen tank with her. I found myself wishing I could try it. I kept wondering if I breathed in that oxygen for a while, would I get some kind of wonderful, natural high???\n\nThe place was packed, and it turns out those geriatrics really know their stuff. The food was great!\n\nWe did the whole dinner family style. The antipasto salad with spinach was amazingly perfect, really the best I've ever had.  The garlic bread was deliciously, warm, garlicky, and crunchy all at once. The marinara sauce to dip it is was slightly sweet, but not in an obnoxious way. It was just the right counter balance to the garlic.\n\nThe pizza itself was decent, not great, but decent. This is probably because I prefer thinner crust, and minimal cheese on the pizza, such as Grimaldi's, but that didn't keep me from eating it. It didn't keep me from having it for lunch the next day either! \n\nI will definitely be back for the antipasto salad with spinach & the garlic bread. I need to cut back on the pizza anyway. Oh, and the service was amazing. I don't even think we had one wait person. Anybody you asked for something immediately brought it to you! Seriously, nothing phased them. Love it, and hopefully I'll be back soon!","useful":17,"funny":21,"cool":16}

After buying one of those playing card decks with restaurant discounts, we finally tried Spinato's (after living in Phoenix since 2003). Yes, I fully realize how ridiculous it is that I hadn't been here sooner. \n\nThere are so many great things about this restaurant ranging from the service, food, deals (coupon and daily deals), and conveniences (order ahead while waiting for a table). From the time we sat down (both visits), the service was top-notch and friendly. \n\nFirst visit, we had the specialty spinach pizza with plenty of garlic and tomatoes ($15 for a medium). It was delicious but way too much pizza for us 4 when we paired it when their large order of ravioli and two meatball. That was so good too! Oh did I forget to mention the garlic cheese bread that we ordered with the baked bread and butter. Both, simply amazing. Clearly I was aiming for the food going straight towards my waistline. I also had a glass of wine since they are half off on Sundays and made sure to get some of their chocolate chip cookies to go. \n\nFor the second visit (a week later), we dialed it back a bit. Of course we had to have the garlic cheese bread, kids ravioli ($5 for the ravioli, a breadstick, drink, and scoop of gelato), small specialty pizza ($10 and plenty for my husband and son to share) and I had the \"lil\" spinach calzone (7\" for $5). That calzone was so delicious, I couldn't save the half I set aside for lunch. Add two glasses of wine (half off), and two piccola brownie desserts, and our total bill was $45. For a family of four with drinks, an appetizer and 2 desserts???? Pretty damn reasonable in this day in age. And it has been a long time since I was that blissfully satisfied with a meal (or two).

My husband could\/would eat pizza everyday of his life if I permitted. When we went back to visit his parents he actually took me on a pizza tour of the area all of which ended with his absolute favorite pizza, Aurelio's. His love for this pizza stems from childhood and I honestly do not think you could convince him that there is a greater pizza out there. I even once looked into shipping Aurelio's for a birthday present and quickly realized that that was insanely expensive. \n\nFast forward to this summer when I discovered a review on Yelp that mentioned that there used to be an Aurelio's here in AZ that eventually became Spinato's. Well my husband insisted that we get in the car that moment and check it out. The sweet marinara is exactly what he was looking for and while not exactly the same this is the closest pizza in Arizona to his beloved favorite. The crust is thin and the sausage is hand crumbled (or appears to be). They are very generous on the cheese and toppings in general and leftovers the next day aren't too shabby.

The week-long journey in paradise will renew one from the inside and out, mentally and physically. The yoga, accommodations, and cuisine are top-notch and the epitome of a five star resort.\n\nThere isn't a better way to start each day than a morning yoga class in a heated room, on a hillside with a panoramic view of the ocean on the Bay of Tenacatita. The room is heated perfectly to 105 degrees and 40 percent humidity. The yoga is comprised of 26 poses with two breathing exercises. It's suitable for beginners to advanced practitioners. Bruce is an amazing teacher as he is attentive to each guest, providing ongoing suggestions for improvement and positive feedback. You do a second class the same day in the afternoon. Doing two classes a day was quite challenging the first few days, but you'll get accustomed to it mid-week. I've seen immense further depth in my postures in a week of practicing with Bruce.\n\nPunta Serena is the resort where the retreat is held at. The ocean-side villas have spectacular views and you'll fall asleep each night with the sound of waves crashing in your front yard. The villas are clean with the grounds well-kept. There's plenty of fresh towels and spa-like amenities in the bathrooms. There's a private beach just steps down from the villas, an infinity pool (perfect for taking a dip in after each class), and two jacuzzis perched overlooking the Bay. And you get one free thirty minute massage during the week's stay.\n\nThe food served at the on-site restaurant is a highlight of the retreat. You'll have access to The Buena Vista restaurant for breakfast, lunch, afternoon snacks, and dinner. All meals are included with unlimited access to the open bar after 6pm. Bruce coordinates with the staff of the restaurant to provide a variety of juices and smoothies, along with 3-4 different types of salads with each meal for the retreat attendees to nosh on before ordering an entree. One surely gets pampered and fueled with the freshest greens, seafood, and meats. There wasn't a single meal I had which I wasn't satisfied with.\n\nI'd definitely return for another week at Hot Yoga Bliss Vacations. It's the most rewarding treat one can give themselves. My mind and body are still thanking me for it.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I've recently returned from an April 2015 retreat, feel amazing and am looking at my schedule to see when I can go back.  \n\nThe Yoga:\n\nThe teaching was top notch, Bruce and Carrie were great and took my practice to the next level. I've been practicing regularly (3-6x week) for 6 years and I still learned a lot. Ongoing injuries improved more dramatically over 1 week than over years of yoga and 6 months of physical therapy. The room was perfect as far as heat & humidity and it was fantastic to practice with stunning views of the ocean. I wasn't trying to lose weight, ate 3 meals\/ day (including a ton of guacamole which was very good at the resort!) and lost 5 lbs. \n\nThe Resort:\n\nPacific Coast Rustic Mexican Chic. The staff was warm and eager to please whether it was re-opening the office to get bug spray at 10PM or making special requests for food. You are given particularly special treatment being part of \"El Grupo de Bruce.\" I have Celiac and the manager of the resort sat down with me to go over the menu and see if there was anything that I needed not on the menu or outside of the resort. \n\nThe Spa:\n\nThe massages were amazing and incredibly reasonable, everyone on our group got more than 1. I highly recommend Rodrigo!  \n\nThe Price:\n\nThe resort is truly all inclusive and an amazing value for the price. I barely used my wallet all week. I wouldn't call this a 5 star resort by US or continental standards but you definitely aren't paying for this either. You're getting 8 days of great yoga with star instructors, solid lodging and food in a beautiful setting for the price of ~3 nights at a boutique hotel. The resort is clean, beautiful and aesthetically pleasing. \n\nI recommend checking out trip advisor reviews on the resort (it gets a high rating) ... The linens\/ towels\/ mattresses\/ etc are not posh and you won't mistake it for the 4 Seasons (although the staff is as warm and as eager to please).\n\nRecommendations:\n\nEat lots of guacamole- it is amazing!\nBring strong bug spray\nIf you get sick, see the resort doctor. I admittedly get sick often when traveling to certain parts of the world and go with travel antibiotics. I was the only one from our group to get sick and after an uncomfortable night\/ morning when the travel antibiotics weren't cutting it, the resort doctor gave me a shot that had me feeling better in 1 hour and back at the evening yoga class and dinner.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

In addition to an amazing view of the ocean, there was always fresh fruit and juice waiting for us after class.

They do use wine to cook but if you mention that you eat halal, they can make substations for you.\n\nNow, I came here with old colleagues for summerlicious and to catch up. We made reservations for 6pm. When we arrived, one of party was running late. But the server kept coming around to refill glasses and check up on us. When everyone was here, however, they tried to rush us into ordering a little. Eventually they stopped, to the point that we had to then call them over when we were all ready to order.\n\nThe excellent part is a lot of us were torn on what we wanted. They were really nice and offered us to somewhat combine dishes. They usually offer a substitution for the steak, instead of mashed potatoes and veggies you can get pasta. But the pasta is usually like penne. Thy graciously allowed us to have lobster ravioli as out pasta side. Two pieces of ravioli (the actually dish has 6 pieces) with our steak. We even got complimentary veggies to share amongst the four of us.\n\nThe downside to this great offer was that I ordered a medium steak and got something closer to medium-well. And the lobster ravioli wasn't that great. Although the sauce was amazing.\nFor our apps we had gotten calamari, meatballs and crab cake. The crab cake was a bit lonely, just one cake. The meatballs were good. But tiny and only four. The calamari was delicious!\nThe most pathetic part of our meal was the dessert. When put together it was pretty yummy, esp the ricotta gelato. The brownie was okay and the poached pear looked like tuna sashimi on the plate. It was yummy but two pieces of it was too much for the tiny dollop of gelato. I wish they hadn't presented it deconstructed on such a large plate.\n\nSo the food was hit and miss. My negative comments relate to the service. We were very pleased with the service until we finished dinner and dessert and no one came around for ages. Then they went to get four bills and did come back for another 15 mins. In the meantime I had to use the washroom. When I saw there was no toilet paper, I went back to notify one of the employees there. She said okay, but did not go to replace the roll. I had to borrow wet wipes from a friend to use their washroom ...... That is not good service. ESP in a restaurant. That isn't bustling with diners. Lastly, I paid in cash and it took another 15 mins before my change came around and we could finally leave.\n\nThis seems like a nice place, but it also seems like they won't be open for long. The food was okay, the service averages to okay. They weren't busy. I won't be going back. It's harsh to say it, but it definitely doesn't look like a business that will last.","useful":2,"funny":3,"cool":0}

When the shop used to be across the road, before the condo was built there, the service was very personal and helpful.  Now everything about the store including the staff remarks and the prices is a bit on snobby side and if you are looking for a pet which is not a dog or a cat, then the clerk will wriggle up her nose in disgust.  I asked where I could find Mouse food and she directed me to the back wall where there was none.  When I asked at the desk a SECOND time, after waiting in line this time, she said we don't carry it LOL.  Well that was a wasted free steps except I did look at the treats and I found a few made in Canada which is good so they got my money.  They made no effort to order the food for me even though they clearly order from Oxbow for other creatures.  I then called Global down the road a couple of blocks and they didn't have it either but she immediately offered to order it for me.  I even told the Pet Valu clerk that I was disappointed she didn't order it for me but she is the expert in teflon remarks.  They also carry mouse treats made in China which for anything that an animal will ingest is very disappointing.  When I mentioned this to the clerk I got this teflon remark \"well we can't have everything made in CAnada\".  I have shopped here since we first got our first pet (dog) in 2006 and I can honestly say I don't like this location any longer.  The one mouse wheel we purchased was broken and we had no problems with the products purchased at Pet Smart but the Pet Smart is an american store and it's quite a bit further away.  Still at least they have stock and they show gratitude.  I would have thought for the money I did spend today I would have at least heard the word thank you.

The staff is always friendly and helpful when I'm shopping, and the few times I've brought my Flemish Giant bunny in, they absolutely adore her!\n\nOne of my favourite things about this location is that they sell TWO brands of Ontario-grown hay, something I am quickly learning as a rabbit owner is harder to find than you'd think. They carry both the Dunlea Farms hay in a tidy feeder, and my new favourite brand, Knee-Deep Farms hay. The latter is especially a great bargain at $7 for a huge bag, and my bunny ADORES it, her favourite hay by far. \n\nThe only thing loosing one star for me is that they have a very limited selection of small animal products. I definitely always come here for my bunny's food, litter, and hay, but seek other stores out for her toys and accessories, as they really don't have much.

I had no idea there was even a restaurant in this area being that it's in a small strip mall but it takes up most of the space, about half it seems.  The inside of this restaurant is really visually striking.  The red and black theme is throughout the interior from the signs, walls, and tables.  \n\nThe menu has a mixed of antipasto, salads, pasta, meats, fish, risotto and pizzas.  It's a decent mix of dishes and choices.  I ended up getting the quattro stagione and my wife had ordered the white potato pizza.  The quattro stagione literally translated means four seasons.  I'm used to seeing this pizza's ingredients on each of the 4 quarters pizzas like quadrants.  I didn't get it that way for some reason.  All the ingredients (mushrooms, prosciutto, olives and artichokes) were evenly spread across the pizza.  It was still decent but just not what I was expecting to see.\n\nMy wife ate about half of her potato pizza.  Typically if we go to a place that serves pizza she'll always go with a white pizza (no red sauce) if it's an option and she likes potato pizza in general where ever she can find it.  She only ate half of it as she usually does but she said it was too greasy.  I was too full to have any of her pizza since I ate all of mine at the restaurant.  The potato pizza came with onions and pancetta.  I'm used to pancetta being thicker and more fatty like bacon.  Honestly this pancetta looked like deli sliced cooked ham.\n\nWe took home the left overs and I ended up eating them that night.  I have to say the potato pizza was very greasy I have to agree with my wife.  The bottom crust was in fact saturated and it wasn't pretty.\n\nOverall the pizzas weren't out of this world and I can safely say that in the GTA we've had much better than this.  It seemed that the toppings weren't very generous or distributed properly.  I mean the quattro stagione is not even in quarters.  Don't get me wrong I've had Neapolitan style pizza before so I know what to sort of expect and mind you this place although not VPN certified like Libretto or Pizza e Pazzi doesn't have to be like many other places out there but I simply found this pizza to be not as good all around.  \n\nWhether it's the thickness of the crust or the ingredients simply put it's not as good as some of the other non-VPN Neapolitan type style pizza out there in the GTA (850 Degrees, Napoli Centrale).  It is IMO a notch lower than Grazie.\n\nI can't speak to the rest of the menu but as far as the pizza for me, this is not a go to place.  The service was attentive and friendly.","useful":5,"funny":4,"cool":6}

You really can't go wrong with cured meats, and you get tons of it for $18! My friend ordered the caprese Di bufala which was kinda disappointing. The tomatoes weren't quite ripe enough and the bufala wasn't as creamy or flavourful as one would like. I ordered one of the meat specials (Tagliata di manzo with truffled salad for $32) - which was essentially a carved steak with an arugula salad. I love arugula salad, but I must admit I was a little disappointed that it didn't come as a fancy schmancy salad as the name suggested. The steak was a bit veiny but probably my fault for ordering a not so great cut of meat rare. My friend ordered the salmon special which looked fantastic. I didn't try the fish, but I did steal a brussel sprout and it was pretty good (and I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts at all!). Ended the meal with a latte (very unremarkable) and the tiramisu.

Don't try to change the restaurant; it was successful before for a reason!!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Needless to say, since my initial visit I have yet to go back.\nThe place has a youthful, high energy vibe about ........one would hope the food and the service would live up to the hype.\nWe arrived without a reservation so we had to wait for a table to become available. Certainly not the restaurants fault. We perused the menu while waiting and the wait was only approx. 10 minutes.\nThe smells in the restaurant were intoxicating.....so by the time our waiter came by for a drink order, we were ready to order our food. Waiters attitude was off-putting, as though he was doing us the favour by  allowing himself to be our server. We ordered and off he went.......never came back to check on us. He did stop by a table near to us as he had friends in dining that night and actually sat with them for a few minutes chatting.....all while we had empty drink glasses in front of us. We had to flag him down on one of his many trips past us for a drink refill order.\n\nFood arrived after a substantial wait (it was very busy so one must expect the kitchen to be overwhelmed) but it was unmemorable. Two of us had ordered pizza...and both agreed we've had much better elsewhere. The other members of our party were equally unimpressed with their food.\n\nObviously this restaurant is going for a younger crowd than us (lol) but the noise, combined with average food flavour, warrants this rating.\n\nWe have not gone back","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The first part of our night went well...the place was not busy at all so we were quickly seated, good vibe, trendy decor, youthful and family-friendly. Our waiter started out great - very personable tho the poor guy had to spend almost 5 minutes on his spiel about the 12+ items on Special. He provided some good recommendations on apps and mains. The octopus salad was a great kick-start to the night. This was followed by an avocado and burrato stromboli which was over a foot-long and very filling (they messed up this order by putting ham in it but we took it because it looked yummy). We only had a small piece each in order to save room for the mains. Well that wasnt necessary since we hardly touched the mains - the papardelle was over-cooked and sticking together and the fennel salad was very over-dressed. The biggest dissapointment were the fridge-temperature meatballs - not room temperature, but they were actually cold inside. We couldnt find out waiter for a while and twice had to ask different staff to retrieve him. The hostess\/manager was good about taking care of these items on the bill and providing complementary dessert.

I am a big teppanyaki fan and have been to many other teppanyaki restaurants outside and inside of Toronto. Yet it was not only the worst Teppanyaki experience I have ever had, but also one of the worst restaurant experiences overall..\n\nIt's been few weeks since I had my first (and hopefully the last) visit to Hibachi. Two of my girlfriends and I came in right on time for our reservation. The hostess approached us then said our table was not ready. It was understandable at first since it was a busy friday night. She had us seated at the bar and we ordered a cocktail each just to kill some time. Everything was great until then. The cocktails were tasty and we were all in a good mood. We didn't know it'd take more than 40 mins for them to actually \"get our table ready\". We finished our drinks after 20 mins and very kindly asked the hostess when our table will be ready. She said she will figure it out for us then left us for another good 20mins without giving us any heads up. After some time, FINALLY the other hostess (different one from the one who sat us at the bar) told us the table is ready and we HAVE TO settle our bills before we leave the bar. So we settled our bills. \n\nWe were seated at the table and not after so long, the server approached us. We already knew what we wanted and ordered. He said we have to wait for the table to be filled. So we waited.. again. Skipping to the conclusion, the whole process of waiting for the other customers to arrive, to order food, and to actually have the chef show up to the table took ANOTHER 35 mins. We were starving. \n\nThe show began and it was just mediocre. Same old onion volcanoes and some other basic tricks that you see at other teppanyaki restaurants. For food, we ordered a green dragon roll to share as an appetizer, then fillet mignon for myself and two other things from their teppanyaki main menu for my friends. The green dragon roll, I still remember just because of the poorly cut avocados on top of the roll. Wanted my fillet mignon to be cooked rare and turned out to be cooked medium. My friends and I were actually too tired out to make complaints by the time we were served. The food, to be honest, was not the worst but not the best either. \n\nIn total, it took hibachi 75MINS to put just any food into our mouths. I understand how the teppanyaki restaurants work.. but this was just overwhelming.\n\nAnd yet, the best part hasn't come out. We were just about half way done eating when we heard something unexpected. Apparently, who seemed to be like the manager or the supervisor was YELLING at one of his staffs in front of all the  customers. It was really REALLY uncomfortable to witness the whole yelling, shouting, and swearing while eating. Yes, swearing. We didn't finish our food. We just asked for the bill, paid, then came out.\n \nThe staffs were nice and friendly, but that is actually the only nice thing I could say about this place. If anyone wants to try teppanyaki, just go somewhere else. It's just not worth it to spend the amount of time and the money for such place.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

So on my husband's birthday I decided to make reservations.\n\nWe ended up going with the prix fixe menu, with some upgrades. This  includes soup, salad, fried rice, sushi rolls, ice cream on top of the grilled meats and veggies. The fare was pretty standard for a hibachi grill, steak, chicken, scallops and shrimp. They did add lobster to the mix, which was nice touch. The scoops of ice cream were nice-sized, which is good cause my hubs loves ice cream.\n\nThe most entertaining part of course were the antics of the chef juggling his tools and setting food on fire. (See the two videos I posted.) I had previously asked to add on a birthday package, but as the evening drew to a close I saw no sign of it. Even my mother-in-law commented that a candle and cake would have been nice. A couple of gentle reminders later, the wait staff did serenade my husband with drums, a chef hat and really nice green tea cheesecake (yes, with a candle ) They even gave us a framed photo, which was a nice memento of the evening.\n\nThe only down side was that although mostly courteous, there is a little bit of a language barrier with some of the wait staff. This was a bit unexpected given the venue. None-the-less, it was a really fun evening.\n\nMy Rating: 3.5\/10. 1.5 points deducted because food although good, was pretty standard, no delectable surprises. 1 point deducted for wait staff forgetting the birthday package and potentially embarrassing me in front of my in laws.\n\nPro Tip: When you make the reservations, ask to purchase coupons at the door. You get a 2 for 1 deal on the prix fixe menu, which works really well with the wallet.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Our server was exceptionally friendly, and good with customers overall. I had just wished the chef would have been more enthusiastic. There may have only been 4 people at our table, but the show just seemed a little lacklustre. The egg toss and fire volcano were nice, but the performance just felt very \"let's get this over with\".\n\nAside from the service, I have to say the food was a bit of a letdown. We used a Groupon that listed a $140 face value for 2 people, which is a HUGE inflation.The food was just average.\n\nSad to say that I've had better miso soup and Japanese salad at AYCE restaurants.\n\nThe chef's choice roll was pretty decent. I'm not sure if it was chicken or shrimp tempura, but the roll tasted okay.\n\nThe teppanyaki I must say provided a substantial amount of food with LOTS of variety. Lobster, shrimp, scallops, chicken and steak cooked the way you want it. They give you dark and light sauces to dip in. The dark tastes like typical steak sauce, and the light tastes like a thousand island mayonnaise variation. Without the sauce the food is rather bland. While it has a nice charred flavour to it, a little salt or seasoning would have been nice.\n\nThe green tea ice cream was much creamier than I expected. To be honest, if I closed my eyes, I probably would have thought it was vanilla.\n\nOverall a 3.5 star experience. Food was okay, show was okay, service was exceptional! After tax and tip, it wasn't too far from the face value. I don't know where $140 came from, but I really wouldn't have been able to justify that price.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I wouldn't say that it was really busy in the restaurant - perhaps 5 other tables at the time.

This was a bit let down that it ruined the whole night. \n\nThat being said - I had spoke to the manager over a period of weeks who promised to replace the umbrella and offered to have me back to dine again. 2 months after my first visit I returned with my boyfriend. And it is safe to say they absolutely redeemed themselves. The manager - Joey was very friendly and checked up on us to make sure our experience was good. We were even served by the same waiter who we had the first time. He was very professional, polite and apologized for our previous experience. The food itself was great! I had the Fillet mignon, lobster & scallops which was all cooked perfectly! The chef was quiet but did an excellent job of making sure we were well entertained.

The experience was great. Our chef's name was Justin. I really enjoyed the part where he lit the onion on fire. He also tried to threw little pieces of broccoli into our mouths with his spatula. He succeeded the first two times and then it didn't go so well for the rest of us but it was a good laugh. The food was actually really bland. The teriyaki sauce they used is extremely light and the dipping sauces they provided, which were a mayo-based and a ginger\/soy sauce based,were also a bit plain. And I'm not a person that usually eat salty stuff. Portion is plenty though. Also, expect the steak to be over cooked because they were chopped into small pieces.\n\nThe Groupon was $75 for two plus tax and 15% service charge already added which ended up being $97.46. I don't think it was a good deal because I think the deluxe combo which is $42 per person is somewhat similar but comes with filet mignon and salmon if I remember correctly. Groupon claims that this deal is originally $150 in value is very much an exaggerated overstatement. Overall was a good experience but I don't think it's worth a second visit.

We then got a vegetable sushi roll which was so yummy, definitely one of the best rolls I've had and I wanted more. Next, the teppanyaki chef came and prepared our entrees! It was quite a fun show to watch especially the onion trick. He grilled some vegetables and vegetarian fried rice as our next meal. The vegetarian rice was ok, a bit too buttery tasting imo. The vegetables were yummy! For our main meal we had strip loin steak, lobster tail, chicken filet, shrimp, and Atlantic scallops. Yes, the groupon comes with all of these meats but not a full portion of each meat. It is extremely filling! I thought our steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and the shrimp was wonderfully juicy. I could have cared less for the chicken and scallops though. Then finally, to finish it off we got a scoop of ice cream!\n\nOverall, my bf and I had a great time and really enjoyed our food and the entertainment.

The crust is really thin, airy and light, but not hard, crunchy or crispy like you might expect a thin crust to be.\n\nWe had the Diavola pizza which had crushed tomatoes, garlic, basil, bell peppers, peppered salami, crushed red peppers, etc. So incredibly flavorful and delicious. What's really amazing is that you taste every single topping. It's like hearing an orchestra where you can isolate and identify every single instrument yet still appreciate the cohesive whole that they become. \n\nWe also had the warm beets (served simmering in a cast iron pot smothered in garlic, oil and Marcona almonds) and the Insalata, both of which were delicious. \n\nFor the drink we shared the Triple B. Bourbon, Balsamic Reduction, muddled strawberries, lemon juice, and a few other ingredients that I can't quite recall. My wife said it reminded her of a scented candle... Not sure I agree but we both thought it was great! \n\nThe atmosphere is also nice. Comfortable, cozy, warm and inviting with a nice energy. This is definitely a place that we'll come back to.\n\nUPDATE: We've been back 3 more times now and we've never gotten the same dish twice, we always try something new.

The chairs and tables are warm dark wood and leather, as are the booths. Nice high ceilings and a beautiful large bar area, segmented off from the main restaurant.\n\nThat's where the niceness ends unfortunately. I'm not sure if this is a family owned business, but the service was neither prompt nor overly friendly. We came in the middle of the afternoon with only two other customers in the place. The host seemed like he was just wandering aimlessly around the dining area and just happened to see us. The booths are not exactly comfortable, as I think the backs are a bit too tight and push you forward to the table.\n\nQuick summation of the meal:\n\nArugula salad (Panzanella): probably the best thing we had. Homemade croutons and little dried pieces of proscuttio topped with large shavings of parmigiano.\n\nMeatball appetizer: five small meatballs in so-so tomato sauce and topped with basil slivers. Meatballs were cold (as in freezer cold) in the middle and not especially tasty. You can see that the cheese on top is not even slightly melted, which is rather indicative of the overall temperature of the dish.\n\nSalsiccia e Friarielli (sausage and broccoli) pizza. Sausage was not bad at all, but appeared to be tossed on the pizza in very uneven clumps. The dough was also not bad, but the chef definitely needs more experience with his or her oven. Burnt on the outside, raw on the inside. This can happen now and then with a good hot pizza oven, but added to everything else it just added insult to injury.\n\nSo, salad, pizza, appetizer. $50.00 for lunch. Not a great first experience in the Village Square on Sahara.

Very similar to the way that the wait staff is. Very unimpressed with their staff. Never asked how the meal was because then we could have told them that it was quite cold where we were sitting. The table although nice for atmosphere, is very unsanitary since it's unfinished wood. My friend when she was dishing up ur own salad dropped several pieces of salad as well as pine nuts etc and they just settle into the nooks and crannies of this table. I will say that they do give you a lot of whatever toppings are listed for that pizza, are on that pizza. We had the settebello pizza and it did have plenty of sausage and mushrooms and pine nuts on it however not too much cheese. But all in all it did come with the variety of toppings that was stated on the menu. I'm glad I was warned about the pie being wet, that is not my preferred style however this was the style and it was something that I was aware of. All in all a so-so experience","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This was very sweet with all the caramel combined together but very tasty!  Just beware if you aren't a fan of overly sweet desserts.\n\nS'mores Calzone ($7): Filled with Chocolate, Marshmallow & Powdered Sugar. Very sweet...super chocolaty.

They have two times 3-6 and 830-close. \n\nThe table ordered Moscow mules ($5), arancini ($5), Diavola pizzette ($5), Vico pizzette ($5), and a Emilia pizzette ($5). This was a great way to try out the different pizzas they had to offer. \n\nThere were two arancini that came with the order. The crust was delightfully crunchy and crisp which complimented the fluffy filling and tangy marinara sauce. (4\/5)\n\nThe diavola pizzette was topped with crushed tomatoes, peppered salame, roasted red bell pepper, crush red pepper, garlic, mozz, and some evoo. Unfortunately with the amount of toppings, the dough of the pizza soaked it all in and became a mush when I bit into the slice. It was more of a salad with a charred crust. (2\/5)\n\nMy favorite from the pizzette as was the Vico. Toppings on the Vico included sausage, red onion, mascarpone, basil, mozz, evoo, and roasted fennel. The pizza managed to stay in one piece when picked up unlike the diavola. The texture was awesome with the creaminess of the mascarpone mixed with the succulent sausage and the crunch of the roasted fennel. I would come back for this pizza! (4.5\/5)\n\nLastly, the Emilia pizzette had prosciutto cotto, Italian cream, mozz, evoo, parmigiana reggiona, and corn. This was a very savory and creamy pizza. It lacked acids to balance the flavor and had me taking sips of the Moscow mule to cut the richness. (3\/5) \n\nAlthough I can't say this place is my definite go to for pizza in the neighborhood, their Vico pizza will have me coming back...for happy hour!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We spotted this place and thought we'd give it a try. \n\nThe wood-burning oven and wood pile in the dining room gives the whole place a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Our server, Bethany, gave us a nice overview of the menu and explained their style of pizza - Napoleon - and also briefed us on the Happy Hour specials. \n\nWe were pleased that they had $5 mini-pizzas on the Happy Hour menu since we saw several pizzas (all 12 inches only) on the regular menu that we would like to try. I opted for the Diavola and Hubby got the Emilia with red sauce instead of white. We also ordered a couple of drinks but nothing special. They did seem to have a nice selection of wines and beers and we will definitely explore this next visit when we have more time.\n\nThe pizzas arrived timely and looked delicious. Like another reviewer stated, the thin crust is crisp on the outside edges but soft in the middle. It almost seems to form a \"bowl\" as it bakes which causes this. I personally found it to be fine. What I was disappointed with was the taste. Everything was fresh but bland. I had to add salt (which I NEVER do, especially to pizza!) and red pepper flakes to give it flavor. There was certainly nothing \"Devilish\" about the Diavola!! Hubby enjoyed the Emilia and said next time that he would like to try the Settebello. \n\nWe will come back when we have more time and try some different menu items for sure!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I had the opportunity to have a meal with some fabulous fellow Yelpers last week and we had a five star meal, as expected. Since we had a larger party, we were able to order and share quite a few different pizzas and desserts. \n\nWe started with Arancini for our appetizer, which was good and opted for five different pizzas, the Margherita DOC, Settebello, Carbonara, Diavola and the special of the day which was a white pizza. My favorites were the Margherita, Settebello and Diavola, although all of them were great. The Diavola had a fantastic spiciness that I couldn't get enough of. The Margherita was simple, but perfectly made and showcased the quality ingredients that they use. The Settebello is the restaurant's namesake and has the perfect combination of flavors, and I can never say no to a pine nut. My least favorite was probably the white pizza, since it had quite a few more onions than I would have liked. It was lacking for me, but my tablemates seemed to love it quite a bit They do have weekly specials, so it's a good idea to check them out on Facebook or sign up online for their newsletter for updates. \n\nLuckily, we were able to sample quite a few desserts as well while we were there. The Caramel Budino stole my heart the moment I read the description on the menu and it did not disappoint. This was one of the highlights of our meal for me. Flavorful and a great combination of flavors. The dessert pizza was heaven. Cinnamon, apples, caramel, powdered sugar served on their beautiful pizza dough. This was a great dessert as well. My second favorite of the day. The S'mores Calzone and Zeppoles didn't do much for me. They were good, but too sweet and chocolatey for my taste. That's probably just me, though. \n\nAs a fan of Settebello for so long, this meal lived up to all my fond memories of meals with friends at the Settebello in Henderson and makes me wonder why it took me so long between visits.","useful":6,"funny":4,"cool":5}

We stood there for a few minutes before a server acknowledged us and yelled to a girl standing by the pizza oven chatting to the cook. That's when I realized she was suppose to be the hostess, but she obviously thought talking to the cook was more important. Moments before, a large group had entered the restaurant and stood behind us, and the hostess ignored me and my friend and immediately spoke to the guy behind me and asked if they had a reservation. Perhaps she thought we were all one party, but I thought that was pretty rude of her not to ask. \n\nWhen we were finally seated, we were unable to get menus right away because they had run out.

We were a group of 12 women but we came in groups of four with 20 minute increments in between our arrivals. \nWe ordered a few personal pizzas, an artichoke crostini and a couple craft cocktails including a mint Collins, basil gimlet and Moscow mule that were each $5. They have a wide variety on their happy hour menu with lots of different choices. \n\nEverything we drank and ate was awesome. The char on the pizza crust that they get from the wood fired oven was perfect. Chewy texture with a little crunch on their crust. The artichoke crostini had slices of prosciutto, large pieces of marinated artichoke and and ricotta. You can't beat the price on the craft cocktails either! \n\nService was incredibly slow, the waitress was overwhelmed when our group came in and never wrote anything down. She would then come back and ask what we ordered every time she took an order. At one point two girls spoke up and she snapped back, you both can't talk to me I can only handle one person at a time. She clearly needed help but no one else came to assist her. Next time write things down. One of my friends waited 20 minutes for a water!

Well how bout I start with I got what I expected. Meaning after reading numerous Yelp reviews about how the pizza is either a hit or a miss because of the wet or uncooked pizza dough. I could see why some people wouldn't care for it. For me I knew it was going to be like that so I guess I wasn't as disappoint as oppose to someone who wasn't expecting soggy center. \n\nI came right when they open first customer of the day. The restaurant itself is super cool, very rustic and stylish. Classy with lots and lots of space. The bar to the left is a great size with flat screen TVs. The kitchen is sort of open with an awesome oven for pizza prepping. I also notice a nice size private dinning room which can be closed off to the rest of the Resturant. \n\nWe were greeted nicely and seated promptly. I started off with the Insalata Grande which was dresses lightly but perfectly with a balsamic vinaigrette. The fresh mixed greens with baby arugula was simply topped with their amazing roasted or more like sautéed mushrooms, delicious salty olives, tomatoes, shaved parmigiana and the best chunks of juicy tender artichoke hearts. But the best part of it was the pine nuts. It gave the salad the crunch it needed. \n\nWife and I shared the Signature Settebello pizza. Waitress kindly described their pizza as being thin crust with chard crust and \"chewy\" dough meaning it's completely wet in the middle where you can't even pick it up even if you had skills. The pizza came out pretty quick and had lots of flavor the sausage was amazing the chard crust was something I really dig but yes the center was  soggy. There has to be a way for them to make their yummy pizza with a more cooked and not so wet center. You almost have to use a fork to eat it properly without a fork just forget about trying to pick it up. \n\nOther then that I really did like what I had, priced fairly but I wasn't blown away to where I will come running back. Very nice Resturant and will return just not any time soon.","useful":4,"funny":3,"cool":3}

Perfect for sharing between two people or feeding a very hungry individual. The Pizza Napoletana dough is softer than your average pizza and is meant to be eaten with a knife and fork. The pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven and I would liken it to a thicker version of Indian naan bread. Wonderful texture, in my opinion.

There was one item that I had every intention of ordering and it wasn't there. That item was a budino, an Italian pudding-like dessert. It's simple, but when done right it'll make you wonder why you haven't had it sooner.\n\nOf course, Settebello is know for their pizza rather than desserts so I had to try one. I opted for the self-titled pie the Settebello ($13.50) with crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and evoo. The interplay of savoriness and saltiness made for excellent flavors and the pine nuts added a crunchy texture that elevated the rest of the dish. My biggest complaint was the paper thin crust under the pie. I understand the Napoli-style makes for a wet pizza with a soft, pliable crust, but the lack of density beneath all the ingredients made it appear soupy. A good pizza for sure, but my personal preference is for a firmer crust.\n\nWithout the budino, I decided to try two desserts. First up was the Dream Bomba ($5), a dense ball of caramel surrounded by a creamy and smooth peanut butter gelato and coated in chocolate. It was cut into four wedges. A solid dessert for sure, and one that you'll want to share.\n\nThe second almost made me forget why I came here in the first place. The zeppole ($5.50) were soft, warm pillowy mini doughnuts of deliciousness filled with plenty of nutella. Coated with plenty of sugar, it's a sure-fire cure for any sweet tooth. If you're sharing with a kid, like I was, make sure you get extra napkins because most of the sugar and nutella ended up all over his face.\n\nWhile not quite living up to the lofty expectations I had, Settebello is a great family-friendly dining option, especially if you're craving pizza Napoletana.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":2}

This is another tomato sauce pizza that is really good.\n3) Emilia (white pizza): Prosciutto, panna (cream), mozzarella, parmigiono reggiano, basil, olive oil.  Excellent and tasty white pizza.  The creamy consistency is delicious.\n4) Vico (white pizza): Sausage, fennel, red onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, basil, olive oil.  The sausage and red onions on this pizza are delicious.\n\nBasically all the pizzas are really good.  The bruschetta is good too but needed a little salt in my opinion.

They burnt all 4 pizzas which is absolutely ridiculous. ONLY GO WHEN AUGUSTINE IS WORKING ALONE. The cooks other than Augustine have burnt every single pizza that I have seen come out of the oven. I saw the two cooks and they both were not paying attention and we're talking to each other while the pizza was cooking. Whether the oven is hot or not, they both burned all of the pizzas that came out of the oven. I would rather pay double for Augustine to make and cook the pizza because he doesn't burn it first of all and the flavor is more deep and the mozzarella is perfectly melted. I feel like I wasted my money and time today because I cannot even eat the crust or the bottom of the pizza because it was all completely soggy and burned. Like what I am left with to eat... The toppings?! I think Augustine should be the main chef at Settebello because he is consistently making perfect pizzas which is the only reason why we go there and gave 5 stars in the past. I will not be going there anymore except on Sunday's when Augustine works there and the two other cooks are not. My point is why should I pay $45 for a couple burned pizzas? Also, I usually don't like to write bad reviews, like last time I was there, there was strand of blonde hair and well what do you know... the pizza was burnt.

My mom's older dog became quite sick with artheritis and he was prescribed meta cam. The vet scared me into thinking it was a spinal tumor (because he knew I work in a human neurosurgery unit in a hospital) and said that the dog needed all sorts of expensive tests (X-ray under sedation, blood work etc) and it would all cost like $700+. I left crying because my moms dog was so sick and in pain he was shaking from the pain. Later he was prescribed METACAM for his pain and my mother sent me down there from her home to pick it up for her while she stayed with the dog who was in really bad shape. \n\nMy mom though because her credit card was on file and her dogs had been patients at Banks for 10+ years that it wouldnt be a huge issue to give the $79 metacam to me. But it was. They refused to issue the medication to me without payment on the spot and wouldnt run the credit card even by talking to her on the phone. So I had to drive back to her house pick her up and bring her down all while the dog is in agony at home. The receptionist said \"i'll check with the doctor\" and the older gentleman refused to give the medication without payment, something which had been done before with a different vet at the same place. It's not even like it wouldnt have been paid for my mother was willing to drive down right after to give them the money we were more concerned with not leaving the dog alone in agony which this vet didnt care about.\n\nI've heard other bad things about this office so I'd take my pet elsewhere.

The PT facilities and cafe are very nice. Only one patient per room. Flat panel TV, fridge and microwave in each room.\nCons. Like most skilled care and rehab facilities in AZ, I never saw an RN. Most care is from nursing assistants (graduates of 1 month training programs). They have LPNs (Licensed Practical Nurses with one year of training) in charge and giving the meds instead of registered nurses. When my friend declined to take one of the routine meds, I saw the LPN reach into the dispensing cup with her bare hand to remove the med that my friend did not want to take. That means she touched all of the meds in the cup with her bare hand. That is a big infection control no-no.\nOverall, an OK place if you need daily physical therapy and occupational therapy and are not in good enough health to make the commute each day.

He went in on a stretcher with a feeding tube and left without needing the tube and just days away from no longer needing the wheelchair! \n\nWe were skeptical about going into skilled nursing but I toured places in the area and read the health department reports and determined that Sante of Chandler was going to be the best option for him.  Sante of Chandler has not had any bad marks (discrepancies) in years from the health department, NOT ONE! The health department can ding them for the smallest thing (I read one from another company that they were given a bad mark because they had a social event with ice cream and the server walked away from the ice cream and the lid was off!) so this is quite an accomplishment. \n\nWe did not run into one person at Sante of Chandler that we felt shouldn't be serving the guests. I saw a lot of professional people working really hard at getting folks back on their feet. My father in-law was treated with respect, dignity and allowed to make choices when he could. We did have a couple of little bumps while there but I went to the case manager, Pam, and she handled them with a smile. I felt comfortable leaving my loved one with them and knew they would take care of him like I would. \n\nWe had several meals in the restaurant and the food was really very good. I don't know why but I wasn't expecting that! I was happy that we had a set menu (strawberry chicken salad is so good!) but also offered daily specials. My father in-law started out with food restrictions, which the restaurant handled with ease. \n\nI want to mention also that we had a day when his feeding tube clogged, only twice in 7 weeks, so hats off to Sante of Chandler! The first time it was simple for them to fix but the second time they thought maybe we should have it replaced. One of the nurse, Jennifer, asked if she could take a look at it and was able to unclog it herself and thus saving my father in-law from, what could have been, a painful procedure! We thought that was just amazing! She was just one of the caring and dedicated nurses at Sante of Chandler. \n\nThere are so many people there that are fantastic and we really do miss them. We were there for 7 weeks so we formed bonds. I would suggest, if you are looking for a place for a loved one and if you are on here you are, call them, go on a tour and look at the health department reports. They are only human so, if there is a problem, talk to them and let them know what you would like for your family member and then just stand back and watch it happen.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0}

I made sure I called in the morning and made a late afternoon appointment for me, my sister and my niece for my nieces birthday. She wanted to get her toes done, so I thought it would be fun for all of us to get it done together. When we got there, right around our appointment time, they were slammed. Yes I understand they randomly get busy with different people and different parties, hence the reason I made an appointment. After waiting a half hour after our appointment time, they put me and my niece together and put my sister clear over on the other side. So we weren't all able to talk and visit while getting our toes done like I wanted to. Our pedicures were also rushed and I feel like done half..... you know what. They did this because they were busy and had to get everyone in. My niece and I ended up getting done 20 minutes before my sister so we had to wait another 20 minutes to leave. It just wasn't the great bonding experience we wanted for my nieces bday. There is no point in going in a group and making an appointment when nothing is accomodated. Also it shouldn't take 2 hours to get 3 pedicures done, especially with making an appointment! It threw off the rest of my nieces bday plans for the evening!

When she heard me telling Tracy that I did that, with a judgy attitude she was shocked I removed them on my own. Sorry but I can use acetone and soak them off on my own. No need to pay you to do them for me. Plus just the look and tsk tsk tsk she gave me was not called for. \nAnyway. Back to Tracy. I asked for rounded nails and she gave me square wide nails. One was completely crooked. But I was just ready to leave the place. \nSo here we are exactly two weeks to the day and two nails are completely lifting.

The tech said she got her lashes done there.

The result was so bad. At the end of the day she had clumps of lashes falling out, her whole left eyelid was missing 1\/3 of the lashes.

She had to schedule a removal from a profesional eyelash company to have the lashes professionally removed. ($25)\n\nIn total she spent $185. We called the next day and went to explain the issue. The manager was a joke, said that there was nothing he could do, and they do not offer any refunds. We asked for $50 back and said that was fair, to which he laughed, took 3 days to reply, and did not give any resolution. \n\nPlease be warned that while they are nice, and the salon is clean, they should not be offering services such as lashes or gel manicures.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I've been coming here now for probably 6 months and they always do an excellent job. I highly recommend them.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

My friend and I went here to get pedicures and how I wish we wouldn't have. While the place seemed clean, it was dead for a weekend (that should have been my first hint). Two guys did our pedicures. My friend got a basic color and I asked for a design from one of their pictures that were in the book on the table. Well my friends toes were cut in a \"u\" shape, dipping down in the middle and high on the sides-she was so confused, had the guy ever given a pedicure before? My design looked anything like the picture and ended up looking more like jail stripes than the cute summer chevron I had asked for. When it was time to pay my bill was more than what the sign said, but I never received a breakdown, looking back I probably should have asked, but we were meeting my mom after and needed to go. \nFlash forward, my second toe on each foot has been bothering me since the pedicure... saw a medical professional and they told me the place gave me a staff infection as well as an ingrown toenail. Y'all a STAFF INFECTION! I have been getting pedicures my whole life and never experienced anything like this. I'm new to the area and was just looking for a new place to get my nails did...

I stopped in for a late morning brunch today and was surprised to find Cooper's was relatively empty. There was a soccer game on TV and a dozen fans sprinkled around the bar, but there were open tables galore. SCORE!\n\nVegetarian options here are pretty plentiful. Several vegan dishes are possible with a helpful waiter and some small tweaks. For veg heads:\n\nBreakfast-y:\n-breakfast sandwich (eggs, cheddar, spinach on english muffin)\n-vegetarian scrambler (changes daily, today it was eggs and a combination of veggies and feta)\n-oatmeal brulee (oats and apples with custard under a sweet crust)\n-banana french toast (banana bread in a brown sugar custard served with maple syrup and fruit)\n-granola\n\nLunch-y:\n-hummus appetizer (beetroot hummus topped with olives, feta, chive oil, and crispy chickpeas served with lavash crackers)\n-sweet potato chili (roasted sweet potatoes and black beans with chipotle, topped with dubliner cheddar, sour cream, and scallions. Comes with cornbread)\n-several salads\n-veggie sandwich (roasted zucchini, red peppers, carrots and portobello mushrooms on wheatberry bread with hummus, feta, and oven-dried tomatoes)\n-grilled cheese\n\nToday I got the sweet potato chili sans dairy toppings to make it vegan and it was really delicious. Spicy and super flavorful! I'll be back just to have a heaping bowl of the stuff. In the past I've gotten the veggie sandwich (very solid), and the hummus appetizer (great for sharing and lots of tasty items to nosh in the arrangement).\n\nOverall I give Cooper's 4 out of 5 for veggie options at an omnivorous hangout. There are some solid ones, including a couple creative items like the oatmeal brulee. It would be fantastic to see a meat-free burger of some sort, but in the mean time Cooper's is doing a pretty good job.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I was so excited to try out Cooper's! Even with the fantastic location, look of the place, and what's on the menu (in theory), it was very disappointing. \n\nTo be clear, server was pleasant and prompt, especially given the size of the group we had. The noise level got so high that we were practically screaming to hear eachother, much less the server, the poor thing.\n\nAnyhow my true sorrow lay with the food.\n\nSadly they were out of the bone marrow, the dish that I had really been looking forward to trying. (Always comparing bone marrows!) So, instead I split a variety of dishes with a friend. We got the Brie en Croute, Mussels du Jour, and Pork Belly Mac.\n\nThe Brie en Croute itself was very tasty. The fruit and nuts they served it with seemed to serve more in a visual capacity rather than enhancing the taste of the dish but were amusing enough to nibble on. The bread was frustrating. It was ridiculously tough and nearly stale tasting. Nothing more fun than trying to salivate enough to be able to chew your food into submission! I ended up giving up on it all together. \n\nThe Mussels du Jour were ok? I think? The dish seemed confused about itself. The mussels themselves and the broth were delicious. However the dish was topped with fries. Odd but not entirely out of place taste-wise. Then we got under the first layer and there were slices of plain boild potato under it! Not only was that aspect bland and unappealing, it just seemed straight up cheap. A way to make the dish seem bigger than it truly was. I was also very disappointed that we didn't get bread to soak up all the broth, one of the best parts about mussels prepared this way! (May have dodged a bullet there considering the bread from the brie)\n\nThe Pork Belly Mac had a good base. The mac itself was perfect. Well textured pasta with a slightly sharp and thick cheese sauce (I did have to carefully extract a piece that wasn't coated in the other ingredients to find that out. Why the hell would you make a good cheese sauce only to shove it under loud clashing flavors?!). The pork belly was fantastically crisp on the outside and full of deliciously melty fat on the inside, a perfect substitute for my lack of marrow. The little onion crisps were a perfect match and I could have just eaten a bowl of those like fries! Unfortunately they felt the need to add sriracha and pickled pears. I'm a bit of a sriracha sloot but that flavor of heat was incredibly out of place in this dish. It overwhelmed all the positives and let you really soak in the failings of the dish. The pickled pears solo were fun, but they were added to the dish in massive chunks. I think the flavor combination may have made more sense if the pears had been in smaller pieces. \n\nOverall it just seemed like Cooper's was trying far too hard to come up with some unusual striking combinations without paying any attention to the end product. There were so many interesting looking dishes but the execution is so sloppy. Very annoyed that I paid so much for small portions of disappointment. \n\nThe good news is the beer list is fairly extensive so kill your taste-buds with a few brews!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I had the Cooper Burger, which had great flavor.  The cocktails were ok... I tried to order one a little less sweet, and the bartender just didn't seem to understand why I would want that, and didn't make it as ordered.

But, I've been there three times and each time my experiences has gotten a little worse. The service got worse and unfortunately the food just wasn't as great the first time, but I still recommend this place for a go to spot in Madison. So here's my two cents on the food as long as you're prepared for a wait at the door and hit or miss service...and i guess food in some instances.\n\nFirst--get the beer cheese pretzel. you will not regret it. Their beer cheese dip has to be my absolute favorite ever. Now, i say that because the first two times i got it, it was heaven. Hot, ridiculously flavorful and gooey cheese with the perfectly salted pretzel, i have been to heaven twice with this app. however, the third time ordering it the cheese was a little colder and given to me in a plastic side dish rather than their insulated (or more insulated) glass. But anyways, just make sure you order the beer cheese rather than the mustard and you'll be good. \n\nI have also gotten the pork belly piggy mac twice and not regretted it a bit. I will say it is not the best pork belly by any means, but it is a hefty portion and the cheese mixture that they use is so good, my friends that came with me were raving about it the next day. one of them even had leftovers and couldn't wait to eat it the next day, which fun fact! If you can't finish the piggy mac, eat it the next day as leftovers and it's going to be just as good. \n\nLastly, the grilled cheese, corn Caesar salad, and frites are all good. not super exceptional...maybe the grilled cheese because they have goat cheese and i'm a sucker for that, but everything else is good. As aforementioned the service is hit or miss, so hope that you get a good server and that the food comes out hot and you'll be a happy camper.\n\ntil then, happy eating!","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I also got a Fat Tire which, at $5, was a little pricier than I'm used to, but I also need to blame myself a little because for that same price, I could've gotten a far more unique drink.\n\nI'd say it's a pretty sure thing I'll be back there before I leave this town.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

How could it not be? On my most recent brunch trip, my friend was feeling torn between getting eggs benedict or poutine, until I pointed out that not ONLY is there something magical called a Poutine Benedict (think poutine with poached eggs and hollandaise), it's only $6! What a steal. And it's as great as you want it to be. My friend wisely asked for a side of gravy with hers, which I did not think to. We shared it the gravy with our respective poutine benedicts -- highly recommend the side of gravy, as there wasn't enough hollandaise to dip fries in. Also the gravy is just delicious.\n\nThe tap list is always impressive, but the bloody mary I got failed to meet my expectations. It might have been strong, but it was watery and nearly flavorless. I don't know how that is even possible in a bloody mary?! Also, our service was pretty terrible. Among other things, I asked for hot sauce and didn't get it until 3\/4 through the meal, after asking yet again. Our water glasses were also empty a lot. \n\nMy dinner experiences are what drag my rating down from 4 to 3 stars. Most recently I ordered the pretzel crusted chicken, which came with butternut squash hash and a mustard cream sauce. The hash was delicious, but the chicken was super dry and hard. What made that worse, was that there was nowhere near enough mustard sauce to salvage the chicken, make it softer or more flavorful. In general, I just wish their menu was a little more extensive.\n\nMy advice: go to Coopers for drinks and poutine, or for brunch -- but don't order the bloody mary. Come to think of it, my friend ordered and Irish coffee and wasn't too impressed with that either. I'd stick to beer.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Finally went for dinner tonight with my wife and was quite disappointed.  \n\nAs many other reviewers have mentioned, Coopers has a horrible layout and always feels cramped, so we decided to sit outside, even though it was unseasonably chilly.\n\nService: Ok.  The waitress was very nice, though she forgot to bring us water the first time we asked for it.  She also didn't tell us the specials (although the host had when we were looking at the menu and deciding whether or not to dine there, so perhaps he told her that ) but ultimately she redeemed herself (more on that later.)\n\nDrinks: My wife and I both ordered a mojito, even though it was pretty cold out.  Big mistake, and not just because of the weather.  The drinks were watery and the mint was wilting and brownish which made it seem like a large glass of rotting leaves.  But booze is booze and I could have overlooked this.\n\nMenu: Coopers has what looks to be an incredible menu.  There were a number of items that sounded really good and I was already plotting my return voyage while I was making my choice.  But alas...\n\nAppetizer: About four months ago I tried bone marrow for the first time at Graze and was absolutely blown away.  It was rich, decadent, and seemed to hold the very essence of beef in its silky embrace.  I don't know if Graze is just buying much better marrow bones or if their doing something in the preparation, but the marrow at Coopers was nothing like what I had at Graze.  It was flavorless and fatty, difficult to scoop out of the bone and disturbingly pink at points.  It came with only four small pieces of bread, so you had to slather an enormous amount on each one (which, by the way, so many restaurants do and i don't know why... bread is cheap.)\n\nSpeaking of bread-- I appreciated that the waitress warned us that the appetizer would take 20 minutes to prepare (although I wonder why this isn't written on the menu).  I would have appreciated it even more if she would have offered us some bread or something to munch on while we drained our watery mojitos.  As it turned out, Coopers has some really good baguettes.  In any case, all that is a minor complaint compared to...\n\nThe Entrees:\n\n1. Pork Belly Mac and Cheese-\nI ordered this one, and kind of liked the first bite.  But after two or three bites I just couldn't go in-- it was overwhelmingly sweet.  The pork belly sweetness would have been a good thing if it was offset by the sharpness of the cheddar.  But its not.  In fact, I'm not even sure that this was cheddar at all, though the menu claimed it was.  It tasted like the sweet ricotta filling that you get in a cannoli.  When my wife tried it she had the exact same experience.  She proclaimed the first bite to be \"delicious,\" then put down her fork after two more, gagging on the sweetness.   \n\n2. Beef Stew on \"Dumplings\"\nMy wife ordered this.  It was terrible.  Really, really terrible.  A thin layer of spaetzle is not what I (or anyone) would expect by \"dumplings.\"  The beef looked like poop and didn't taste much better.\n\nThe Resolution:\nThe waitress came to the table when we had both eaten about 20% of our meal.  We said that we were finished and she asked if we would like our food wrapped up.  When we said no, she said that must be because we were so full.  No, I said.  The food just wasn't good.  She comped us for the entrees which was the right thing to do.\n\nMEAL #2: Brunch\n\nMy parents were in town and we were looking for  a place to grab brunch before we left.  Again, everything on the menu looked really good.  Again, it really wasn't.  I ordered eggs benedict.  I don't know how you could possibly make a hollandaise sauce that ins't tasty, but Coopers managed it.  The corn beef hash my dad ordered was also just bizarre-- it looked like little shreds of corn beef and was garnished, rather bizarrely, with fruit.\n\nThe waiter was really fantastic and the atmosphere was nice, but once again the flavors just weren't there.\n\nI highly doubt we'll be going back.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

The interior is casual and charming, it feels inviting with the wood floors, old fashioned triple ceiling fan and brick walls.\n\nWe started with the fresh baked soft pretzels ($3.95) which I can't say I'd try again.  They tasted more like simply bread sticks than pretzels.  Fortunately the pretzel roll served with the burger seemed much more on target!  Whew.  \n\nBeing the family veg, I was pleased there were several vegetarian items on the menu, including several soup options (yay!). I opted for a bowl of the Sweet Potato Chili ($6.95) which was hearty and had enough (but not too much) of a kick.  While there were several vegetarian entrees (grilled veggie sandwich, grilled cheese, or venetian manicotti)  I elected for a salad (cue anti-climatic music).  Fortunately, my salad itself was not anti-climatic. The house salad ($5.95) was a perfect size and sported freshly grated Parmesan and croutons. AND a chunk of sourdough bread (yup, this on TOP of my cornbread with my soup - this carb lover's dreams DO come true!).  \n\nAnd true to form, the Mister declared his Cooper's Burger delish - I've been hearing about the \"pork belly\" topping ever since.

Truly a space where the concept of quality ingredients and time honored techniques yield a superior product it was with two golden, creamy arancini that the meal began and then progressing through pizza both red and white, simple and complex it was perhaps most telling that the best slices of the day belonged to the Margherita DOC with a the Buffala Mozz briny funk finding harmony in the hand crushed tomatoes yet not to be outdone the eponymous Settebello also shined as the novel pine nuts and mushrooms added an earthen undertone to the pairing of cured meats.  Truly a place where not a single savory was anything less than excellent it was without hesitation that desserts were selected and again choosing broadly the rewards were myriad; a creamy budino on par with DOCG's for best in town a clear favorite amongst many while the Bella Mela proved just as well conceptualized as the pizzas though ever more subtle - a characteristic ignored by both the Calzone and Zeppole; the first harkening a campfire's smoke and the second soft and supple but both filled to bursting chocolate decadence and all the better for it.","useful":8,"funny":2,"cool":5}

I thought their Henderson location was the best pizza I'd had in LV so that's what I expected.  It wasn't the same but it was still pretty good.\n\nLet's start off with the restaurant itself.  The place is big compared to the original and they did an awesome job with the decor, open kitchen and cool bar area.  I look forward to coming back for happy hour multiple times.  $5 mini pizzas among other food deals from 3pm-6pm ensures that.  \n\nSo my wife and I split the \"Panzanella\" salad (House Made Croutons, Cherry Tomato, Prosciutto Crisps, Red Onion, Fennel, Cucumber, Basil, Arugula, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Red Wine Vinaigrette) which was good as usual.  I really like the prosciutto crisps since they're basically super bacon bits and could've used more of them but no biggie.   \n\nThen the pizzas came out.  My wife got the Margherita DOC which was topped with fresh buffalo mozzarella as opposed to the regular cheese and well worth the $1-$2 upgrade.  I usually get the Settebello pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil) but chose to get the Pizza Carbonara instead.  I should've stuck with the Settebello.  Why mess with perfection?  Pancetta, egg, mozzarella and crushed tomatoes just sounded so good but it didn't come together as well as I was hoping.\n\nFunnily enough, when the waiter came to ask how everything was and we gave our obligatory \"fine\", he just comes out of nowhere and says \"Yeah.  I am kinda conflicted on the carbonara....\" and just walks away.  Hmmmmm.  Not enough pancetta or sauce and the crust wasn't as well done as I wanted it to be.  But after all, it was still pizza and it was good but not the best.  My wife's margherita was great.  \n\nI still have a lot of love for Settebello and look forward to bumping it up to 5 stars.","useful":12,"funny":6,"cool":10}

We started off with drinks at the bar as we waited for everyone to get there. The bar service was slow...really slow. I do hate to bash bar service, because it's quite often a staffing problem, not a speed problem with the bartender. I waited 15 minutes to get my first drink, which my friend ordered for me before I even got there. The poor bartender was crazy busy until another bartender finally joined her. They were both super friendly. My guess is, they usually staff more bartenders earlier on in the nights for Fri, Sat, Sun.\n\nWhen we were ready for food, they smartly moved us into a private dining area with glass doors. This was a wise decision on their part. This IS a family establishment as well, and some in our group were getting a tad rowdy. Good to move to keep everyone happy. \n\nThe pizza was phenomenal. We ordered the gluten free crust and it was, hands down, the best gluten free crust I have had. I actually was super skeptical it was even gluten free, so I had to ask what was in it. \n\nWe did have a little mix up with the bills at the end due to our switching from the bar to the dining area. \n\nAll in all, great time here. Props to the staff here for letting us ourselves while maintaining a family atmosphere for the rest of the customers.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

It was pretty quiet during a weekday, but there were a few people coming in to pick up their phone orders. Our server was very nice. We mentioned that it was our first time there and he explained the menu to us in detail, as well as what pizzas from Napoli were all about. We decided to share one pizza, but couldn't decide what to order. In my opinion, I feel like it's a bad sign when the menu is complicated and when I don't see anything appealing. Thankfully, our server tried his best to help us out. He asked us what kind of pizza we were looking for, and we replied, \"something with meat.\" I can't remember the name of the pizza (nor do I see it on their online menu), but he did suggest a cheese pizza made with meat sauce. He said that they don't have traditional pizzas like pepperoni or sausage. So we just went with his suggestion. We also ordered a salad and I believe it was called the Insalata. It was the simplest sounding one on the menu.\n\nI must admit I am picky about my salads. The leafy greens that are used need to be dark green and fresh! Not light green with brown on the sides. That being said, they did use good quality greens! However, I didn't really like the vinaigrette on the salad, it tasted quite bland. I prefer my dressing to have at least some taste. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the pizza either. Yes, the ingredients were fresh and hot, but the pizza was hard to eat. The main problem was that the crust was very thin and with every bite, the ingredients would just fall off. Kind of felt like I was just eating crust most of the time and it was pretty messy. Thankfully, ordering dessert was a great idea. The Tiramisu was delicious and not too sweet. The coffee flavor wasn't overpowering (or lacking) like how it was at other restaurants. I thought it was funny how they put \"contains raw egg\" in the description on the dessert menu. When we asked our server about that, he said \"Well, it starts off with raw egg, then it gets mixed with....\" Umm ok, so that means a lot of dishes start off with raw egg, right??\n\nAnyway, now I can say I finally tried it, but was not impressed. Fancy pizzas are definitely not for me. I will happily stick to my boring Pepperoni Pizzas, thank you very much!","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":2}

However the place looks like a really cool spot to be in once the sun goes down and more people start to come through.  The decor is very rustic which is nice and you can see the huge pizza over in the back of the restaurant.\n\nFOOD:  The pizzas here are meant to be eaten individually (no large pizzas to be shared) and I'm not so sure if I'm a fan of this style.  I enjoy having a huge pizza in front of everyone and everyone getting a slice.  Regardless, these are Neapolitan style pizzas which have a much chewier center while the outsides are crisp.  It had a little too much chew for my liking, but what made the pizza great was the freshness of the ingredients.  I had the Capricciosa pizza and it was a great choice overall.  \n\nSERVICE:  Our server was nice enough to explain how Neapolitan pizza differs from other types and did a good job in explaining their options on the menu.

Pizza here is a fork and knife experience:\n\nIt's beautiful and impeccably decorated and full of cute (if I was 16, I'd say hot), young dudes. The space is filled with several booths and tables and a separate bar area. All of which are super comfy.\n\nThe menu is limited: there's pizza, salads, desserts, antipasti, and several wines. Pizzas range between $8-13.50 and are 12 inches. (Pro-tip: ask for it sliced, as this dish is served in traditional Napoli style).\n\nMy hot lunch date was my Gammy. She was pretty smitten with the boys & was flirting with them (and well received). You go, Gammy and you go, Glen Coco! We were promptly seated and our server was over in a jiffy. Drinks came the next second and pizza was ordered.\n\nFirst and foremost, I am a simple pizza girl. I just like plain old cheese. I ordered the pizza with the Buffalo Mozzarella (I'm a sucker for it), basil, crushed tomatoes, some other cheeses, and oili. It was simple. The crust in the middle is very, very thin. Making oversized NYC foldable slices seem like reinforced bricks, hence the need for fork and knife. The dough was delicious. Crispy in the crust and gooey in the middle (not underdone bread gooey either). My Gammy got the Pizza Bolognese. It was so good, it smelt and tasted like spaghetti in pizza form. My Gammy was sad when she found out they didn't have any actual pasta dishes there. She loved the sauce and she's picky and a New Yorker. \n\nSettebello has been on my list forever and I got to finally check it off and was not disappointed. Solid food, slightly inflated prices, lots of eye candy, and nice ambience. It's definitely a gem.","useful":10,"funny":9,"cool":9}

On the right hand sand, you've got a standard dining area with booths and tables. On the left, you'll find additional seating including some high tops and a full bar. One of the coolest parts about the setup here is that everything is very open, so you'll be able to see the wood fire oven from just about anywhere you sit.\n\nThe menu itself is somewhat small. Aside from about a dozen pizza options, there's only a few other choices of salads, antipasti's and a couple meat trays. You're not going to find any pastas or sandwiches here but they've also got a decent wine list, a few cocktails and a handful of dessert options.\n\nThis was our first time here and were told the pizzas were personal size. However, at about 12\", it's a good size pie and for me, I'd only be able to finish the whole thing if I didn't eat anything else. As suggested by our waiter though, we ended up sharing a salad and pizza between the two of us. That was a perfect amount of food, while still having room for dessert. ;)\n\nFor the salad, we decided on the Romana. I'm not normally a huge salad eater but I couldn't get enough of this. It comes loaded with arugula, artichokes and speck, then it's topped off with a good amount of goat cheese, pines nuts and dressing. The flavor was just amazing! It's salty, it's a bit sweet and the textures perfect. Everything on the plate was incredibly fresh as well. Just a great salad all around that I'd highly recommend.\n\nMoving on to the pizza, we ended up going with the Settebello to share. Want to talk about flavor? Talk about this pizza. It might seem like a lot going on when you look at all the ingredients but everything comes together so perfectly. The crushed tomato is great and their mozzarella is ridiculously tasty. And my new favorite pizza topping might just be pine nuts. Now, want to talk about crust? Yup, talk about this pizza. It's almost bread like in the center with a very soft, chewy texture but the outside is crispy and gets that awesome char from the wood fire grill. My one and only complaint about this pizza is the amount of toppings. There was a very small amount of sausage compared to the other ingredients and some slices even had no meat on them. Not a huge deal, but the could definitely be a bit less stingy with the meat.\n\nThey're dessert worthy too! While a bit on the overly sweet side for my liking, the Bella Mela is definitely worth a try. The combination of apples, cinnamon, almonds and mascarpone is so good, you'll probably ended up wanting to eat the whole thing alone, even if you are full from dinner.\n\nSo, when it comes to pizza, we all know there's no shortage of options here in Vegas. But if you want legit, Neapolitan pizza...Settebello is where it's at! Prices aren't bad and the service is excellent too. A solid 4 stars and a must try in my book!","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":3}

My Emilia pizza had corn on it at GV and did not have ANY corn on it at Sahara (my favorite ingredient in that pizza!!!) \n\nAmbience and decor is nicer at this Sahara location with a more industrial chic look. GV's location is a little more of an italian restaurant feel.

The descriptions of all the pizzas sounded good so it was a little difficult to choose.  However we asked the waitress what was the popular and she mentioned the Diavola and Settebello. The boyfriend and I shared the Diavola, and we ordered it extra crispy and asked for it to be a white pizza instead of red.  My recommendation is if you're hungry ... don't share. One pizza is not enough for two (order your own ... plus you can try more options when you order two!) \nDiavlo has a spicy kick to it which I loved, I wish it was a little spicier.   Extra crispy is the way to go.  If you get it original the crust is crispy but when you get towards the middle you will have to use a knife and fork to eat it, or fold it in half and bite into it because it's soft in the middle.  Our friends got both the Settebello, one got the original and the other got it as a white pizza.  I definitely liked it as a white pizza.  However I am a fan of white pizzas so it might be a little biased.  With that being said, the waitress said any pizza can be a white pizza and you can add or take off anything to your liking.   Saving the best for last ... the Bella Melo pizza for dessert was delicious.  Super sweet with caramel and apples.  \n\nOverall this place was a nice place for a group of friends to get together to share pizza and have good conversations.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I would give my dining experience 5 stars for service and 3.5 for food. We ordered strictly from the happy hour menu:\n\nWe started with the arancini (friend risotto balls) and the artichoke crostini. I did not like the arancini. Whenever I see this on the menu, I typically order it. Settebello's version did not have enough flavor in the risotto. Instead, the predominant taste was that of the deep fried outside. However, I really LOVED the tomato sauce it was served with. It was super tasty and fresh. I liked the artichoke crostini much better than the arancini. It had good flavor; of course I think anything with goat cheese does. I think it could have used more balsamic reduction than just the garnish.\n\nNext we decided on the Dia Vola and the Vico pizzas. The Dia Vola was spicy, but almost so much so that I didn't really taste much else (I do have a pretty high tolerance for spice). It was still good though and I love the crust of Neapolitan style pizza in general; it was perfectly foldable. *Side note: I believe they are VPN certified which means they conform to standards that make this legit Neapolitan pizza. A VPN certification is rare and they are the only ones in Las Vegas that can boast of it.*  I enjoyed the Vico pizza much more. We ordered this for my boyfriend because he loves white pizza but I enjoyed the flavors too as they all nicely complemented each other. Again, it was good but it wasn't anything amazing.\n\nLastly, we ordered the house made crostata ricotta e Nutella for dessert. It was delicious! I wish it wasn't drizzled with Nutella because the flavor on its own was wonderful. It was just slightly sweet. Would definitely order this again.\n\nOverall, we had an enjoyable dinner and were able to order 5 dishes and a Peroni for just $30. Great happy hour prices! We left very full and we were super hungry to begin with because we had just come from the gym. Additionally, the service was excellent. Our server was Bethanie and she was very sweet, attentive, and quick. Our hostess was also a doll. Thank you ladies for taking pride in your work and making our experience so enjoyable.\n\nI think the next time I visit Settebello will be at the Henderson location. Yelpers rave about that location so I purposely came to the Summerlin location first to give them a fair review. Additionally, I wouldn't order the same pizzas again as I wasn't wowed by either of them.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Since my obsession with Grimaldi's changed to my obsession with The Pizza Kitchen, I've been pretty pizza-ed out, but still wanted to try their Napoletana style pizza. We had just missed happy hour, but I'm glad we got to enjoy their regular menu first. Their beet and goat cheese salad was fresh and a very hearty portion size for two people. The crostini con crudo featured high quality meat and cheese, but I don't think I'd order in the future since the meat kept on getting stuck in my teeth. We decided on sharing the Settebello pizza which was everything I wanted a sausage pizza to be. I enjoyed their dough and thought they had the perfect amount of salt in it. Everyone should always save room for dessert here. From all the amazing choices, we decided on the crostada, which is a tart with ricotta, chocolate chips and Nutella. It's actually not too chocolatey and very well-balance. Our dedicated server was delightful and gave us amazing recommendations, and any staff that helped us along the way was very friendly. The only complaint I have would be that the lighting in the restaurant is a bit off and distracting - it made for some weird shadows over the tables and gave me a bit of a headache. Otherwise, no other qualms about this place and hope to be back here soon!","useful":6,"funny":5,"cool":5}

The days old premade\/frozen meatballs were still cold in the microwaved \/ oven reheated dish with a undersesoned tomato sauce & good quality melted cheese. Salad was bland & without seasoning or anyother veggies...a tasteless board of bacon wrapped without a hint of dressing & good goat cheese. Both pizzas were both burnt throughout the crust & spots underneath but also undercooked & doughy elsewhere. 60 bucks for this food is criminal & the waiter argues that the black isn't burnt. Wanted to cut off any piece of the black carcoal tasting portions & tell him to eat the friggen burnt charcoal ashy pizza & tell me with a straight face it's again isn't black & burnt. SMH....we will never return to this shameful place. I can & do produce much better food myself (so much for tying your place)...minus the extremely slow, ignorant & argumentative employee who is unaware of my years of quality food preparation experience. The waiter doesn't know his customer, but is well versed in excuses for customer disappointment. Your months long experience of slinging overpriced, tastless, undersesoned, burnt & undercooked food doesn't make you a food coneisuer nor a chef\/cook.  Here's a tip...if you can't get the oven temperatures & or the dough recipe right so as not to both burn & undercooked your pizza.... close it down.  Likewise if you're charging premium prices don't serve friggen cold meatballs by reheating them in a microwave, so the cheese & sauce are super hot hot & the center of the meatballs are still ice cold. One more tip you can thank me for since your oven maybe your problem (which is a costly fix) if you failed to get it installed right in the first place....brush the crust with a butter or egg wash & it will not burn the dough & use cornmeal on the bottom (unless Ypu can get the temperature & recipe right). You're welcome & while your at it laminate the cheap, flimsy & strained cheap paper menu's....it's the first sign you're resturant is sub par... attempting to pass as an elite pizzeria. And don't microwave anything. Trash your microwave now & any cook\/chef who uses it. It was embrassing to bring my family here...I hope your family experiences the same disappointing dinning experience next time you go out to eat at another restaurant. Karma is the word you should be reminded of in the event your experience is way below standard. Below standard & over priced is what you are serving the community. It's a joke what your resturant produces...regardless of the high prices you charge. Thanks neighbor!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They never felt as good as my old ones, partially because she also didn't believe in using lenses especially for astigmatism, which I had always had before.   Granted, I should have protested more, but the end result was that I paid $150 for an eye exam and got a prescription for contacts that I never used.   It was a complete waste of money when I really didn't have any to spare.   I don't know if she got a bigger kickback from the makers of the contacts she wanted me to have or what, but it was a terrible experience.   Eventually, I did call and ask if they could write me the same prescription but for Acuvue lenses but was told that they couldn't do that without the doctor seeing how they were on my eyes.

Complain and give back!  The rice too which is hard to mess up was tasteless and gluelike, they gave us some type of cold tasteless greens. Were it not for the fact that they had all of those hot sauces on the table the meal would have been totally inedible..even for me...but geez the aftertaste..makes me want to vomit thinking about it even now, the honey reported the same bad aftertaste..I think i should report this to the health department.

As all the food looked amazing, it was a complete different case when eating it; the food was completely plain and it didn't have any the flavor.\n\nIn my own personal opinion,  I feel like the restaurant can use a few changes. When I first arrived, I thought this was a sit down restaurant, but it was  not. You go to the counter to order then find a table to sit yourself. You also get your own utensils and fill up your own drink, etc. For the price and atmosphere this place gives off, I feel like a hostess and maybe some waiters can definitely make feel this place as a sit down restaurant. Honestly, to have spent this much money for basically a drive thru place is a bit much for nothing. Also, the appetizer\/soup came out after our meals, which is a bit ridiculous if you ask me. The food came out way too fast; I mean the food was out by the time we sat down. I understand some people do not like to wait for their food, but I don't want to feel like I'm being rushed out. \n\nI feel like this can be a great place to eat.

Because it was 108 degrees outside, I didn't feel like eating hot noodles and\/or soup. I ordered the BBQ Combination. For an in a casino food court the presentation is nice. The quality and quantity of food provided was disappointing. It was dry and tough. As compared to Chinatown and factoring the bland unimpressive taste and meager portions, the price would not appeal to the value conscious crowd. But compared to the other eating establishments in this casino food court, the price is on par, about 10 to 12 dollars per plate. \n\nRemember this review is based on the BBQ offerings not the noodles. I assume they should be better. \n\nI do have a concern over the layout. There are to many tables that are too tightly packed. One has to turn sideways as you zigzag between them. They are very high tables with stools with exposed sharp corners.  Only one table is at a height that can be accessed by wheelchair persons. Unfortunately, it's located in the busiest and least accessible part of the restaurant. The path is obstructed by a gauntlet of tables, stools and people standing in line to place their orders. I saw a girl with her mother and brother park the wheelchair under the table because that table was inaccessible. Luckily, she was both strong and light enough that her two companions were able to assist her into a high stool. \n\nStrangely, eating utensils are the customers responsibility of getting from a hidden corner in the front. I would say it was the most frequently asked question I overheard. \n\nThere is a bottomless fountain service for drinks, yeah. But with the slick flooring and lack of any anti-slip matting. It is literally an accident waiting to happen. In the half hour I've been here I saw one of the employees or owners, Linda, almost do a face plant. \n\nI'm looking  forward to trying the noodles in this place  the next time I'm trapped at Silverton.

Check out the Yelp Elite Vegas page for even more reviews of this cool spot inside the Silverton Casino.   The location gets pretty packed and seating is first come first serve.  Order right up front at the cashier and wait til they bring out your food.  \n\nThis time we ordered their version of Pad Thai, a Wonton Noodle Soup, Gyoza, and Pork Belly Steamed Buns. \n\nMy wife's chicken pad thai was delicious to me albeit a bit too spicy for my wife's liking.  As far as I know, there is no variation of spicy level to choose from but I suppose asking for a milder or non-spicier version would be suggested next time.  We tried to ask for some peanut sauce to drizzle over the pad thai but they did not have any.  (Alas, this is Chinese and not a Thai restaurant)\n\nTheir wonton noodle soup was good but could use a little more salt to flavor the broth.  The wonton dumplings were of good quality filled with decent amount of stuffing and the thin noodles were plentiful. \n\nThe gyoza was standard but the smoky hot chili oil elevates it.  You also have some of the best hot mustard made here as well as red chili sauce. \n\nThe pork belly steamed buns are a must for me.  Three ample sized slow-cooked pieces of pork belly bursting with flavor hugged by a pillow of soft chewy goodness in the steamed bun.  They hit this dish way out of the park. \n\nNext time you make your way to Silverton Casino, stop by here for a pretty delicious meal!  I'll also recommend the duck.  Had that during the Y.E.E. and it was excellent. \n\nYelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 3\/100","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":4}

Our order included Wuhu noodle soup with beef, HK wonton noodle soup, pot stickers, siu mai, pork belly steamed buns, Wuhu fried rice with chicken, and broccoli and beef.\n\nOriginally, my wife wanted the beef noodle soup, but we did a swap and she took the wonton soup once she tasted handmade shrimp and pork wontons. The broth was also delicious with mushrooms, scallions, and other greens. My favorite for the night were the pork belly steamed buns. The soft, sweet bao, salty pork belly, and acidic pickled daikon, carrots, and micro greens together was a great couple of bites.\n\nOne of their signature dishes is the roasted duck which they keep on display inside the roaster and is something I'll keep in mind to order on a future visit.

The fries and the aioli really stick out in my mind because they were THAT good.  Order them.  I ate the fish sandwich (I was there on Friday), and it was delicious but pretty impossible to eat as a sandwich.  Just give me the fish on the plate!  If you insist on the bread, give me a roll or three and I'll be happy.  I wasn't really upset about anything, but I did find it mildly hilarious that I had to strategize (repeatedly) about each course of action I took before a bite.\n\nThe beer selection is decent, though other places have it better.  The atmosphere is nice.  I sat at the bar, and while the bartender was good at his job, he came out on the ass end of my opinion when the back of house screwed him with REALLY slow service.  It was lunchtime, but it wasn't so busy so as to justify 15 minutes passing (along with a pint of beer) before fries arrived.  I'm generally laid back about things, but I'm honest when I write these things and it sucked having to wait so long for the fries.  I don't really blame the bartender either, though he seemed oblivious that we had waited that long until a minute before they came out.  He gave us the, \"your fries will be right up\" line, which did not resonate well with me at the time and I remember saying something to my girlfriend that was less-than-friendly but pretty damn funny at the same time.  It was my coping mechanism.\n\nSo, there you have it.\n\nGreat fries, impossible sandwich, annoyingly slow service.  \n\nI'll admit that things may improve the next time I go there.

I was expecting a bar but it was so much more...To put it bluntly, this was some of the simplest, best tasting fare I have ever had at a tavern. In fact, even if it were not a tavern, I would go back for the food. The tomato-roasted red pepper soup was so stunningly good, I wish I had the recipe because I'm now craving it constantly. I then had the veggie sandwich. Now, I've had a veggie sandwich many, many times at many different eating establishments and believe me when I say that there are as many interpretations of this idea as there are eating establishments. This one was DELICIOUS. I have no idea what they did to it to make it taste so good but literally every component sung with flavor, including the nicely toasted Madison Sourdough bread. There was portobella mushroom, peppers, feta and zucchini and it was accompanied by a fairly large helping of mixed greens which were dressed (perhaps a bit too heavily) with a kind of Dijon topping that was also extremely tasty. My only complaint was that it was too creamy for me. Aside from the food, Cooper's has an extensive beer list and a very attractive interior comprised of blonde wood tables and floors and a large picture window looking out onto the capitol. We went two days after Christmas and they were doing a very brisk lunch business so I can only imagine what it must be like on a regular workday.

Because you expect your patrons to get well elixed before the food arrives? Let me tell you, the flavors of the food does NOT hold up to the flavors of your drinks. \n\nI suppose I should have known not to order a Italian dish (polenta) off of a mostly Irish menu. It was not only bland, it was very hot. But not out of the pan hot, out from under the heat lamp \/ out of the microwave hot. I see you Cooper's, and it ain't nearly as hot as your food. My friend had the mac and cheese with pork belly on top. The mac and cheese, aside from the topper, was dull. So so dull. Not even as flavorfull as Annie's out of the box. Find the salt, it's on a shelf, about head high. And oh my lord this pork belly was awful tasting, when it wasn't chewy and tasteless.

I ordered the sweet corn Caesar as my entree thinking it sounded delicious but when the dish came I was totally disappointed. There was hardly any taste or flavor to it. I love caesar salads but this was just bland. The hard boiled egg that came on top of the salad was pink so I got a little excited thinking it would be pickled. It was not. The question still remains why was the egg pink if it wasn't pickled? My boyfriend and I also shared the french onion soup. We get french onion soup anywhere that has it on the menu, but again the broth lacked flavor.

Bartenders are friendly and offer a great selection of beer. Last time we were in here we were intrigued by the menu and made plans to come in and try the selections.\n\nWe went in last night around 9:00 for dinner. Started out with the pretzel appetizer. The pretzel was great however the Beer-Cheese sauce they served it with was lacking salt and balance. The sauce was extremely thin like it had sat in a heating well all day and broke down. \n\nNext we tried a bowl of their French Onion soup with gruyere and a side of mixed greens. We were a little confused why you would use fat tire from out of state when after all this is Wisconsin and we have tons of our very own local brews that fit. The soup came and we could smell that something had been scorched. Regardless we broke through the broiled cheese and dug in. It had good flavor but it finished with a bitter scorched taste...the same one we could smell. Little disappointing because Onions are cheap and every chef knows a good French Onion starts low and slow to get the perfect caramelization. The side salad was just spring mix with maybe a few drops of oil. \nAlong with the soup we ordered a Veggie Platter. Not what we expected. It was 2 different types of hummus, along with 3 different pickled items. The beet hummus was what caught my eye first. Great taste but it looked like thickened Pepto on a plate...or something that comes out of Barneys mouth when he sneezes. The rest of the plate was average with Pickled Green beans, Pickled cabbage, frozen pita that was gently warmed and pickles. Not bad.\n\nWe each ordered an Entree. The beef stew with dumplings and pretzel crusted chicken. The Stew was the farthest from the description you could imagine. It was on a bed of spätzle that had been cooked long before served. The stew was tomato based with brussel sprouts and 2 small cubes of beef. Looked and tasted like it had sat in a heating well all day and reduced to a tomato paste with what resembled to once be chunks of vegetables that had been long past braised. Took one bite each and there we sat broken hearted.\n\nNext the Pretzel Crusted Chicken with butternut squash hash and a whole grain mustard sauce. The hash was just diced butternut squash with no care to show knife skills and you guessed it....those damn brussel sprouts again. There was no salt or depth to the hash and I don't know what would classify it as a hash. The brussel sprouts were overcooked and brought back in a saute pan with oil and the squash.\nThe chicken was dipped in an egg wash and dredged with pieces of pretzel and panko. Then, sadly, it was deep fried. It was a good sized breast and it was moist, but way over- salted. The whole grain cream sauce was good and a good pair. The execution on the whole dish was lacking however.\n\nThe menu reminded me of bits and pieces of a few restaurants around town where I had seen these dishes before: Unami, Cadillac Ranch a.k.a Texas Tubbs West (RIP) and Brocach. The menu was intriguing and caught my eye but it had too many directions and was all over the board from Mediterranean to new American to Scottish. \n\n\nCheers!!\n\nP.S.- Our server was great!! However when the FOH manager was addressed with the problems we had she begrudgingly comp'd the entrees and soup; then put her coat on and left for the night. \n\nDon't worry we won't be returning.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It's a short 5 minute walk from my apartment so I've been here a good number of times already. I love the beer list - with my favorite being the Monk's sour beer (not the full name of the beer but my memory is terrible - sorry!). The food has been a bit hit or miss for me and I do sometimes wish there were some more options. It's more of a comfort food menu (e.g. grilled cheese, reuben, mac & cheese, etc.) but sadly without the option of cheese curds! The upstairs is great and if it is open - I would definitely recommend going up there. I also love that this is a go-to place for any soccer games including the world cup, English premier league, & Spanish premier league! It's always great to connect & cheer on with other fans :).

It's definitely got the well-worn gastropub feel, even though it's brand new. I was really impressed with the decor, even though it isn't quite as charming as some of the other nearby establishments (though if it sticks around for a while, that will come with age). On a Friday night at around 8pm, our little twosome got right in even though I was worried that there would be a wait. We were seated near the kitchen, which meant waitresses flying around too close to my chair for comfort, but at least we got to eat soon after we arrived. We had to try the poutine, skin-on french fries with some cheese curds covered in a brown gravy (have I mentioned how my boy loves gravy?). What a tasty treat, although I think it had sat somewhere for a little bit too long because the gravy had taken on an unappealing sheen. That being said, it tasted great and the fries weren't soggy at all. This is a great alternative to cheesy bacon fries, if you're into that sort of thing. This is not health food. For our dinners I went with the reuben (with house-cured lean corn beef sliced thin, cured red cabbage, swiss cheese, and dressing on pumpernickel) and he had the burger, which was very juicy. For my side I chose the greens with house vinaigrette and he had homemade potato chips. Both of these were great, and I appreciate the lighter choice of greens (they definitely don't scrimp on portions either.. I got half a plate of romaine!). We were very satisfied with the food we'd chosen. I also got a Murphy's Irish Ale, served in a true pint glass. Our server was attentive, no complaints there. The only thing I was a bit bothered by was the beer options. While the bottle selection was just fine, I'm a draft girl and there weren't that many appealing options. Hopefully the cooper's tavern will have a rotating schedule and maybe offer this poor grad student some specials (maybe pitcher specials) so that I can continue to eat my way through the menu one weekend at a time!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The blueberry marscarpone that comes with the french toast is amazing and they give you plenty so you don't run out.

We sat inside, I forget why, but in the future I think I would try to avoid it--they have this set-up with a long bench along the wall, tables, and chairs on the facing side, which gives it more of a fast food feel than I really like, plus the tables are TINY.  I felt like I was being squashed into people on both sides of me, and it was noisy.\n\nWe split an order of chips (fries) before the meal, and they were AMAZING.  Really well done, just the right texture for me (relatively thin for home-made chips, but still just a little soft like I like them, not too many burnt ones), and they came with a DELICIOUS vinegar-infused aoli for dipping.\n\nHusband had some beer that he really liked, and obviously that's their main deal.  I had some wine and it was okay, but I remember thinking that the selection was pretty thin.  I realize it's not their primary thing, but it could have had a little more variety.\n\nFor the entree, I had the grilled cheese with a \"shot\" of their Harvest Tomato soup.  I didn't realize when I ordered that they LITERALLY meant a \"shot\"--like, it was served in a shot glass, which was INCREDIBLY inconvenient since it was nearly impossible to dip the sandwich in it, even shredded into small pieces.  What do they think people DO with grilled cheese and tomato soup?!  The container really needed a broader mouth, even if it had held the same volume.\n\nThe soup was really good--very flavorful, just a hint of spice, very nice.  The server also said she THOUGHT that it was vegan, although she couldn't confirm--she said the chef likes to do vegan stuff when he can.\n\nThe grilled cheese, though, was really disappointing.  The menu listed three kinds of cheese, including cheddar, but it just had no flavor at ALL.  Totally bland.

They serve one of my favorite burgers in Madison, which may not sound like much, but truthfully I've only found two places in Madison with burgers that are actually both tasty and worth the price (The other being Dotty's, of course). Other than that their cheese curds are amazing and their fish and chips are super good. I just came back from eating the steak frites and while I didn't love them quite as much as their burger, it was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. The seasonal vegetables(green beans, tonight) were delicious, and I could see myself ordering it again if I didn't want to try everything else on their menu.\n\nThen we have the Brandy Old Fashioned. It is absolutely to die for. Seriously. No further comment needed.\n\nThird and most importantly, the service here goes above and beyond all expectations. Our server tonight was Brie and she was absolutely warm and inviting from the get go. We ran into a problem with the fish and chips being a little bit too cold (not bad or anything, just a little cool) she did everything in her power to make sure we were taken care of and happy. Luckily all it took was throwing them in the deep fryer for a minute or two; we're not too difficult. The order of fish and chips was comped by the manager, but we would have honestly been happy and I still would have written this 5-star review either way just based off how great the service was.\n\nYes, the seating is a little cramped, but I've never had a problem hearing anyone in my party or with any other restaurant goers, so I certainly don't see it as a problem.\n\n\nAll in all, the food and service here are great and definitely worth every penny.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I had the turkey sandwich with apple-pear slaw and thousand island dressing, and she had the chicken sandwich on sourdough. We both felt that the turkey sandwich won that fight, it was excellent. The rest of the menu sounds great, especially dinner. The penchant for pork products is nice to see.\n\nView of the capital is really nice. Interior is clean and modern. I liked the light wood bar. Service was great, but the place wasn't exactly bustling. \n\nI held off on giving 5 stars, because it seems like this place has a bit of evolving to do yet.

There is so much potential here ready to be unleashed, and I want to be there when you do. Unfortunately, there are a few glaring issues that prevent me from truly being your friend or your BFF. Let's keep talking to see how it goes, and we can consider a relationship later.\n\nWe visited Cooper's on a weeknight for a bite to eat and to meet with a friend. We opted to sit on the patio and enjoy the nice weather. First off, your view of the Capitol building is amazing. Second off, why do you have customers share tables? I mentioned in my Pig in a Fur Coat review that normally this is an awkward experience. Cooper's, it was awkward. I want my own table and to not share the paper pushing discussion of the two coworkers getting a bite after work.\n\nCooper's has a very solid beer list. If there isn't something on tap they have listed because you're \"that person,\" (no worries, I'm sometimes \"that person too\" so don't feel bad), there will be at least 5 beers available in bottle that you will craze. Cooper's has you covered.\n\nThere were no cheese curds on the menu... I don't know how that is possible, but it was. I guess Cooper's isn't trying to be Old Fashioned too hard!\n\nSince cheese curds were out of the option we ordered pretzels with a Guinness sauce as an appetizer. Major props on the sauce guys. Anyone can make a soft-pretzel well, but most people will serve it with garlic sauce or cheese product. While I may enjoy those at a sporting event, I want something more for dinner. Your sauce works, it's awesome. I want it bottled.\n\nNow here is where it gets awkward. I ordered the lobster mac n' cheese for dinner. It was $19, and I was expecting something solid because we're in Wisconsin so ordering a dinner based around cheese is a no brainer. It wasn't good, guys. I was greatly let down by this dish, and I do not think it should sit on the menu for $19 or exist at all. \n\nThe lobster was overcooked and chewy. I could barely taste the cheese. It's mac n CHEESE, Cooper's! I know you probably got distracted in the grocery store by that bottle of truffle oil and forgot to buy enough cheese but come on! It's unfortunate that the primary ingredients didn't deliver. Well, at least the pasta was cooked properly. \n\nBack to the truffle oil, why? I know you think you're Alinea, but you're not. Truffle oil is gimmicky and it makes everything else taste like truffle oil. It absolutely overpowered every single other ingredient in the food, which is a HUGE problem when you are serving lobster. Lobster is ridiculously easy to out flavor with other ingredients. Let the lobster shine, guys. It's the feature of the dish!\n\nThe entree did come with a salad. The ingredients were crispy and the dressing was delicious. I think I enjoyed the salad more than the main feature.\n\nService was about what I expect. Drinks were topped off, we were asked how everything was. It was nothing exceptional or disappointing. Kudos!\n\nCooper's, I want to like you, and I appreciate many things about you, but that one dish was executed so poorly that I cannot look past it. Let's continue to hang out with other people, but we can keep our options open. If we do hang out, please don't bring Dave, the lobster mac n cheese with you. No one likes Dave.","useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":1}

It's been awhile since I've been to Canada and I've been having a craving for poutin. After consulting Yelp I found this place as somewhere in the US I might go for my fix. Since I had a business trip planned to Milwaukee it wasn't much more of a drive to get to Madison. I figured if there was a place outside of Ontario or Quebec to get good poutin it had to be Wisconsin, home of the cheese curd. So on a rainy afternoon I headed to Madison. The first bringdown about this place is its location so close to the capital. Trying to park anywhere near Cooper's is a pain. And when it's raining it's even worse. Having finally found parking I then ran in the rain to get to the restaurant. I get in, am immediately seated and get a menu. A big positive  for the place is its beer selection. I was able to get a draft of a California beer I like cheaper there than when I am in California. I ordered poutin and sliders from the menu. The poutin came out first and my heart sank after seeing it. It was made with YELLOW cheese curds and the gravy was like a light brown sausage gravy. Most horrible. EVERYBODY knows poutin is made with WHITE cheese, mozzarela, montery jack or even cheddar, and a thick BROWN gravy. Broke my heart when it came out. The taste wasn't much better. The gravy and fries were barely warm so the cheese couldn't melt which made the whole thing an unappetizing mess. The sliders weren't bad but I hadn't come for the sliders. After eating I trudged back to my car in the rain. Pricewise not bad for beer but a bit pricey for the quality (or lack thereof) of the food. 3 stars for the good beer price.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

In fact, I can only recall one specific time where I ate a vegetarian polenta dish that was rather bland and uninteresting (No...the reason for that is NOT because it was a vegetarian option). The atmosphere is very lively, and a drawback from a 5-star rating would be the noise. Cooper's Tavern is certainly noisy, but that's a part of the Euro-tavern charm and experience. Also, as a coffee LOVER (a true one...not simply someone who simply drinks a lot of it), their coffee selection is abysmal. It always tastes bland and even burned at times.

I don't really like grilled cheese and only order them when there are no palatable meat-free options.  It was the usual mess of grease on bread.  The highlight was the shot of harvest soup, but again that was only a shot.  \n\nThe second time we came here was because The Old Fashioned was too busy.  I was fine with that because I'm not a fan of their food, but my friends were visiting and were really excited about the variety of cheese curds.\n\nTo make up for the lack of cheese curds, we ordered the poutine.  Having traveled extensively in Canada, I can say this was a far cry from the original (true, we did get the gravy on the side).  The cheese was lumpy, waxy mess in the middle, and the fries were cold and soggy.  We didn't even finish them, and who doesn't finish their fries?!\n\nI really liked the Venetian Manicotti, though the buckwheat crepe was rather grainy.

The whole meal made me feel sad and lonely, because I could see my friends but not talk to them.  It made us eat quickly and run out of there.  One positive note:  I think all the ambient noise mimicked the sounds of my friend's womb.  Her little baby slept through the whole meal.  It was quite nice for us grown-ups.  Too bad we couldn't talk to each other about how lovely it was to have adult conversation.\n\nI don't drink beer, so I ordered a Magner's.  It came in a pint glass, which I'm sure would have been appreciated if I were an alcoholic or like to consume 1500 calories per meal.  I drank less than half of it.

We always get great service and the food is great, we get it to-go on weeknights sometimes too!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This place was recommended by one of the hosts of Harvest which is right next to the Old Fashioned, We didn't go because it was a little too upscale for coming from the airport. This place was great, the waiter\/server gave us good insights on the popular items. Do not pass up the frenched chicken. Yeah it's a chicken dish and it's worth ordering. My wife ordered the chicken and I order the pork belly mac, pretty awesome, you need that mac to cut through the richness of the pork belly. I was up north in Wisconsin past spring green earlier that week and I recognized a few of the farms and creameries they source ingredients from because I had a chance to visit and buy some stuff from them. One of the managers was very friendly and checked on us a couple times and even stopped to have a conversation with us about moving out to the country and how he someone will get dragged up there with his boyfriend. Paraphrasing of course... Anyways.. I recommend visiting when you are in the square. Btw they have cool ceiling fans.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Well, let's qualify the food statement...I had the Mac and cheese with pork belly, which sounded phenomenal on paper, but in actuality was a bit disappointing.  The pork belly--it sounded wrong to begin with, but I thought \"OK it could be brilliant\"--was really at odds with the mac.  AND my mac'n'cheese is way better.

Unfortunately, the deal breaker would be the mild food poisoning that the two out of the 3 of us received.  The other guest received a pretty bad case of it (they ordered the fish and chips fyi)  My suggestion would be to stick with the beer or not go at all.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

So incredibly lucky to stumble upon this place our very first night in Madison for work! So incredibly sad for everywhere we've eaten after Coopers since they just can't compete with our experience there. \n\nI have to admit I was hesitant about the food we would encounter in Madison (sorry but I've spent a lot of time in the Midwest and usually end up bloated and searching for greens\/veggies\/roughage).  Coopers totally blew me away with its perfect blend of pub\/comfort food faves, locavore love, and the best things about Midwestern food (its true roots). By the time I left I was wondering why we can't have a Coopers in our town!\n\nMy meal was a delicious bavarian beef stew with German dumplings, REAL German dumplings for those who love them, artisan beer and brussels sprouts. The plate was so big, I cannot believe I ate the whole thing but it was sooooo good.  And did mention this is a regular menu item, not a special?\n\nTheir drink menu, including a nice and reasonably priced selection of wines by the glass, specialty cocktails, and an astonishing selection of beers, is impressive! And the staff was awesome!  You know where I'll be eating when I'm back in Madison next week.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I am OK with the tasteless tomato sauce some people mention, I actually like sauce like that. Some other pizzerias just add too many spices in the sauce and I don't like it.\n\nBut why, or why? Why do you burn the crust like that. Please, don't tell me that's how oven baked or wood fired pizza should be. I've tried them all and the crust should NOT be so burned. Check out my photos. It was so bad, my kids did not want to eat the pizza, in the end they ate only the mid secrion of it. \n\nThe pizza is very thin. The sauce and cheese are light. Toppings tasted good. These are all food things. That's why I give it 2 stars.\n\nOther bad things - other parts of the pizza were slightly burned as well and the toppings were unevenly spread.\n\nPlease, fix your ovens or replace them.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Wonderful antipasti dish! The beets were lovely. I was really pleased with the goat cheese crema as it was a modest amount and didn't dare overpower the beautiful beets. The almonds were a nice touch!\n\nPolpette Napoletane ($14): Neapolitan beef and pork meatballs, covered in Neapolitan tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil. The meatballs were simple and just loaded with meat and practically no filler. It's served with buttered toast that's been tossed into the oven as well; delicious.\n\nMargherita DOC ($14): Crushed tomato, mozzarella di bufala, parmigiano, and basil. This is one of my all-time favorite pizza styles and this is definitely one I'd want again. The dough and all the components created a solid Napoletana pizza. They also have a non-DOC option without buffalo mozzarella for $12.\n\nPizza Carbonara ($13): Crushed tomato, panchetta, egg, cracked pepper, parmigiano, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil. All of their pizzas start the same way, so it's the same great crust\/dough. My disappointment with this pizza was the scarcity of toppings and the cooked yolk - that's definitely not what I was expecting. Since this is atypical for Carbonara, I think it should be disclosed on the menu or as you order.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful and the vibe is classy yet casual. I love that everything cooked is thrown into the blistering-hot brick oven. I also like the non-pizza offerings and look forward to trying several of those as well. There is a happy hour during the week (M-Th 3-6PM, 8-9PM & F 3-6PM, 8:30-10PM) with most selections at $5\/each.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":3}

The meat on the pizza was less than 1\/4 of a cup. \n\nThe canoli was by far the worst canoli I've ever had. Paula Dean couldn't even save this dish. \n\nThe Worst:\n\nBoth pizzas were under cooked. Either the chef really didn't care because we walked in 35 minutes before close or because a group of 6+ walked in 20 minutes before close or because he was too occupied making sure what looked like his family was having a better meal than anyone else. \n\nI see and hear people rave about this place.

So after burning what I tell myself must have been AT LEAST a million and a half calories in the Rock 'n' Roll, I told my parentals that it was critical we get pizza. Serious. Crucial. Muy importante. \n\nWe rolled in to the new location of Settebello and the place is an Instagrammer's dream. It has a very refined, elegant feel to it that does not exude \"pizzeria\" in the slightest bit. Tons of #nofilter #woodwork #crafty #ilovepizza #canyoubelievethisisapizzaplace #noireallycant going on. \n\nLa noche began with fried risotto, which were ravioli-like envelopes of breaded risotto, and a beet salad with creamy goat cheese and nuts. I think the risotto could have stood on its own without making a detour to the fryer, but the salad was a fresh complement to the pizza. \n\nThe Family K opted for the Vico (sausage, fennel, onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, basil, olive oil) and Capriccioso (all vegetables - don't even bother if you're a carnivore), and the final tally had Vico in the lead. We were advised in advance that the thin-crust pizzas come out slightly charred, but the crust on our Capriccioso was just burnt, which is why it was Michelle Kwan that night and not Tara Lipinski. We learned that night that crushed tomato is OKAYYY but we don't love it. Since Settebello has so many options without crushed tomatoes though, I'm sure we will be back again sometime to peruse the other items on the menu. \n\n#nexttimeiwonthavejustrunahalfmarathonthoughughhh","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":6}
