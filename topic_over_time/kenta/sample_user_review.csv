I haven't bought anything here, but I've spent several hours exploring the shops.  Bauman Rare Books is one of those fantastic stores where you want to walk around with your hands tied behind your back because you don't want to touch anything and leave a print on anything.  What an interesting shop.

I also window shop and the tie shop and I smile when I think that I know longer have to wear a tie unless i want to.  

Those are just two of the neat places in the Shoppes at the Palazzo.  I sometimes wonder how some stay in business because they're almost hiding in plain sight, but many people don't know the extent of the shoppes nor the different hallways that take you to different shops on different floors.",0,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I know the space is small and I realize they charge too much for admission given that fact.  The audio tour wand included with the admission is almost worth the admission price.

The current exhibit--A Sense of Place:Landscapes from Monet to Hockney is small with a limited number of paintings and other art.  The quality, however, is excellent.  Many of the pieces are on loan from The Boston Museum of Fine Arts.  Some are from the Contemporary Museum in San Diego, and a few pieces are from the MGM Resorts collection.

I didn't have all that much time today, so I did the audio tour and moved quickly through the exhibition.  Since I have the membership for a year, I can go back another time and spend more time studying the individual works and learning more about the artists.

Again, I know the place is small, but at least we have a fine arts gallery.  With the Guggenheim closing and the West Sahara Library Museum closed, we need something like the BGFA.  It is worth having.",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

When my sister-in-law saw that there was a White Castle in Las Vegas, one of her vacation stops here had to be White Castle--something that she fondly remembers from her youth.  I am still firmly in the I don't get it column.

There were three of us and we ordered a 10 pack bag with three bottles of water.  The sliders come out to be just over a dollar each but they were missing something.  Even the devoted sister-in-law thought they were missing at the very least some salt (and she doesn't use salt very much).  

I was underwhelmed by the sliders.  The onion taste was about the best thing and it's really stretching it calling that little thin piece of beef a slider.  The thing is mostly bread.

Being in the Casino Royale doesn't make it an easily accessible place unless you're a tourist walking the Strip and decide to drop in.  We walked from the Venetian.

Again, I just don't get the cult following.  I'd rather spend a bit more and have something more substantial and a whole lot more flavorful!!",13,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

When I talked to the young man at the podium and told him I wanted to place a To Go order, I told him about the pizza and the reviews.  He told me he'd check and a short time later, he came back and told me they could make it but they didn't have the caramelized onions for it.  I told him to order it anyway.

In just a few short minutes, the pizza was brought to me as I waited in their small waiting area.  I brought it home and it was very good.  It was also the perfect size for two people.

My preference is still for thick crust, Sicilian style pizza, but I can see that Settebello will be on my rotation list.  And, I want to try some of the others as well.

If you're going to/from the pool or to/from the Bellagio's Spa Tower, or attending a meeting at one of the conference rooms down the hallway, you've gone by and maybe noticed the photos but kept going to get to where you wanted to be.  Next time, stop, go in, and enjoy the photos.

I have been on two walking photo journeys with Jeff and I find his work to be outstanding!  It is great when you're able to hear from the photographer how they composed a particular photo, how long they had to study the area to know when was the best time, and other things that a layman such as myself never think of.

A reason to visit would be to see some of the original Masad photos which will  soon be going to the museum in Israel.  Hearing him describe how he discovered and used the metal from the bunkers on the Golan Heights for his frames was a fantastic story and put the photographs into an historical perspective.

It has been great fun to watch this being built and to anticipate riding it.  I have a fear of heights and I abhor glass elevators.  This seemed to me like the making of a perfect fetal position ride.  But, I screwed up my courage, bought my ticket, and scampered into the car.  

Let's back up a bit.  You can buy tickets online, at one of the many self-serve kiosks in the Linq and other places around the Quad/Linq area.  You can also buy in person.  If you do, and you have a Total Rewards card, the $2 fee you pay online is discounted.  No special price for Nevada residents.

After getting your ticket and going through several theme park like queuing areas, one on the first floor and then another one on the second floor at the top of the escalators.  

After walking down a ramp, you're urged to move along quickly because the wheel generally doesn't stop and you enter after the people have exited on the other side.  Once everyone is in, the car door shuts and is locked.  The ride is very smooth and it was very easy for me to do.  I was so interested in moving from side to side taking photos and enjoying the view.  It really didn't bother me.

After what seemed like 10 minutes, the ride was over and it was time to exit.  I strode down the ramp with a swagger as if to say, ""Yes, I did it! Yo!""

The woman was pleasant and she made my sundae quickly.  I got the Black and Tan Sundae which is described by their menu as:  Creamy vanilla and toasted almond ice cream drowned in Leatherby's caramel and chocolate fudge, topped with whipped cream, nuts and a cherry.

It was good but at $7.35 plus tax for two scoops of ice cream, that's too pricey.  For that amount, I can be sitting in Max Brenner's in the Forum Shoppes and not in a run down, older restaurant that has seen better days.

The first page of the new menu is the Inferno menu.  All dishes on this page are made with ghost peppers.  You have to sign a waiver before eating from this menu our server RS told us.  There's one challenge that if you finish, you get your photo on their Wall of Fame and you get a $50 Mint gift card for future use.  I don't think it's accepted by any hospitals.  (Michael K, this might be something you'd want to try!)

In addition, the new menu has soups and salads and appetizers of various kinds.  There are so many things to try it seems like a good UYE with 5 or 6 people to share the items.

For tonight, I chose the Vertical Vindaloo with lamb.  The menu change also allows you to order vindaloo and choose the protein you want--cheese, lamb, veggies, goat (bone in), swordfish, shrimp--and you choose your spiciness from 1 to 10.  I chose 
7 and I could have had more spice.  8 or 9 next time.  My wife ordered the Maharaja Tikka Masala with chicken breast (again choice of protein similar to the vindaloo).  She chose a spiciness of 3.  We also got an order of buttered garlic naan.

Everything was excellent!  The vindaloo had good spicy flavor and the sauce was very flavorful.  There were cut potatoes in the sauce, too.  My wife enjoyed her dinner and she also expressed that it could be spicier.  Wow, are we going to 4 or 5 next time?  What happened to my gabacha?  The naan was the tastiest we've had here.  It wasn't quartered like other times but served in one large round that we tore apart.

After dinner, she got khir and I pistachio kulfi.  I've had the khir before and while good, I wanted to try something different.  The pistachio ice cream was really, really good.  
I asked RS if it was made in house or could I go to the Indian store and get it out of the freezer.  Sure enough, it's made in house.  There goes that idea for a repeat.

RS was quite a pleasant server!  He refilled my iced tea when I was getting low and he gave us chance to look over the menu with no hurry and then was ready to answer any questions.

My original review was 3 stars, but as a result, they've been downgraded. Just a few thoughts:

1. OK, I will never come back. Done!

2. If you are really that thin-skinned about a 3 star review where I do say the donuts are decent, but the Thai iced tea was too sweet, maybe you shouldn't be in the business of serving the masses. Hmm? Perhaps the time you have spent sending nasty messages to people that have a differing opinion could be used in adjusting your recipes, improving your marketing techniques, training your staff to be excellent at customer service, or maybe doing some relaxing breathing exercises to soothe your troubled soul instead?

3. Check out the owner's reviews. http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4F3oa1_gQec7itBLW_9oVg 
It's very classy to give one stars to your competitors! And, may I assume that this person owns Boston Donuts, given the first (And only) to review, and the 5 star rating?

Yes, I am the Yelpy evil donut fairy, traipsing around with my magic wand of misfortune cursing those poor, unfortunate donut shop owners with my 3 star reviews! Muhahaha!

Last night, I was in the theatre for the Brian Wilson and Friends Show.  The show was being taped for broadcast next year on PBS.  The only negative last night was the box office not being prepared for the hundreds of people who came to pick up their tickets at the appointed time.

The portions for restaurant week, I have noticed, are smaller than the portions you would get for a regular entree, since some of my friends got normal entrees and glancing at their meals, theirs were probably 2 times bigger.  I had the halibut, which tasted OK, but was a very tiny piece of fish surrounded by some lukewarm parsnip puree and caesar salad.  Considering that I just ate a different salad as part of the three course meal, I'm not sure why I would need more?  The sauce that came with the meal was firmly congealed to the plate, and I wouldn't really call it a sauce, more like a sticky mass that you can't really eat with the fish, for it's even hard to scrape it off with a fork.  I also tried some pork chop.  The meat was tender and was flavorful, but the outside was entirely coated with cancerous char.

Would I eat here again?  Well, I'm not so sure.  We got here at 5:30 on a Sunday night and service was pretty slow.  And, for some reason they were pouring the olive oil out on plates for bread for a completely empty table that wouldn't have people seated on it until an hour later, yet we weren't even offered olive oil/bread yet.

There is plenty of parking in front of the Cultural Center and the walkway goes from two areas of the parking lot to the entrance.

Once inside, the theatre is to the right.  In the hallway before the doors, there's a small art gallery space that has exhibitions.  I was early so I took some time to check it out last night.  A strange display is there now.

The theatre opened and since it was open seating, I could sit either on chairs on the floor arranged in am semi-circle facing the stage or I could sit on one of the theatre style chairs in the rear section.  I opted for the rear section.  It's a proscenium stage that appears to be fairly large.  For last night's show, the small group playing music were in an area in front of the stage.  The bass stuck up high enough sometimes that for a moment or two, one of the characters was blocked by the bass.  I could have moved but it wasn't necessary.

The theatre has a good set of lights for the productions done here and the seating was comfortable.

I knew from reading the reviews on Yelp that it was a small place and it is!  There are 5 tables that hold a total of 14 people.  I guess that's why it's named well and they had a number of take out visits while we were there.

I checked the daily specials board and saw pumpkin curry.  I ordered it with chicken, spice level 7 on a 1 to 10 scale.  My wife got her standard pepper and garlic chicken which does not have a spice level.  We also got an order of vegetarian egg rolls.  

Everything was very good.  The egg rolls were very good and were delivered very hot to our table.  The pumpkin curry was something very different for me and I'd certainly get it again.  I tasted my wife's chicken and it, too, was good and she liked it.  Unlike what she's used to at other Thai restaurants, Thai For To Go deep fries the chicken briefly--no coating--just enough to give a bit of crispness and cooking to the chicken.  

A couple of small things.  Being so small, the tables are small.  We would have been better off sitting at one of the two tables for four people because there almost wasn't enough room for the dishes on the table.  Also, we had our egg rolls for about 2 minutes when she came out with our main dishes.  Perhaps I need to ask people to wait, but I really like some time to enjoy the appetizer before having to start the main course.  Again, due to its size, there's no customer bathroom available without going through the kitchen.  We didn't use the bathroom but we noticed one of the customers going into the kitchen to get there.

The shop had a water dispenser at the rear of the store with cold water with lime and some rose petals to add flavor to the water.  It was cool and a nice palate cleanser after the gelato.  

Before heading out, I got a gâteau Basque and two black and white truffle macarons.  The macarons, listed as savory on the card by them, had a flavor that was off putting to me.  The Basque was excellent.  They had three flavors available and I got the fig.

Grand jury summons?! Different thoughts floated through my head as I opened up the narrow envelope that would hold my future fate on a Friday in November. Grand jury, sounds serious! Some friends told me to just start shouting ""Guilty!"" while pointing at random people in the courthouse. Surely that would help me get dismissed? 

Just kidding of course. It's not really my favorite place to be but hey, it's what I am signed up for by being a U.S. citizen so I don't mind. 

For those driving here the parking garage is on 8th Avenue and Jefferson Street and there are plenty of spots to choose from. There are clearly labeled signs as you exit to wait for the shuttle that will take you to the courthouse. Our shuttle driver was very kind and courteous and was good at explaining the procedure to us, and where to wait to be picked up. The shuttle runs about every 15 minutes and is a large charter bus with comfy seats.

Once you are at the courthouse you go through the metal detector then use one of the kiosks to get your printed juror badge. It helps to know how many years of school you've attended since that is one of the questions you will be asked as my sleep deprived mind tried to figure it out (I've been in school forever it feels like) while other people in line patiently waited for me to finish.

The waiting area is quite spacious, as others note, similar to the set up of an airport waiting area (Minus the screaming kids and rolling suitcases). The main area has a lot of TV screens showing different channels, with a corridor that leads to the vending machines, microwaves, and restrooms. Beyond this corridor is a study area with a cubicle set up. Each cubicle has an outlet for your chargers. 

There are several areas with water coolers available. I had heard that some people received cookies or other pastries with coffee during their summons. I didn't see any in the break room for us. Boo! I want my jury duty cookie! 

Having been called a few other times to be part of a trial jury, the grand jury process was fairly similar. For us, out of the 70+ people there 16 would be on the jury with 10 alternates. The actual courtroom we were in was spacious and it was easy to hear what everyone was saying.

I've been to Big Al's Comedy Club several times.  Like any other comedy club, how good it is depends who's booked for that week.  I've seen as bad as Kato Kaelin and I've seen some good comics.

The venue is odd because it once was a restaurant in the Orleans.  The entrance is almost directy across from the buffet entrance.  There are two rows of plush seats in the front.  These are people who are being comped or have gotten their early to try to get seats close to the front.  On the left side facing the stage, there are some booths that also have some chairs, but the largest section--the middle--is made up of longer tables with seating on both sides and that hold 8 people.

The club is open Wednesday through Sunday and there is one show at 8 PM.  Cost is $19.95 which includes tax and one drink.  

Last night, I saw Kristeen Von Hagen and Danny Villalpando.  Both were funny, but with only two comics other than the MC who only does a brief stint, both featured comics seemed long.

It is an OK venue and depending on the people booked, it's a good club to attend.",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Today, we had breakfast or lunch depending on who ordered what.  We also had a birthday cake we brought served to one of our hikers as a surprise.  The crew at Bonnie Springs were very helpful in helping us with the surprise.

I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries, and it was very nice.  Two others had the pulled chicken, and they were pleased with that.  Three people got breakfast, 2 omelets and some blueberry pancakes, and they enjoyed their meals.

All in all, it was a good place to stop.  The food took awhile getting ready.  This is my only complaint.  

One funny thing, as you wait, you can watch the ducks and swans swim by in the pond outside the restaurant.  A few times, the swans swam by and with just the neck showing, it looked like something out of jaws.

I recommend this place if you're out in the Red Rock area.  There is no admission fee if you're there simply for lunch or dinner.",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
YTqtM2WFhcMZGeAGA08Cfg,8,2015-03-01,6,bgNifYGgRQWfnKRNaXp3QA,3,"I recently found this place on Yelp and decided it was a must try.  Before leaving the house last night, I saw a Yelp friend had just checked in.  When I got there, I joined his wife and him as they finished up and I ordered.

The chips were standard fare but the salsa was very good because it had a good spiciness to it which I like.  

For an appetizer, I ordered three shrimp empanadas and for the main course I got the carnitas platter.  I also got a Diet Coke which was served in the can with a straw.

My error was in ordering the two things at the same time or not specifying that I wanted the empanadas first and then the main.  Instead, both dishes were brought at the same time.  The empanadas were very hot (temperature).  The carnitas were lukewarm at best and the food was plated on a cool dish making the beans, rice, and carnitas all not very hot.  This is so different than most Mexican restaurants where you sometimes can hardly touch the hot plates.

The empanadas were the star of my meal.  They were very tasty with a good amount of shrimp pieces in each one.  The green sauce that accompanies them was excellent.  Another spicy sauce that helped make this dish a winner.  Unfortunately, the carnitas were a fail.  The meat was dry and I need to put some Tapatio on for flavor and for moisture.  The beans and rice were standard.  

I was going back and forth between my appetizer and my main course at the same time and this detracted from the enjoyment of the meal aside from the temperature problems with the carnitas noted above.

The servers were very friendly and helpful.  As other reviewers have noted, this is a small, hole in the wall restaurant that doesn't seat a whole lot of people at one time.  I joined my friends and there was an extra bit of wait for service--my fault because I didn't stop anyone to let them know I wanted to order.  When brought a menu, it had dripped salsa on it in two places.

There was live music last night with two talented guys.  It was however very loud.  We really had to speak loudly to each other to be heard.  

If I come back, it would be for a shrimp cocktail that looked very good (the neighboring table ordered one) and I'd come back for the empanadas.  

Finally, you shouldn't have difficulty finding this restaurant if you go to the Charland Plaza at the corner of Charleston and Maryland Parkway.  Just go in the door under the open sign and you won't enter the beauty shop as I did.

They have some unique flavors, including some holiday flavors like peppermint, gingerbread, and eggnog.

The cookies included with the sandwich are either chocolate chip or molasses but you can also upgrade to a premium cookie (A chocolate chip oatmeal concoction) for $10. I felt like mixing it up so I had a chocolate chip on one side and a molasses on the other. 

The ice cream itself was great and I loved the bits of gingerbread mixed in with the ice cream. The cookies though tasted too sweet for my tastes so when I bit into the sandwich all I could taste was a generic sweetness rather than the actual ingredients. Also, while the molasses cookie had a nice chewiness that made it easy to eat with the soft ice cream, the chocolate chip was harder.

Service was warm and friendly. If I'm in the area and craving ice cream I'd go here again.",7,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

This tiny little hole in the wall offers a small selection of Filipino favorites. Most of the food will be preprepared in trays and you pick out what up want. When we came here there were about 6 items available in the serving trays. Dishes seem to rotate on a daily basis so each time you are here there will be a different menu. When we went we had 4 out of the 6 available: dinuguan, pancit, lumpia, and sinigang. The food looked like it had been sitting in the trays all day so I tried to steer clear of anything that might not keep well over time.

Each plate comes with a mound of rice and the portions were very generous. The lumpia was very crispy but there wasn't much filling in it so all I could taste were the crispy outer layers. The sinigang had a hearty savory/sour taste to it with slow cooked pork and vegetables. It was good for the first few sips but I got a little tired of the taste after a while. The pancit was great. The rice noodles were well cooked and it came with shrimp and vegetables with a slice of hard boiled egg on top. I also enjoyed the dinuguan, an earthy rich pork stew that had a hint of spicy kick to it.

Drinks are by the bottle or can and are in a small fridge off to the side. 

Overall it was a decent experience. I do prefer the ambiance of At My Place Cafe though, which is in the same shopping plaza and also offers Filipino food. I've only tried At My Place Cafe's breakfast though, so TBD which Filipino main dishes in this plaza reign supreme!",19,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The other TPC course in our area is a private course, so this is where I headed today.

I got the Southwestern Eggs Benedict which according to the menu consists of roasted corn cakes, chorizo, fried eggs, chile cheddar cheese, pico, green onion, avocado, and breakfast potatoes.  In today's case, it was missing pico and avocado, but it was very good nonetheless.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the corn cakes and I liked the different take on Eggs Benedict by going with the corn cakes instead of an English muffin.  The corn cakes were very tasty!

Service was excellent. I sat at the bar and Theresa was the server.  She was a very pleasant woman and very efficient.  It was nice chatting with her about breakfast places and it was so nice looking out the windows at the view of the mountains on the west side of town.

They offer a dinner buffet for $11, soda is $1.50.  There are a good selection of meat dishes, vegetable dishes, and some desserts.  Naan is served freshly baked at your table.  

Although there is a wide selection of meat and vegetable dishes to choose from, not all of the dishes are labeled, so you are left with trying out ""brown colored curry with mystery meat"" or ""light cream colored mystery blob.""  Despite the variety, the dishes themselves were a bit hit and miss.  I wasn't a big fan of the pakora curry (or ""light cream colored mystery blob"" to some), it was a bit too sour tasting.  The chicken tikka masala was decent, and dessert was pretty good (gulab jamun, rice pudding, fruit custard), not extremely sweet like some desserts at Indian restaurants can be.  The naan was decent, not the best I've had but it came in a large basket and there was plenty of it to go around.  

Generally, I like that they offer dinner buffet here, since most Indian restaurants offer lunch buffet only and just entrees for dinner.

It turns out that I've walked by it a number of times and never knew it was a restaurant.  I only thought it was a bar/lounge.  But, behind that large fish tank is another side and that's where the restaurant is.

I was seated promptly right along the glass of the fish tank.  It's a great place to sit because you are almost constantly watching the fish swim when you're not eating--eating seafood even.  I wonder if anyone would like an enclosed, sealed calf range in a steak house.  

My server was Haley and she was good.  She took my order after answering a few questions.  I was brought my iced tea (blackberry, bottled Republic of Tea) and a runner brought some bread and butter.  The bread was OK.  The rye roll was good.  It was brought warm.  The flat bread, soda wafers were quite dry and not as good.

For a started, I ordered the ménage soup.  It's a trio of small cups of their three soups--lobster bisque, gazpacho, and clam chowder.  The gazpacho was hands down the best.  The clam chowder was good.  The lobster bisque was average.

For the main course, I got their spicy yellowfin ahi served with a ginger soy sauce and wasabi cream and accompanied by wasabi mashed potatoes.  The ahi was cooked very rare--just seared and off the grill.  It was excellent and the wasabi sauce was very good.  The wasabi mashed potatoes were also very good.

For dessert, I had ordered the hot chocolate lava cake.  The menu states to leave 30 minutes prep time for specialty desserts and when I was ordering dinner in the beginning, Haley asked me about this.  I ordered the cake then so there'd be plenty of time to make it at the correct time during my meal.

The cake was excellent.  Chocolate goodness topped with Heath bar crunch and vanilla ice cream.

The meal and service were very good and the fish tank is lots of fun.  It was a hoot watching the people watch the fish.  The tank is 75,000 gallons and has dozens of fish.  Haley told me that a diver is in the tank daily for cleaning and feeding.

The heart of the show for me was the central information area with the mementos of the different gangsters.  Ben's letter to his wife written on a Western Airlines plane, the letter from Lansky to Menachem Begin and others were really interesting.  

I loved watching the video of the making of the Godfather movie, but I'd like to view it at home where I'd be a bit more comfortable.

This time, they have gone to having a guest host.  This was the case the first time I came here, but not the second.  Now it's back.

I was brought my iced tea quickly and their was a young bus person who continually refilled the tea for me.The carnival bites are good but what makes them good is the honey mustard for dipping the pieces of sausage.

The goat cheese was a baked piece of cheese in San Marzano tomato sauce with toast pieces to spread the cheese and tomato sauce on.  Both dishes were OK but the best was yet to come.

Each table ordered its own things but with some advice from Philip T. whose review inspired the UYE.

Our table ordered:

Beef soup dumplings
Crystal dumplings
Crispy beef
Beef patty
Cumin lamb
Beef fried rice
Dim sum dumplings

The standout dish for me was the cumin beef.  Complex flavors with good spiciness but it could have been kicked up a notch or two.  The soup dumplings were also very good and the tip of using your chopsticks to coax the dumpling onto your spoon resulted in a filled dumpling with the soup inside.  The wrapper is very thin but it's so worth the effort to get the full dumpling with it's beef filling and beef soup on the inside.

I enjoyed the crispy beef.  The beef fried rice was good as were the dim sum dumplings.  The crystal dumplings fell a little short in flavor and the beef patty--the item I suggested--was my least favorite.  I thought the bread covering the beef was too thick and the ground beef was somewhat greasy.  

As mentioned in some reviews, while they serve dumplings, there is much more on the menu than dumplings and when I go back it will be for one of those dishes than for the dumplings.

Kids of all ages seem to be drawn by those cute animals.  You want to see a panda break dance?  Come see this show!

I would describe the show as a mix of acrobatics, kung fu,  and dance.   There is a whole lot less acrobatics than you see in a Cirque du Soleil show but that's perfectly OK.  There is interaction with the audience at times and the performers of all ages are very talented and have trained well!

A couple of things really got to the theatre person in me.  The ""curtain"" consists of about 35 weighted, cloth tubes onto which different things can be projected.  Before the show, it looks like large stalks of bamboo growing.  Because the curtain is in so many sections, they can raise a small section to reveal one character, lower that section, and raise another section on the other side of the stage.  And the whole thing can be at different levels to add to the staging.

The projections on the back wall and on various objects lowered from above are outstanding!  One is a volcanic eruption that fits into the story somewhat.  Another brings some humor when live performers dance in unison with a large number of terra cotta soldiers.  That was really well done!

The music and the costumes are beautiful. For me, it added to the story but I have always liked classical Asian music of this type.

I ordered the duck and puri which he was making for the weekend too.  He asked me if there was anything else I wanted and I ordered rice which it turned out I didn't need.  There was enough food without it.

In a short time, he called to me as he put the dishes on the shelf of the small kitchen's counter.  A nice bowl of bone in duck pieces and a large dish with two very large puri and some rice.  I had already gotten my Coke at the bar and I was ready to dig in.

The sauce was excellent.  He asked me if it was too hot.  He could tone it down for me if I wanted.  I didn't--it was perfect.  The puri were larger than I expected but they were crispy on the outside and moist inside with a bit of a salty taste.  A nice complement to the duck.

You get your choice of meat/veggie/tofu, and the bowl is loaded with rice, veggies, and aforementioned protein. Since it is served in the hot stone, the rice on the bottom caramelizes and has a nice crispy texture.

We shared a lot of different dishes on our visit here. In addition to the hot stone bowl, we got the omelet appetizer, buckwheat noodle with sashimi, beef bulgolgi, and tofu salad. The omelet appetizer was a large roll of egg and veggies, good but nothing too special. The buckwheat noodle was served cold, in a more al dente texture, covered with spicy red sauce. While I enjoyed the noodles, a sashimi piece I ate had some cartilage or gristle on it, and the dish was so overwhelmingly covered with sauce that it tended to overpower the rest of the ingredients.

The beef bulgolgi was good, but it seemed like a smaller portion that what I'm used to (Or maybe it looked small due to the huge size of the hot stone bowl). The tofu salad was excellent. It had a delicate taste from the silky firm tofu slices, drizzled with a tangy, lightly sweet dressing, with fresh greens.

Tortilla choices include tomato basil, chipotle, spinach, wheat, and regular flour. They offer fillings such as pinto beans, black beans, cheese, rice, lettuce, roasted corn, onions, cilantro, and salsa.

I opted for the barbacoa, with tomato basil tortilla, pinto beans, rice, onions, cheese, guacamole, and spicy salsa. The meat was tender and flavorful. The accompanying ingredients meshed well with the barbacoa. The spicy salsa is indeed quite hot, and packs a punch!

Chef Ming See Woo is turning out amazing dishes with lots of flavor and an abundance of creativity.  Two of us had a tasting of several of her items.  She had determined the menu in advance and we chose a few dishes off the menus.

Items we tried:

Sizzling rice seafood soup
Mustard greens with salty egg and pork soup
Duck quesadilla with goat cheese
Miso sea bass in lettuce cups
Four dim sum dishes--pork bun, pan fried pot sticker, Siu Mai, and har gow.
Honey walnut prawn
Baby back rib with honey plum glaze
Crispy Japanese calamari with five spice, salt and pepper, and jalapeño
Drunken crab with rice wine dipping sauce
Peking duck with vegetables, bao, and duck sauce
Beef tenderloin with spicy Fú sauce and rice cake
Lobster in sake butter sauce
Pepper spice chicken with chili
XO shrimp
Honey walnut shrimp
Garlic egg noodles
White chocolate bread pudding
Chocolate mousse with chocolate pieces and Mandarin orange
Oreo beignets
Crispy banana spring rolls with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce

I cannot point out one dish that was not up to par but there were several standouts.  The XO shrimp were on a different menu that's given to their Asian guests.  The XO shrimp is outstanding and can be ordered anytime.

The lobster is pricey but it is excellent.  Served with the garlic egg noodles, it's an excellent dish.  The sake butter sauce was superb.

The mustard greens soup--also on the Asian menu--was excellent.

The duck quesadilla was an interesting twist that shows why Fú bills itself as a fusion restaurant.  The honey walnut shrimp were outstanding and was the beef tenderloin.  I know I'm listing everything that we tried, but it was all very good.

Finally, the desserts were great.  Oreo beignets with chocolate sauce and crispy banana spring rolls with ice cream.  Chocolate mousse and white chocolate bread pudding.  Desserts don't get much better than this.

Service was excellent.  Serving plates were replaced after each round and we were given fresh, large-sized wet napkins in wrapper to keep our fingers clean from the finger food.  Our cloth napkins were also changed halfway through the meal.

d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g,0,2011-09-07,0,ZnAmq5z_jlOvw9wBsyYNoA,3,"This review is for their Restaurant Week 2011 menu:

Pink Taco has only one meal for RW 2011 - breakfast.  It's a three course meal.  The food was good - nothing special, the service was great, the timing of the courses was awful (I don't believe it was the server's fault.)

A three course breakfast should be like any multi-course meal--brought out as individual plates at appropriate intervals.  This was not the case at the Pink Taco for their RW breakfast.

The first course was a hand made breakfast parfait - coconut granola with yogurt and fresh berries.  It came in a good sized bowl with a good amount of fresh fruit including mango bits, raspberries, blackberries, and kiwi.  I don't believe the granola was coconut granola.  Rather, there were slivers of fresh coconut on top the parfait.  This was quite tasty but nothing exceptional.  The problem came as I was eating the breakfast parfait.  I had eaten about 1/3 of the parfait, when a different server brought me course two - the hot foods of the breakfast sampler.

Course two - a breakfast sampler.  Their RW 2011 menu describes it like this:  Mexican Breakfast Trio - Tasting portions of Huevos Rancheros, Chilaquiles, and Grilled Carne with House made Tortillas and Pappas y Chorizos.  Now I had a large parfait, partially eaten and a large plate of Mexican breakfast tastes.  (See the photo here which shows the parfait off to one side to make room for another plate of food.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/d4qwVw4PcN-_2mK2o1Ro1g?select=tjU_kv_9kwnv8hF2rpcUgQ )  The sampler was tasty especially the chilaquiles.  The carne was just OK.  I really liked the huevos rancheros.

Next service problem - as I was about 3 minutes into course two, the original server brought out course 3 which consisted of 4 sopapillas with a strawberry compote.  Another warm dish that needed to sit until I could get to it.

As for course three, the sopapillas were good.  I didn't taste any honey in the fruit compote as the RW menu stated, but the pillow was just warm and the strawberry was OK.  I ate one sopapilla only.

Thoughts:  someone at Pink Taco needs to give some thought to this menu.  It's way TOO much food for one person.  For the food I got, the price of $20.11 was quite a bargain.  However, since I sent back a good portion of it rather than pig out, it really wasn't a bargain.  And, someone at Pink Taco needs to think out the way they deliver a multi-course meal like this.  If they do this breakfast menu again, I'll bring a friend or three, and we'll split the food and all will be satisfied.  My server, Paulina, was a very pleasant woman.  She refilled my coffee when it needed.

Sitting on the patio was quite nice especially since I was the only person there.  However, they really shouldn't offer patio seating when they're landscapers working on the grounds and using loud and smelly leaf blowers.  It didn't last long, and I did enjoy sitting out and watching some pool critters go by with their bikinis.  Oh to be young again!

This was one of the hardest reviews to write.  Overall I enjoyed my meal, the surroundings, and Paulina.  But, someone at Pink Taco needs to rethink their menu.  A cup of granola, smaller tasting portions, one, maybe two sopapillas and I'd have been a happy camper all around!",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

z9KxcVoe6tQGyB_Zy0Umcg,11,2016-06-04,8,AlKsid-IB93FvH_hO5FLyg,2,"MV Snacks and Sushi is a little eatery hidden in the faded looking Radio Shack plaza behind the Filibertos. The restaurant itself is in an odd little section of the strip mall with a copier business, a hair salon, and a barber shop.

The menu consists of Mexican style snacks, sushi rolls, and desserts. The sushi rolls are similar to Las Vegas rolls in which they are breaded and deep fried with cream cheese.

We walked in and were acknowledged by a curt nod by someone working here, possibly one of the owners? The interior is simple but neatly appointed with IKEA furniture. There seemed to be an air of tension about the room though as the cashier (Who was maybe the other owner?) had to attend to a crying sobbing kid sitting in a chair behind the counter, possibly her daughter? 

The menu is extensive with Spanish and English descriptions of the items. I noticed that although there were a plethora of options for the sushi rolls almost all of them had shrimp in them, were deep fried, and all of them had cream cheese in them. In general, there only seemed to be minor distinguishing characteristics between all the rolls since they all appeared very similar.

We placed an order for carne asada fries, an MV roll, a spicy roll, horchata, and a diet Coke. We checked our receipt after we sat down and noticed we were never rung up for the spicy roll so I went to the cashier again.

I said to her that we had ordered a spicy roll with our meal but it wasn't rung up on the receipt. The cashier then looked at the receipt, parroted what it said and looked at me. I said ""Yes but we wanted another roll, the spicy roll."" With brow furrowed, she then awkwardly acknowledged a ""Sorry about that I only heard the MV roll.""

So I went back to my original request.

""I'd like to order the spicy roll""

""The chili roll?""

(I pointed to the part of the menu board where it said spicy roll) ""The spicy roll, with the chilis in it. The one that says horneados after it.""

Apparently even the cashier has a hard time recognizing the distinguishing characteristics of the menu because she rang up the chili roll when I checked the receipt again after sitting down. Looking at the menu the spicy roll is essentially the chili roll but baked (horneados) with sauce on top. Seeing as that the cashier seemed to have other things on her mind than to actually hear what I was trying to say to her, we decided to keep it simple, let it go and eat it regular style instead of baked like we had wanted.

The carne asada fries ($8) came out first. It was a huge mound of fries, carne asada, pico de gallo, pickled jalapeños and cheese. The starchy lightly crisp fries went well with the earthy deep marinated flavor of the carne asada and the fresh pico de gallo provided a nice temperature and texture difference. The gooey melted cheese was perfect.

The MV roll then was next. The roll seemed to go on forever it was so long! It was lightly breaded and fried, with chicken, beef, bacon, cream cheese, cucumber, avocado, and manchego cheese. The main components of the roll that I could taste were the crunch of the outer breading, the slightly mushy rice, cream cheese, beef and bacon. The chili roll looked similar in size but had shrimp and chilis with cream cheese, avocado and cucumbers in it. I was confused by the shrimp. Did they mean to make them raw or cooked? They tasted like they were halfway between the two states. Kind of odd if you aren't able to cook (Or not cook?) shrimp if it is such a ubiquitous ingredient on your menu, no?

The horchata I had was too sweet for my tastes, but it did help cool down the slight spiciness from the chiles in the chili roll and the spicy heat from the roasted peppers that came with the rolls.

I was sadly disappointed here. I want to help out small businesses as much as I can but unfortunately I wasn't impressed with my experience. Hopefully in time they'll improve on a few things.",22,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I was especially impressed by the chicken soup they brought out.  It was reminiscent of tom yum soup, with complex and robust flavors.  I would say that was the best part of our meal.  The spring rolls were also very good, lots of crunch and flavor.  The actual buffet items were mainly chicken-based, with some pork chops (which were very tasty and tender) to provide a slight mix in the meats.  I think the items sitting in the buffet trays should be covered when not in use since the rice was a bit crunchy from sitting too long in the open air, and the fruits looked withered due to the same reason.  If I went here again, I might order some items a-la-carte rather than trying the buffet since the soup and spring rolls were excellent, while the items in the buffet trays (with the exception of the pork chops) were just OK.",3,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

It is a more difficult hike than it was.  There was one area soon after entering the canyon that was an easy walk on the sandstone to get to the lower level.  Now it's a butt slide you must do carefully.   There was some sign that some have tried to do a walk around but we didn't check to see if there was another way. 

There's a second drop off that is problematic.  The flooding washed some gravel from the base of the sandstone.  We got around this by carefully climbing up some sandstone to bypass the difficult area.  One of our group couldn't do that and she slid down the sandstone and landed on her shoulder.  Just a bit sore.

There are also some new places where boulders have been placed below to make the step down easier.  I'm not sure I'd take friends from out of town on this hike unless another heavy rain changes things again for the better like it did once before.

If you go for the sugar free option, you have your choice of faux sugars (Sweet and Low, Splenda, Equal, etc.) to blend with your ice cream. 

The pear and green tea, while good flavors on their own, were probably not the best option to be mixed together in the smoothie. The smoothie itself had a grainy texture and was mixed with a very rich, full bodied cream which didn't quite mesh with the light, delicate taste of the fruit and tea.

I ordered my steak blue--Victor asked if I wanted it seared 1/3 inch on all sides and I said yes.  The steak was about 2 inches thick and the searing was just perfect for not cooking it too much.  The interior was very rare, exactly the way I like my steak.  The fries were good with a large amount of salt on them.  If you're watching your sodium intake, get something else.

When it came time for dessert, I asked for suggestions.  Victor recommended either the crème brûlée or the chocolate mousse cake.  For the most part, I find crème brûlée to be almost the same from one place to another so I opted for the chocolate mousse cake.  That was the correct choice.  It was creamy, chocolaty, and simply a great way to end the meal.

Service throughout was great!  My iced tea was replaced several times with no need to ask.  The only detriment was the group of five very loud men at the next table.  Because of the narrowness of the restaurant here, I heard the whole conversation including talk of Leonardo DiCaprio and other personalities from an insurance guy.  Go figure.  All this while using four letter words quite liberally.  This was something the restaurant can't control, but it was a drawback from the overall enjoyment of the meal.

Finally, you're paying close to Strip prices for a downtown steakhouse.  It is worth it because the filet was very, very good.",18,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

If you are a fan of Frank Sinatra music, you will really enjoy the show.  Bob Anderson does an excellent job of not merely impersonating Sinatra but seems to become Sinatra during the show. 

Somer of the Sinatra hits he sings are ""Come Fly With Me,"" ""I've Got You Under My Skin,"" ""My Way,"" ""Strangers in the Night"" and ""That's Life.""  That's only a brief list.  The show is 90 minutes in length with some recounting of stories from Sinatra's life with Anderson speaking as if he were Sinatra.

To help Anderson make this transformation to Sinatra, he used Kazuhiro Tsuji, a famous Hollywood makeup artist known for his work in the ""Benjamin Button"" movie and the ape faces in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes.""

Anderson's voice is very much Sinatra so you can just pretend that you are listening to Frank himself on the stage.  Anderson is aided my Vincent Falcone and his orchestra.  The musical backing to the signing is excellent.

If you want to tip one of the ushers, I saw people being seated in the front tables where there's cocktail service.

I have seen every topless revue in Las Vegas and this ranks with the best of them.  The show runs just about one hour and has seven ladies who are very pretty and well endowed.  Endowed may be the wrong word because to me it connotes something received naturally.  It obvious to me that some of these ladies have ""bodies by Corning"" as I like to say and as I like to ogle.

After the ladies make their first appearance, a hostess, Gabriella, comes out and sings with a great voice.  She really belts it out.  Some of the other parts of the show are a wonderful pole dance done to Michael Bublé's version of ""Feeling Good."" 

One of my favorite parts of the show was the longer routine with the bathtub.  Sexy, erotic, and lovely are good words to describe this segment.  There's also a woman who does a terrific job with the silks.  She has the strength of any Cirque du Soleil performer.  It's amazing what she can accomplish in the small venue of the Shimmer with the low ceiling.  

There are other good acts but you should see the show to find out and enjoy for yourself.  The show is at 10:30 PM.

I stopped in yesterday for the first time and I got two large pho for takeout.  One was beef meatball pho and the other was everything--rare steak, flank, meatball, tripe, brisket, and tendon.

The soups were packed in two containers both having the meatballs.  In other boxes, there was the other 5 meats for my combo and scallions, cilantro, and sliced onion.  In a separate bag was a large amount of bean sprouts, some sliced jalapeños, and spicy Thai basil.  There was another box that had the two spring rolls I ordered.

While waiting for my take out, the owner gave me a glass of iced tea to enjoy while I sat there.  I also took the time to walk around and take some photos.  It's a very pleasant restaurant.  Everyone was very nice.

The pho was very good.  The broth was good and the meats were good, too.  The thing I learned from take out is to reheat the soup when you get home and get it back to scalding hot and then divide the portions and add your vegetables.  That would more closely match the restaurant version.

I'll be going back to try some of their other Vietnamese food and I'll definitely be back for some pho!",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Much of the tour consists of sitting on the bus in the shade of some buildings while the tour director describes mob activities and shows photos and video on the flat panel at the front of the bus.  The first talk was about 15 minutes as we sat in the shade of the buildings west of the Royal Resort.  We then took a circuitous route down Convention Center Drive, made a left on Paradise, went to Sahara where we made a right, turned right on Joe W. Brown and then parked in the shade of the Las Vegas Hilton near its Sports Book entrance.  From there we went back down Joe W. to karen to Maryland to Sahara to Tony Roma's where Frank Rosenthal survived a car bombing attempt on October 4, 1982.  See what I mean about how the ""tour"" goes.  For a local, it was awful to see the roundabout way we were going.  As a tourist, I might not have noticed.

The material offered during the tour is excellent.  There just isn't enough to see on the tour.  The only place we got out of the bus and toured anything was the last place, the Flamingo Hotel, where we walked to Benjamin ""Bugsy"" Siegel's Garden.

I got there a little after 6 PM and I found out that Happy Hour was until 7 PM.  I ordered the Notorious P.I.G. which is a hot dog with bacon, pickled jalapeño rounds, and horseradish macaroni and cheese all on a hot dog bun.  It was quite good.  The hot dog was grilled and the bacon and jalapeño slices added to the flavor.  I didn't taste much horseradish in the mac and cheese.  I was hoping for a kick, but it just wasn't there.  Along with Notorious P.I.G., I ordered a side of fries.  These were great!  Nicely seasoned with just the right amount of salt.  Very flavorful.

Of course, I couldn't leave without dessert so I ordered their chocolate crunch which is about a 2 inch by 1 1/2 inch round of chocolate mousse that has been covered with melted chocolate and then hardened.  You crack through the chocolate exterior--the crunch--to get to the mousse inside.  It was very good.  There was some mango syrup on the plate and a few slices of fresh strawberry.  A great ending to the meal.

Service was good.  My server, Eddie, was around to refill my iced tea several times and was very helpful.  The place is relatively small.  When I come back, I'll opt for a high top table.

I was excited to hear that this place in the Chandler mall sold rolled ice cream AND egg waffles! The space is where Popcornopolis used to be, near the food court. There are a few varieties of ice cream to choose from such as coffee, chocolate, Thai tea and green tea. I got the #6, a green tea ice cream that was supposed to come with blueberries but they had run out of them for the night so I had to substitute blackberries and raspberries. There was a fairly steady line but the orders came out pretty quickly.

The ice cream was smooth and creamy and I could definitely taste the green tea. I was disappointed that for $7 they only gave me 3 berries to go with the whipped cream on top which was not enough to cover the top of each single roll. For that price I was expecting more, especially since I can get a better variety and volume of ice cream at other ice cream shops. I guess part of the cost is the novelty of the whole thing along with  the cost of the anti-griddle and labor costs.

The egg waffles were decent. They were light and crispy on top but soft on the bottom. The texture inside the waffle was more dense and chewy than at other places I've had them, similar to the texture of mochi.

I might go here again for the egg waffles but I'll probably go elsewhere for my ice cream fix for that price point.",18,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I recently got a gift certificate for Rosemary's as a result of an NPR donation so off I was to try it out.  I had spoken to a friend who's been here with his wife several times, and I decided to sit where he suggested.  When I arrived about 15 minutes early, I requested a seat at the rear food bar.  There is a counter that looks directly into the cooking area with the two grills and you can watch Leonard and Jason do their magic--along with the rest.

I decided to do the 5 course tasting menu.  Smart idea--it was great.  I had two amuse-bouche--an eggplant caviar on a fried wonton and sauteed mushrooms.  

The courses:

First:  Duo of Tartars - Beef and salmon tartars.  The beef tartar was on a soft boiled egg, part on each egg half.  Very nice plating.

Second:  Pan seared pompano on a bed of sauteed spinach.  This was the first time I had pompano and I was pleased with the taste of the pompano and I liked it a lot.

Third:  Texas BBQ shrimp with Maytag blue cheese slaw.  Outstanding!  The combination of BBQ sauce with the blue cheese and slaw was amazing!

Fourth:  Rack of Lamb over sauteed kale.  Another winner!  Perfect rare cooking for the lamb and very tasty.  I wanted to gnaw on the bones.

Fifth:  Dessert - this was a trio of desserts - creme brulee, chocolate cake, and a beer float.  Since I had no alcohol, the server asked if I'd want root beer instead of the lambic beer they use and I chose the root beer.  The trio was quite tasty, especially the creme brulee.

After dessert, I was brought some mignardises, a brownie,  a lemon square, and a peanut butter cookie.

Service was impeccable.  Before my iced tea was finished, the server brought me a fresh glass when I had less than 1/3 left.  He asked me again later if I need another replacement and he was there in a few moments.

Some of my friends from Yelp have mentioned the saltiness of some things.  I noticed that last night, but as a person to loves salt, it was not an issue for me.  You might want to be aware of this in advance.

I have to say a word about my seating.  SInce I dined alone, this was just perfect.  I enjoyed watching the kitchen staff do their thing and it was great fun to watch the ballet of grilling, searing, sauteeing, and plating that took place before me.  Even if you were there with a significant other, it would be a good place to sit but not for a romantic dinner.

I was seated quickly and looked over the menu.  My server, Kayla, brought me iced tea quickly and then I ordered.

I got the El Caliente burger.  The menu describes it this way:  Beef Patty Topped w/ Pepper Jack Cheese, Pickled Jalapeno, Avocado, Pork Chicharrones & Tequila-Cilantro Mayo.  I asked for the burger to be cooked rare and it came out just that way.  Score.

There's a lot going on with the burger.  While there is some spiciness from the jalapeño, que no es real caliente.  This is something that anyone can eat unless they have no tolerance at all for anything that has the slightest spiciness.

The chicharrones with the cheese and soft meat was a nice combination of textures. The burger was very juicy and I had to use my napkin several times to keep from getting juices from fingers to clothes.  The fries were good.  They didn't need salt which was good because there were no salt nor pepper shakers in sight.

I passed on dessert because it was more of a share kind of thing and I didn't want four brownies, two dips of ice cream and all the other accouterments that went with the dessert I was thinking of ordering.

Service was good.  I felt sorry for Kayla because access to the table I was at was partially blocked by a stroller from the family at the next table./  Their kids were very good and it was the birthday of one of them and the staff brought him a milkshake with a candle.

The menu has a limited but delicious selection of soul food as well as a few varieties of their signature banana pudding. I had the breaded chicken wings with collard greens and tip potatoes, and finished my meal with some banana split banana pudding.

Our server informed me that the chicken wings are made fresh and would take 25 minutes to make. Well, good things come to those that wait I figured! We did get some sweet, soft dinner rolls to start with. The sides came next. I liked the deep earthy flavor of the collard greens. It was such a concentrated flavor I could only take a few bites at a time though. I loved the tip potatoes. They had a spicy seasoning and even though it had what looked like Kraft cheese singles melted on top it actually was a good combo with the potato chunks.

The chicken wings came out piping hot, super juicy and tender. I loved the crispy breaded skin. It was perfectly seasoned and had just the right amount of crispness and chew.

On to dessert! The banana pudding was amazing! It isn't your typical idea of pudding. This pudding was very light and whipped, kind of like a mix between pudding and whipped cream. It was served with Nilla wafers, strawberries, fresh banana slices, chopped nuts, chocolate sauce, pineapple, and whipped cream with a cherry on top! I loved all the elements together except for the hard, dry Nilla wafers which distracted from the other textures for me. Maybe if they were softer (Lightly soaked in something perhaps) they would go better with the rest of the dessert.

When brought to the attention of our captain, she condescendingly stated that she always tells everyone that there is an additional charge for the caviar course--that it's not one of the 7 courses.  Well, this time she didn't, but she was sure she was right.  The online menu has subsequently been changed so there's little chance for confusion.

The question I had when I was eating this burger was, do I really need this stuffed? What is the benefit to having a stuffed burger other than for the sheer novelty? Generally, I think the stuffed idea works to keep the filling ingredients juicy and keeps everything from squeezing out the sides.

I have come to like this drink a lot and look forward to Peruvian restaurants to enjoy more.  With the drink, my server brought a complimentary small bowl of cancha, the first time I've gotten this at any of the Peruvian places to which I've been.  They're salty and nicely crunchy and they go so well with the chicha morada.  

My server asked me if I was familiar with Peruvian food and she had a tablet with photos that you could scroll through and pick out dishes.  I told her I knew what I wanted just as she was pressing the lomo saltado image.  

In a short time, she brought the dish to me along with three sauces, green and red aji (both are spicy hot--test before you overdo something.  I preferred the green aji.  Neither one was too hot for me.  I tasted the white, mayo-based sauce and it was too mild.  

The lomo saltado was very good.  The beef was tender and the vegetables with the beef were not cooked too much.  The onion and pepper slices had crunch to them and the tomatoes were just warmed through.  The rice was flavorful--the fries were standard.  

When my server asked me about dessert, she said all they had were alfajores and flan.  I've had enough flan so I ordered an alfajor.  She informed me they only sell them in boxes of eight.  I ordered the box knowing I could have one or two--or maybe three--and I could take the rest home.  When she brought the plastic box, I asked if they were made in house as they were different from the larger ones I've had before.  She said they were indeed made there.

Unfortunately it was more of an open faced pita since it didn't close all the way which made it awkward to eat with round falafel patties in it. Quite a few times the falafel rolled out of my pita and onto my table, with or without sauce on it! The sauce itself was creamy but didn't have a lot of flavor. 

The fries were a huge amount which I appreciated. Service was friendly and it didn't take too long for my wrap to be made. If I'm in the area I'd probably stop by to try something else if I'm in the mood for Middle Eastern cuisine.",6,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I had been here once before many years ago, and I remembered it as being a good, solid place.  It's pretty much the same now.

Among some of the things I tires, the Chinese broccoli with lots of garlic was outstanding.  The BBQ chicken pizza was good, too.  The prime rib was standard and was much of the other things I tried from the buffet.  There were no gourmet dishes but there was nothing that was bad.

They have free wine and beer with dinner which may be a plus for some people.  One of my friends did not care for the wine she got but she and her husband were pleased with the buffet also,

I think the place it was lacking was at the dessert area.  I ended up with two chocolate cakes and a raspberry cake.  The two raspberry and square chocolate cakes were OK but the chocolate cake cut like a pie wedge was outstanding!  It was quite rich--almost decadent.

I'd recommend this place for someone who's staying at Mandalay Bay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.  There are better buffet options available on the Strip but at a few dollars more for the most part.",4,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

There are 2 trees, nowhere near the benches, so if you are sitting on a bench there won't be any shade for you.  One of the metal bench seats was bent at a weird angle, not sure how that happened?  There is one station that is supposed to dispense poop bags, but there weren't any bags available.   Since they do not replenish the poop bags, there was an accumulation of dog material when I went.  There is one fountain for water, at dog and human level.   

This park is best suited for larger dogs, because the side of the fence that borders an apartment parking lot has wide bars that a very small dog could slip through.  The bars also have some areas that aren't grated underneath, so that there is space under them.  An adventurous small dog could slip under them if you're not careful.  I saw my small little dog thinking through the process of trying to get through and make an escape, but good thing he's a little too wide for those bars!

Red chili chicken skewer
Pork with garlic sauce
Beef with crispy rice crust
Guess Guess shrimp
Sautéed wild yam
Toothpick lamb with cumin
Sutéed eggplant
Dip fried chicken cube
Tan Tan Noodles
Dry stir fried pigs intestine
Rice

The tastes of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province famous for its spicy food with lots of chilis, is well represented with this restaurant in Chinatown.  We divided the items we wanted into two groups of 5 dishes and had the meal courses in those two groups.

The milder dishes came first with the red chilis being very evident in the second 5 dishes which rounded out the meal.  Note that the menu says red chili chicken skewer, but it has more than chicken.  There are chicken feet, lotus, fungus, and chicken gizzards in a cold broth.  Very good.  The Guess Guess shrimp was an absolute winner!  Shrimp eaten with shells on sitting on top of a mound of French fries.  Who would have thought?  It is so good!

The toothpick lamb with cumin was good as was the beef with crispy rice crust.  One of the standout dishes was the dry stir fried pig intestine.  So good.  

This is a place where a dish is enough for two people to share so it's best if you go here with a number of people to share and try more dishes.

Service was very good with plenty of refills of our water jugs and the way that they divided the meal into the two major courses and asked before beginning the second half.  Since our conductor had written down the dishes, it was easier to order and to have it coursed.",20,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The house is a marvel to behold, an experiment of sorts, of what he could accomplish in what was still an untamed land. Every piece of the house and property itself was carefully crafted, with great thought put into each aspect of the living spaces. The name itself Taliesin (Pronounced Tally-ess-in) is an homage to a childhood Welsh story he had heard way back when. 

The tour was informative and our guide Phil B. provided excellent and entertaining commentary on the building of Taliesin West and Frank Lloyd Wright's life. Each part of the tour revealed another innovative and unique aspect of this house, and the strengths and weaknesses of the designs. For instance, the canvas covers for the ceilings provide a perfect amount of light to show through, but they do require more maintenance, especially when it rains. 

The house is still a living, breathing space for the past, present, and future. The last few remaining students from Frank Lloyd Wright's original architectural school live here (They are in their 90s), tours highlight the depth and creativity of the artist's vision which is still a work of timeless art, and it is still an educational  experience for those that are starting their architectural career (Right now they offer masters programs). 

We took the 90 minute Insights tour which was $32 per person online ($36 at the door) which I thoroughly enjoyed. About half the time was spent outdoors admiring the integration of desert and nature into the manmade space, the Asian influenced touches, and in general all the beautiful features that made this space a lovely place to call your home. The indoor area was equally amazing, as we toured bedrooms, entertainment areas, a storage/movie room, and even a cabaret room made below ground.

The price of admission was worth every penny and you get a wonderful glimpse into the talented mind of Frank Lloyd Wright. Definitely a great way to spend a day in Scottsdale.",16,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

They also offer more vegetarian options.  This is the 3rd day since their opening, and it was decently busy for a Thursday night.

The interior is pretty nice, and has various bicycle-themed accoutrements, such as a pair of silver owls made out of bicycle parts.  The bar and dining area is very spacious, and TVs line the walls.  There is a patio area which overlooks the gorgeous lake area outside, which I will definitely have to take advantage of once the weather is nicer!

They offer a wide range of beers available (20+ on the menu), as well as iced tea and soda.  A nice thing about their iced tea is they offer Stevia in their sweetener baskets.  

Once we were seated, we were handed menus.  Despite it being just their third day since the grand opening, my menu was already splattered, sticky, and had a large tear on the side.

It had fresh vegetables such as red bell pepper and eggplant in it, as well as fresh basil and mozzarella.  It had a sweet balsamic vinegar sauce with it.  As a whole, it did taste a little bland (Maybe it needed some more of the balsamic?) and the eggplant was tough and bitter.  I tried the carver burger, which I liked a lot better.  It was a sizable meal, with juicy, perfectly cooked to order meat, and very flavorful ingredients. The only real negative for my husband was that he felt the burger needed some more seasoning to bring out the flavor of the beef more. We both had sweet potato fries as a side, although you can also get sides such as salad, soup, or waffle fries with your order.  The sweet potato fries were awesome.  They were light, crispy, with just the right amount of seasoning.

He has developed a wonderful way of asking a few questions of some audience members, and with his quick wit, turning these answers into funny comments that engage the entire audience.  All is in good fun--well except for the time the girl got a cell phone call during a performance.

Burke is introduced as the world's only psychic comedian and his act weaves comedy and illusions.  There is a good amount of audience participation and there is much laughter.

Without giving anything away, I would assume that Burke gets yearly tetanus shots and has a supply of bandages nearby during each performance.  

I have seen this show several times, and although some of the things are the same, I always laugh with the audience seeing it for the first time, and I come away with a big smile because the one hour show has been so much fun!

The showroom is small and it lends itself to Burke's performance quite nicely.  The showroom is on the second floor of Fitzgerald's Hotel and Casino on ""Freakmont Street.""

Our iced tea was brought quickly and a basket with hush puppies and two rolls was brought.  The butter for me was awful.  It was honey butter.  Maybe it's a southern thing.  I like salted butter and this was just too sweet for me.  It was also hard as a rock from being kept in a very cold refrigerator/freezer another hang up I have.

Our meals came and I totally enjoyed the alligator.  If I got it again, I'd definitely get half of each.  It really is good.

uZd7UVMib1EYUFFbfWkGdw,4,2010-12-19,3,QJ4bhsIVlJR62BqzGJg8wQ,4,"This is a moderately strenuous hike because of the nearly 1,200 foot elevation gain.  The hike is approximately 6.5 miles round trip if you go to both peaks.  

The trailhead is along US Highway 93.  As you approach Boulder City, turn left the way you'd go to Hoover Dam.  After you start down the hill past Industrial Road, watch for a sign on the left that says River Mountains Trail parking.  It's just before the entrance to the St. Jude's Ranch for Children.  There is ample parking here.

From the parking area, walk behind the interpretive marker and the trail goes between the wall of an area of houses on the left and a concrete drainage ditch on the right.  From there, the trail is fairly easy to follow as it's well defined.  Follow the signs for the trail.  There are side trails that are mountain bike trails so watch for the hiking only trail markers.  The first part of the trail meanders around a bit and goes up and down until it works its way around and into a wash that comes down from the saddle between the two peaks.  The saddle is the first goal.

As you hike toward the saddle, the trail becomes a series of switchbacks to make getting to the top easier.  Please DO NOT CUT the switchbacks.  This damages the trail and when rain comes, wash outs are more likely.  You'll also be trampling some native plants so stay on trail.

Turn left at the saddle and keep heading up.  There's still a bit more to go.  After a few more switchbacks, you'll come to a road--a road you could have driven up, but that would defeat the whole purpose of hiking, no?  This road is used to get to the antenna array at the top of Red Mountain.  It's also used to take those who are doing the Bootleg Canyon flight lines near the launching area for the first flight.  When you reach this road, you have a stunning view of Las Vegas and the Spring Mountains on the west side of the valley.  You walk a short distance along the road and you'll see the trail to Red Mountain continue on your left.

Follow the trail as it goes higher.  It's a bit rocky and there is one spot that has some loose gravel.  After a short time, you do reach the Red Mountain area and you see the antenna array you've probably seen many times driving to/from Hoover Dam.  The actual peak for Red Mountain has a stake and you can go there if you want to be at the topmost point.  In this area, you can see the first flight for the Bootleg Canyon Flight Lines, Lake Mead, The Eldorado Valley with its two solar plants, and of course, Las Vegas.  It's a wonderful place.  If you're lucky, you'll be here when a group does the flight.  You can also see the mountain bike trails that make up the Bootleg Canyon  
trails.  It's interesting to see these people riding down the steep slopes.

Now for the bad news, Black Mountain is on the opposite side of the saddle.  You can see the trail you need to follow from Red Mountain.  If you've had enough, just return to your car.  It's only about 3 miles away.  If you're going to Black Mountain or your car, you need to head back the way you came passing the dirt road and looking carefully watching for when the trail to the saddle goes off the dirt road to the right.

When you get back to the saddle, continue straight ahead on the trail if you're going to Black Mountain or make a right if you're going back to the car now.  

The trail goes about 1/2 mile to Black Mountain.  It is very well defined and you hike on volcanic rock.  That's what makes Black Mountain its color.  At the top of Black Mountain, there's a bench and several interpretive markers explaining the geology of the Las Vegas Valley.  It's a good place to have a snack and enjoy the view.

Follow your tracks back to the saddle and then descend the switchbacks.  They're so much nicer now that you're going downhill.  Before you know it, you'll be back to your car.  There is a picnic table at the parking area, so you can have an après hike lunch.  We call it Guinness time!

The order was brought in a timely manner.  The steak was nicely done and sliced thin and was accompanied by the pesto/basil thick spaghetti.  The hot green Peruvian sauce was great!  I almost put the bottle in my pocket to take with me.  The lighter sauce tasted good but had no kick.  The fried plantains were very good.  I've always liked them andPeru Chicken did not let me down.

The picarones for dessert were wonderful--too big of an order for one--but I don't like to waste food so I finished the whole amount.  Picarones are pumpkin and sweet potato doughnuts served with drizzled chancaca, a South American sweet sauce made with raw sugar and honey.  The picarones had been drizzled with the chancaca and there was much left at the bottom to dip the remaining pieces.

Service was very pleasant.  This is a mom and pop operation and they were both very pleasant.  This is a must return place if only for some more tallarin verde!",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
TscyJToVcStsohgRG9qM7g,6,2014-10-06,1,WVC2B-rxcJFxOQZMK-Mxdw,5,"The Onyx Theatre is now one of the most used venues in the city.  There is always something going on.  Saturday night, I saw Sondheim's Merrily We Roll Along.  Before that was The Importance of Being Earnest.  The venue has also been the site for Anton Chekov's Cherry Orchard of the Living Dead.  After Merrily, there will be two weekends of Alfred Hitchcock's Rope.  

As you can see, the venue is constantly a spot for good entertainment produced by Off Strip Productions and other theatre groups that don't have a permanent home.

The theatre seats just under 100 people so it's an intimate showroom.

I recommend checking the Onyx website and picking one of their shows.  You'll be hooked.",6,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Much thanks to Lindsey for hosting this amazing event that included smooth, refreshing gelato, various baked goods such as croissants and English muffins, and delicious sweets such as cupcakes, brownies, cookies, and small cake bites. Everything was freshly made from scratch. Even the marshmallow fluff in the fluffernutter cake was made on site! My favorites were the cake bites with the blood orange gelatin topping, the buttery, flaky croissants, and quite possibly the best English muffins I've ever had! These large, soft, pillowy savory treats were made fresh on the griddle by one of the talented chefs here.

Drinks included pink bubbly champagne, water, and something in a heated container (Coffee? Tea?). The goody bags after the event were equally amazing, as they included one of LGO's lovely English muffins, 3 different cookies, a sample of granola from Grateful Spoon Gelato, and a voucher for the LGO bake shop! 

Although parking at LGO is always a bit of a difficult process, it was relatively painless using the valets around the corner, who were very friendly and efficient.

We didn't feel like destroying the kitchen, plus I had a gift card so we made reservations to The Keg. We were escorted to a comfy booth in the back (My seat did have a noticeable large tear in it exactly where you would sit, minor point but you might want to get it reupholstered : ) ). I had the Thanksgiving meal, a three-course of Caesar salad, sliced turkey plate with mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce, steamed vegetables, and a cheesecake with pumpkin spice drizzle. I also tried some lobster and the prime rib. 

The Thanksgiving meal was decent, and admittedly their strong suit isn't poultry. The stuffing was a bit mushy, the turkey was tender, but not really inspiring any ""wow"" factor. I did like the cranberry sauce since it wasn't overloaded with sugar like the stuff in the Ocean Spray can is. The mashed potatoes and veggies were very basic, nothing too awe inspiring.

The steak and seafood were a lot better. The prime rib had good flavor, and was a good portion for the price. It's no Durant's prime rib in terms of tenderness, but then again you aren't paying Durant's prices :). The lobster I had was delicious, full of flavor, cooked just right. The cheesecake was pretty basic, and the crust tasted more like sugar than graham cracker.

Service was great and a manager even stopped by each table to make sure everyone was having a good experience here. 

Overall, it's a good option if you're in Tempe and want steak or seafood.",6,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I stopped here for breakfast yesterday and I was glad I did.  I had been going to eat at the Huntridge, but the food operation there is permanently closed I was told.  So, off to Tiffany's for me.

I had the Spanish Omelette.  A nice omelette with jalapeño slices, green pepper, cubed tomato with cheese on top.  Accompanying that  was a generous portion of home fries and rye toast.  I added some Tabasco my server brought before bringing my breakfast, and I had a spicy and flavorful omelette.

While sitting there sipping my coffee, I noticed a sign on the wall from 2005 noting the place would be closed for a couple of weeks for the shooting of a movie.  The sign had Robert Duvall's autograph.  I asked the server what the movie was and she told me it was ""Lucky You.""  I Googled and saw it was a movie with a poker playing plot that had been shot on location in Las Vegas.  Well I knew that having breakfast at Tiffany's was not going to be the movie thing, but it turned out to be a different movie.

I'm glad I stopped in.  It's good to support a local business!

I had been to their old location a few times but somehow had always overlooked the new place tucked in the corner of Village Square even though I'm here for movies often.

We were seated promptly, brought our iced teas, and given plenty of time to look over the lunch menu.  We were also brought chips and salsa and refried beans.  The salsa was very good with a very nice tang to it.

My wife ordered the pollo ala Mexicana and I ordered thew chicharrones with nopales.  Both dishes were very good.  Each was served with refried beans and a small salad.  I wish the nopales were fresh but they were pickled and mixed in with the chicharrones.  

We were looking at the dessert menu when a server brought us some fried tortillas dipped in cinnamon and sugar with a dollop of whipped cream and cherry and some chocolate syrup.  There was no need to order dessert.  This was just the small kind of ending we were looking for.

Service was excellent!  Our iced teas never wanted for refills and the food is good.  I like the layout of the restaurant and it's larger than it appears from the outside.

After looking over the menu, I told the waitress I wanted a cup of hot and sour soup and an order of braised pork belly with preserved vegetables.  She gave me an odd look and then said, ""Those are dried vegetables.  They're not fresh vegetables.""  My response was, ""Yes?""  She then told me again they were not fresh vegetables and she added, ""I don't think you'll like that.  You should order something else.  We have fish and...."" and she gestured to other items on the separate, non-main menu.  I just got profiled because I'm not Asian.  I won't like it!!  I don't think she'll like this 1 star review!!!!

I looked over the menu some more and opted for the curry chicken.  In a short time, the curry chicken was brought.  Note that since I didn't say hot and sour soup a second time, it was left off the order.  In a few seconds, she brought the small bowl of rice.

They use plastic chopsticks and I have a difficult time with heavily sauced Chinese food and plastic.  I should have gone to the car where I always keep a pair of wooden chopsticks but I put the plastic ones down and started using my fork.  The server saw this and asked, ""Do you want a spoon?""  My answer was a quiet but firm, ""No!""  In a few moments she came to the table with a small plastic spoon that looked like a child's spoon.

The chicken was OK.  The sauce was heavy.  There should be more curry flavor.  This was my fourth time here (and last) and I have always gotten Singapore noodles and after the first time I've had to stress heavy on the curry.  That was my mistake this time.

I finished my meal, paid, crossed off the line for tip, signed the charge, and left.

The burger bar has a plethora of toppings to choose from after you get your burger. Such options include lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, onion, mustard, ketchup, and relish. 

The burger was quite tasty, with a pleasant grilled flavor from both beef and the green chile. The green chiles I had were pretty mild, so if you want to kick up the heat, add some jalapenos from the burger bar.

We have a membership to the Botanical Gardens and decided to get tickets to this event since we would get discounted admission and we could go on a members-only night which we theoretically thought would mean less people would be attending.

We were wrong.

We got here later on in the evening, around 6:30ish, about an hour after the event was officially open. The entrance to the parking lot stated that the event was totally sold out so there were no tickets available at the door. We hunted for parking and circled around and around... And around and around... Fortunately they had many parking attendants here that helped steer us to the most recently open lots. Since all the regular parking and overflow parking lots were full, they set aside a dirt plot for the ""overflow of the overflow"" parking which is where we ended up. Despite the arduous parking situation, it wasn't too bad of a walk to the entrance to the gardens.

There were several paths to walk down, and initially there was a huge group of people herding themselves down one particular path which made it annoyingly claustrophobic despite the open air environment. Eventually the crowd eased up though and we could walk around with no crowding issues. Since it took us so long to find parking we only had maybe 30 minutes to look around before heading to Gertrude's for our dinner reservation. We did walk around more after dinner though since the event is open until 9:30. I'd say plan for at least 1.5-2 hours of walking around and admiring the luminarias. Plan for more time if you want to stop and enjoy some of the live music or indulge in a cocktail.

Also plan for it being cold! I wore multiple layers, including a scarf which helped a lot. 

In addition to live music, there were a few areas where they were selling cocktails, and a dinner buffet setup. 

It was a chilly but fun night.

2016 prices:
-Members: $25 per person (They also had a discount code for an additional $5 off for members this year if you bought tickets before Oct. 31)

Our server, Mariah, was there quickly with menus, took our drink orders, and brought us our iced teas quickly.  She answered the questions we had about items we were considering.

We order two sushi rolls and two side dishes.  The sushi rolls were the standard California roll and a Lava Lover roll which the menu describes as a spicy tuna cucumber roll topped w/ cajun ahi, chili paste & garlic ponzu.  Both rolls were good.  The more interesting of the two was the Lava Lovers roll.  It was not very spicy and carried just a small kick--wasabi being a good addition to the heat for me.

The two sides were mochiko chicken and teriyaki beef.  This was only the second time I had mochiko chicken and I liked it better than the first time I had it elsewhere.  There was not sweet sauce on the chicken.  Rather, it was served plain which was good.  The teriyaki beef was good with a topping of sesame seed for decoration and a small amount of flavor.

We couldn't leave without some dessert.  My friend ordered mango mochi and I got the malassada sundae.  My sundae was very good.  The malassada and the ice cream may have been overkill calorie wise, but ti was very tasty!

I had a reservation for 6:30 and I was promptly seated in an almost empty restaurant.  There was one table occupied and one person eating at the seafood bar.  I had looked at the menu online, but I took some time looking there, changing my mind, and then ordering.  I was brought a bread basket, served water, and brought an iced tea quickly.

I ordered a jumbo lump crabmeat cocktail, the miso Chilean sea bass, and the 7 layer chocolate cake for dessert.  The lump crabmeat was the best part of the meal.  The crab was tasty and the cocktail sauce they brought had extra horseradish to mix in.  I really enjoyed this appetizer.

The sea bass was disappointing.  It was on the menu under their ""House Signatures"" section of the menu.  It's described as sea bass with a house made miso glaze.  What I got was more of a miso gravy than glaze and it wasn't appealing.  When I tasted it, I wished I had ordered the plain sea bass.  The sea bass was moist and very hot (temperature).  The entrée comes with two sides and I chose cole slaw and garlic fries.  The fires were good but they had absolutely no taste of garlic.  The cole slaw was OK.

When it came to dessert, I had asked my server if the cobbler was warmed.  He said yes.  I asked him if it was already warm and he said no.  I ordered the cobbler and asked that it not be warmed.  About 3 minutes later, he came back and said they ran out of cobbler.  I opted for the 7 layer chocolate cake.  I wonder if they really were out or if the cobbler was indeed kept warm and he didn't want to tell me that.

Service was spotty during the night.  Empty Sweet 'n Low packets were not removed from the table until I put them in the empty crab cocktail glass.  Iced tea wasn't refilled as quickly as many restaurants of lesser cost, and the table was not properly bussed.  The waiter didn't remove the bread basket and bread plate before he brought the dessert.  After I had taken a few bites of the cake, a bus person came by and removed those items.

And then there's the Groupon.  The fine print says not valid with any other..... including Total Rewards.  That means, they don't give you the TR pricing.  It's not that much of a loss to the customer and it shouldn't be that big of a deal for Búzios either.  $1 more for the appetizer, $3 more for the sea bass, and $1 more for dessert.  You got $5 more out of me for using a Groupon.  Was it worth it to you?  Also, the Groupon states that an 18% service fee (note they can't say gratuity anymore because of IRS rules) will be applied to the bill prior to discount.  I somewhat understand this, but my server got cheated a bit because I normally do 20%.  Not that much difference but hey, I'm getting back part of the TR pricing I couldn't have.  

Finally, reservations were made through Open Table.  At any other restaurant, as soon as I check in, Open Table says I have 100 points.  As of this afternoon, my Open Table points are ""pending"".

This apparently is the way Búzios operates.  Don't be business friendly with the customer.  Instead, challenge them and nickel and dime them every step of the way.  Groupons normally are sold by new companies to drive traffic and make a name.  The other reason is to help failing places.  Since the Búzios Groupon is an ongoing seller, I can only imagine that they're struggling to stay alive.

Blanco is what you'd expect of a Mexican restaurant at the Biltmore: stepped up versions of your typical favorites such as burritos, enchiladas, and tacos of course :). We started with the ceviche ($13). It was presented beautifully with a lot of seafood (lump crab and shrimp) and vegetables in a delightful tangy citrus marinade. There were a lot of very roughly chopped, large chunks of vegetables such as cucumber and celery in it though which made it hard to eat with tortilla chips without cutting them into smaller pieces. The largest piece I saw was a 2 inch section of celery. They definitely like everything large and chunky in that ceviche!

I ordered the chicken mole which had a lovely kaleidoscope of colors on my plate from the earthy colored chicken, reddish Spanish rice, and multicolored vegetables topping the plate. The chicken was tender but there were a few bits of gristle in some bites I took, and the mole sauce was good but very sweet compared to other versions I've tried.

I'll be back to serve myself and try one of the Dole Whip floats.",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
uuGlYAIvYAX1q1KhpY6dtA,1,2012-10-31,0,P4GNjVqZhBYj1WoDOeuDwQ,3,"I wanted to try Brand after reading the good reviews on Yelp.  The food and the service was good, but it didn't make it to four stars.

I ordered the Brooklyn filet, a 12 ounce, bone-in filet.  I ordered it black and blue.  I opted for the loaded baked potato as my server suggested it was more of a single diner option for a side than some of the others which are almost large enough to be shared.  The baker had butter, sour cream, cheese, and bacon.  

For dessert, I got the banana s'mores, a unique dessert of a banana with with some chocolate and toasted miniature marshmallows on top of the baked banana.  With the banana came 3 dishes, one with some extra chocolate bits, one with vanilla ice cream, and one with a sauce of peanut butter with coconut.  There were also some graham crackers to dip or just eat with the other things.

The food was good.  The filet was grilled nicely and done the way I requested.  The dessert was quite creative and something you don't see anywhere else. 

Service was excellent.  Iced tea was refilled promptly, my server came by several times to see if I needed anything, and they passed the dead sweetener packet test with flying colors!

So why 3 stars.  One, they had no bread service.  Really?  At these prices you can't do bread.  I also am not fond of the openness of the restaurant to the casino.  When I'm at a casino steakhouse, I want to be cut off from the sights and sounds of the casino.  Here, I had a view of several flat screens at the blackjack pits and i could see lots of flashing slot lights.  Finally, there really wasn't anything special about the food.  The s'mores dessert was special but the rest was OK.  Hence the 3 stars.  It's not a place to which I'd come back.",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The roaring tiger came out in a sizzling platter. The sizzle and smell was amazing! The beef was marinated well. The Thai boat noodle soup was a large portion, with tender beef, rice noodles, and a lovely tasting broth. 

Service was uneven as we had attentive service initially, but then the waiter forgot to refill drinks and check up on us as the meal progressed.

I had a reservation for 5 PM to assure plenty of time to eat and relax before the 7 PM show.  I was taken to a two top at the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains.

I looked at the menu and my server came and asked about water/other beverages and I ordered my standard iced tea which was quickly brought to the table.  I looked over the menu some more and the server gave me some recommendations.  I decided to order one cold shared plate and one warm shared plate as the server (and some reviews) point out that the shared plates aren't that large.

I got the Big eye tuna pizza and the tempura Alaskan king crab.  These were two recommendations from the server and he pointed out that the tempura crab had been on the Best Thing I Ever Ate Food Network show.

The tuna pizza was very good.  It had a very, very thin crust with just enough substance to pick up the pieces and eat it truly like a pizza.  The flavors were great even the truffle oil because it was used sparingly.  The tempura crab was a bit of a disappointment.  It was OK but the tempura was a bit heavy and took away from the crab. I couldn't help but think it was a waste of good crab making it tempura style.  It wouldn't go on my list of best thing I ever ate.

For dessert, I ordered the Chocolate in a cup.  It consisted of Nutella, banana foam, and vanilla bean ice cream.  The Nutella is in the cup and there's a ring on top of the foam that breaks and dissolves into the foam and ice cream.  It was a great dessert.

Service was impeccable.  The view of the fountains is always good.  During dinner, there were three fountain shows.  Prices are Strip prices but I knew this going in so it doesn't affect my rating.",16,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Restaurant Week gave me the push to try Lao Sze Chuan.  I probably wouldn't have stopped here but for their being on the Restaurant Week list.   Their menu actually is four courses and they have flexibility with their offering.

After asking for the Restaurant Week menu, the server brought it to me and explained that I could mix both the appetizers and the mains with smaller portions so you could try more.  Instead of getting three pot stickers, I was able to order 1 Shanghai egg roll, 1 chicken egg roll, and 1 pork pot sticker.  For the main course, I was allowed to get half portions of any two dishes so I ordered the three chili chicken and the lemon shrimp.  I opted for the hot and sour soup and for dessert I ordered the coconut ice cream.

My iced tea was brought quickly and I took the time to enjoy the beautiful room.  It is very nice.  Soon a gentleman brought my hot and sour soup.  When I was halfway through the soup, my server brought me the appetizer.  I just don't understand this lack of serving separate courses that I've experienced in Asian restaurants--twice during this Restaurant Week period.  The hot and sour soup was very good and I wish I had some time to savor the flavors after finishing before having to dig into the appetizer.  The egg rolls were OK.  The pot sticker was a bit of a letdown.  One side was not completely done and had a doughy taste.  With the appetizer I got soy, hot mustard, and sweet and sour sauce.  

The main courses were large servings.  A full serving would be a large amount of food for sure.  The lemon shrimp was very good and consisted of 11 shrimp if I counted correctly.  The three chili chicken was good but it wasn't as spicy as I like.  What kick there was came from cracked pepper in the batter and hot sesame oil.  The plate had a lot of oil from the chicken.  

The coconut ice cream was very good and a nice way to end the meal.  The ice cream not only had a coconut flavor but also had toasted coconut flakes mixed throughout.  Very refreshing.

The service was a mixed bag here.  My server, Rachel, was quite good.  She brought me a fresh iced tea when my first one was only half finished.  She was very pleasant, had a great smile, and if she had been doing all the serving, I have a feeling the soup and the apps wouldn't have overlapped.

This could be a four star place.  I'd recommend they watch the courses and space them out a bit more.  I was in and out of the restaurant in just over 45 minutes.  Give me a little more time to savor the separate parts of the meal.",15,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

There are cup holders attached to the seats in front of you, but it can be a bit of a reach as the legroom in the aisles in excellent.

I ordered the happy hour poke Napoleon, shared the goat cheese appetizer and ordered the fish and chips as my main entree. I also had the coco coffee martini as a drink. 

The poke was nicely presented with guacamole on the bottom layer with poke on top. I enjoyed the creaminess of the avocado with the well seasoned poke. I would have liked more flatbread chips to go with the poke though since I ran out part-way through eating the dish. The goat cheese was a delicious blend of creaminess mixed with the crunchy macadamia nut crust and sweet, slightly tart mango layer on the bottom. 

I wasn't too impressed with my main dish. The fish and chips was a nice presentation of 3 battered pieces of fish, yuca fries and coleslaw. While the fish was flaky and tender on the inside I didn't care for the bread-like, more doughy nature of the batter. I also thought that the coleslaw might have been good as a component in a sandwich but too acidic for my tastes on its own as a side. It needed more sweetness to balance out all the acidic flavor. The yuca fries were well seasoned and lightly fried. I also didn't care for the flavor of the chipotle aioli (Too sour tasting) and the tartar sauce (Also on the verge of being too sour). At $22 for the plate I thought it was way too much money for what I received. 

I didn't really like the coco coffee martini ($6). It was way too sweet and had too much of a one dimensional taste.

We sat on the patio and had a lovely view of Kierland Commons, enjoying the perfect mild weather. The patio is the way to go during happy hour!

Service was overall decent although our server seemed a bit peeved at us towards the end of our meal. Who knew we would be causing him such consternation by asking to have separate checks for a two person table? 

At $38 for a happy hour small plate, entree and non alcoholic drink the price was way too steep for the quality of the food I received. If I go here again I'll just stick to their happy hour small bites since I did enjoy the poke and the goat cheese dish.",32,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Last night's experience was just as good or better than my first time.  There were some dishes that were the same, but many were different.  Sitting in the private room with your fellow diners, watching the chefs put together the courses and watching their meticulous plating work is an incredible experience.  We had only 4 diners last night because the others couldn't keep their reservation due to airline delay.

One of the dishes that I especially like is the dehydrated meringue filled with bleu cheese and topped with praline cream.  This was served both times I was here and it is superb!  One thing new last night was the foie gras baked in salt.  Exceptional when it was served with the citrus juice.

Another dish of note was the crispy chicken skin with two chicken oysters.  Wow, such thin, crisp chicken skin and the wonderful oysters on the skin.  It was a delicate pick up to eat.

One final dish of note, although they almost all are, was the ham and bean soup.  The ham flavor is in the broth and the beans are three large beans created from three kinds of deconstructed beans and reformed into these luscious, soft gems.  Wow!

For anyone who wants to have an exceptional meal, make your reservations via email and do go.  It is pricey, but remember, it is both a show and a great meal all in one.  I'll wager some lose more in a couple hands of blackjack than they'll spend here.

I am pleased to be guest #1693 and #6212.  In another year or so when they rotate some new dishes in, I'll go back and get my third gold ticket--one of the few things I save.",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I'd been wanting to go here since I found out about it 1 or 2 years ago so we made sure we had our schedules cleared to go. Held inside the spacious Westworld indoor building, there was a lot of room for the vendors and booths. The event helps the wonderful Tranquility Trail Animal Sanctuary, and there were a ton of booths to browse through and a lot of raffles you could enter. Several rescues were there too with dogs for adoption. I saw various cute yorkies, corgis, pugs, and great danes, just to name a few rescues! There were also non-dog rescues such as a rat rescue and a sugar glider rescue.

Some other notable booths was a DNA breed testing program, dog accessories, veterinary hospitals, and a dog friendly restaurant (OHSO).

There were all breeds of dogs in various shapes and sizes with their owners. It was cool to be there just to look at all the cute dogs. :) We didn't bring our dogs but all the ones there seemed very friendly and well behaved.

Desserts were good.  I wasn't bowled over by anything in particular.  Perhaps I should have tried a crèpe, but I didn't take the time to wait for one to be made.

The waffles that came with the chicken were very large, and served with butter and maple syrup.  I wasn't a big fan of the red velvet cake though.  It was a bit dry and crumbly.",0,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Rather, the chicken was stewed and the meat was added to the gravy made from the stew juice.  I generally avoid chicken and waffles because of that cultural divide.

I read about Bruxie when the Park was being built and I read about their menu.  It's been bookmarked for almost a year now.  Before the Cirque show at the T-Mobile Arena, I decided to give Bruxie a try.

I looked at the menu and ended up ordering the Nashville style hot chicken waffle.  The menu describes the sandwich this way--Spicy & Smoky Fried Chicken Thigh, Tangy Sauce, Shredded Lettuce, Pickles.  I also ordered an iced tea.

I was given a buzzer and told to sit anywhere I wanted.  They'd bring the food to me when it was ready.  I put the buzzer on the table and went to the area where you get napkins, cutlery, and sweetener.  One of the women brought my tea and said I could have a refill if I wanted.  Shortly after, the woman brought me the metal mini-tray with a cardboard in the bottom for liquids.  I cut the waffle in half and then proceeded to enjoy it.  The waffle was soft with just a small amount of crust.  As I was finishing the second part of the sandwich, the waffle had lost all firmness and it just melted into the food.

As long as I was here, I decided to do it all.  I ordered a dessert waffle and it was a toss up between two but I decided on the Nutella and banana.  It was a bit smaller than the sandwich waffle.  The Nutella was spread on the waffle and then sliced banana was added.  This was good.

Bruxie gives you a fast food option in the area that's different.  I enjoyed my food there.  I would recommend they turn the music down about 20 decibels.  It would have been difficult to carry on a conversation with the loudness of the music.

I might come back and try something else here.  I like the concept.",15,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The first time we went here our burgers were more on the well done side rather than medium as requested, but were still tasty. I've also had the salmon BLT, which had a generous portion of tender salmon with crispy bacon and lettuce. 

While I've enjoyed the food here, service can be hit or miss depending on how busy it is. On our last visit they were severely understaffed and the poor waitress was the only one there to check up on a nearly full seating of tables.

The plus of outside seating is that they are extremely dog friendly. The minus of eating outside (If you are sensitive to smoke) is the plethora of smokers that tend to frequent this restaurant.

While the atmosphere is great, some of the chairs could use some cleaning or replacement. The ones at our table had cushions that were supposed to be a cream color, but had some dirty brown spots on them.

I was going to get some jambalaya as I had in the past, but it looked liked there were cubes of processed ham instead of the sausage they used to have.  I skipped this dish.  I did get some salt and pepper fried oysters.  They were very tasty, but the breading was quite think and soft--a problem with some buffet food items.

They did have some nice vegetables--cauliflower in a cheese sauce (a little watery) and brussel sprouts with pieces of cooked bacon.

I was going to get the mixed seafood, octopus, oysters, and shrimp but I had a language problem last night with the nice senora at the register.  I ended up with a shrimp only cocktail but it was everything I wanted!

I got their small size which is called medium for some reason.  There is no small!  The preparer takes a good sized mug and she puts two and a half ice cream scoops of medium sized shrimp in the mug.  Then she adds some pico, an avocado diced in small pieces and fills the entire mug with a tangy tomato sauce.  The pico is fresh cubed tomato, celery, and onions.

With this beautiful mug, you get a basket of chips with a half lime for your cocktail.  Also, the required hot sauce, in this case, Tapatio is put on the pick up counter next to the mug and the chips.  OK, you never have to twist my arm when it comes to hot sauce.

I ate the cocktail in what could have been record time.  What wonderful flavors!  Now I know what I'll do when I get the urge again.  There's another Los Tacos on West Sahara, much closer to me.  I'll go there and get the mixed seafood, large this time, and I'll make a stop somewhere else, El Pollo Loco perhaps, for my gringa wife.

My server was Roque and he was excellent throughout my time there.  He was at the table quickly with menus and taking my drink order.  He made some recommendations and I had some questions about the size of different items on the menu.  In the end, I opted for the 16 ounce bone in filet and an order of duck fat fries.  I asked for the steak to be extra rare.  A bit later, Roque returned and asked if I wanted the steak seared on each side.

The bread service was good with two kinds of bread--mini loaves of salted topped herb bread and two baguette rolls.  The butter was unsalted but the salt on the one loaf made up for it.  My iced tea was brought promptly and it was always refilled without asking throughout the time I was there.  Empty sweetener packs were removed quickly.

The steak was brought and it had an excellent char and was beautifully rare.  It was also a very flavorful steak.  The duck fries were seasoned well but there was nothing out of the ordinary with them.  I really wanted to pick up the bone and gnaw some more meat off but I decided against that.

I ordered doughnut bread pudding for dessert.  They make doughnuts every day, cool them, pull them apart, mix them back together with the liquid necessary to form bread pudding and bake it in a ring.  Later, it's reheated, topped with caramel sauce and a dollop of vanilla bean ice cream.  It was very good and a great way to end a meal.  There's no reason to mess around with an appetizer when you can save room for the sweet ending!

Roque came back several times during the meal to see if everything was OK and to check to see if I needed anything.  He learned that I was a local and we had some small talk about things to do around Las Vegas that make this place such a wonderful place to live--like hiking to work off a meal.

AYPn2O17T7IEjPIma48uIg,0,2014-02-21,0,cQLqHxfGnvxFIq0AlPpNTw,5,"I actually didn't directly come to AAA for an audition. My dog was ""discovered"" by Kama when I brought him in for an agility evaluation. He knew a few tricks, and had a good sit/stay, which he demonstrated quite well that day!

Since then, he's been in a commercial, a print ad, and they've even asked me to do some modeling for an ad! My dog has had fun on these shoots, and comes back home eager to practice some more (What dog wouldn't love constant treats for doing tricks in a short amount of time?)! My younger dog has also been in a print ad, which was a great experience for her.

Please please, know these things before auditioning your pet for an acting agency:

1. It's very important for your dog to be very good with other animals and people (Non-reactive), and as distraction proof as possible. Many acting and modeling gigs run on a tight schedule, and an obedient dog that won't get easily distracted is a must. It's also important for your dog to be trained to do tricks not just at home, but in different environments. 

If your dog isn't ready quite yet for any jobs though, Kama and Jubie are excellent at training, and any suggestions they have are only in the best interest for you and your dog so that you can both be better prepared for the industry.

2. Once your dog auditions and is part of the agency, it's just like being a human actor at an acting agency. Many jobs require a certain type/breed of dog, so if you are relying solely on the agency for jobs, you might be waiting for the right part to come your way.

3. A lot of jobs happen at the last minute, so having a flexible schedule is important.

In all the jobs I've been to, Kama and/or Jubie have been there to make sure everything runs smoothly, and to give any helpful hints to make sure the talent hired performs reliably, admirably, while having fun at the same time. 

Overall, it's been an interesting experience being in the pet entertainment industry!",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

In my early teens, I thought it got boring because it was always the same.  It's been 50+ years since I've been to a circus and I decided to see Circus Vargas because it was close to home.

This year, the circus was held on the bare land in Boca Park.  Parking was a breeze.  The tent housing the circus is not all that large.  It's a one ring, no animal traveling circus similar to European circuses.

The show last about 90 minutes including a 10 to 15 minute break for snacks/drinks/bathroom or just stand up and stretch.

There was a variety of acts from acrobats to trapeze and there were moments of levity when the clown(s) took over.  There was some audience participation and it was fun and not embarrassing to the person chosen.  One was with a group of youngsters.

I'd recommend this to anyone when it comes back to Las Vegas.  It's very good family entertainment and it will bring a smile to the face of all regardless of age.  It was a lot of fun seeing a circus after so many years break.",13,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The meal was OK.  For starters, they brought a bread basket with a small loaf of Italian bread and two breadsticks.  The server poured some olive oil and balsamic onto a dish for dipping.  Since I'm not a big fan of balsamic, which I think is too sweet, I liberally sprinkled my dipping mixture with salt to cut the sweetness.  The bread was fresh and tasty.

I ordered the lobster bisque for an appetizer.  It had a lobster flavor but there were no pieces of lobster to be found.  There were two ravioli on the bottom of the bowl that may have had some type of ground lobster filling but there was no flavor of lobster from the ravioli.

For the main course, I ordered the New York strip steak and frites.  I also ordered a side of wilted spinach.  I ordered the steak black and blue and I specified extra rare.  The meat was done more than that but it was acceptable.  I wish they'd just do black and blue.  You can't un-cook meat but you can heat it some more if it's too rare.  The steak was a bit tough to cut, but it was OK to eat.  Perhaps they need better steak knives?  The spinach came with lots of freshly sliced garlic and was very good.

For dessert, I ordered the crème brûlée.  It was different than I've had before.  My server told me to make sure I spooned to the bottom.  This brûlée had a layer of semi-sweet chocolate on the bottom and then the vanilla bean crème with the glazed top.  There were some blueberries and a 1/2 strawberry on top.  Dessert was very good.

Service was very good.  My server, Frank and his bus person, Umberto, were on top of things.  Iced tea was refilled without asking and Frank came often to check on how I was doing and to see if I needed anything.  I was greeted promptly at the podium and the woman asked me if I had any comp, coupon, Groupon or anything else like that.  When I said Groupon, she told me to make sure I showed it to the server.

At the end of the meal, Frank asked me if I would take a short survey they were doing.  There were at most 10 questions with an excellent to poor scale to rate various aspects of dining at Le Provençal.  It was actually a 32 gb iPod in a large case so you didn't pocket it and walk out the door.

The restaurant is a little pricey.  Comparing it to Mon Ami Gabi, I'd go with Gabi for the entire experience.  I'm glad I gave this place a try.  It was a pleasant experience and a fairly good meal.

I was going to a show at the Venetian Theatre last night and I decided to give B&B Burger a go.  The place was almost empty.  I opted to sit at the bar where I could watch the basketball game while eating.

Omar, the barkeep, brought menus to me promptly and got my iced tea.  I ordered a morning after burger and an order of fries.  My iced tea was kept refilled during dinner and it was a pleasant place to sit and enjoy the food while watching the game.

In a short time, a runner brought my burger and fries.  It was cooked just the way I asked--rare.  The meat was red and I was pleased.  The morning after burger consists of a good sized burger with sautéed mushrooms, fontina cheese, a sunny side up egg, truffle aioli, and frisée.  The serving of fries was a standard size and they were good.  

Because of the sunny side up egg, I opted to eat the burger as if it were an open faced sandwich.  The last thing I wanted was dripping yolk on my clothes before a show.  The burger was juicy and the egg and fontina cheese added nicely to the flavor.

At the end of the meal, I asked about dessert.  Omar told me they had shakes.  Originally they did have desserts when the place opened, but they just didn't sell so they dropped them.  I opted to have a refill of my iced tea and I knew I could find somewhere else for my after dinner sugar fix.  Omar asked if I wanted the iced tea placed in a to go glass.  Nice touch and thoughtful service.

The restaurant is in a bit of an out of the way corner.  I think the target market are the poker players from the poker room next door and the race and sports bettors from across the hallway.

My server was Mary and she saw to it that I got my iced tea quickly and she gave me plenty of time to look over the menu and then answer some questions.  For an appetizer, I got the Siberian nachos.  This is a fun way of doing nachos in a different manner.  There are five, very thinly sliced,waffle potato chips each with a nice slice of very good smoked salmon.  Topping each is a small dollop of caviar and sour cream.  The potato slices are so delicate, you can't pick up the chip and eat it with the salmon on top.

The main course had to be beef stroganoff.  This was made differently than I've ever had before but it was no less good.  In fact, this was the star of the meal and I recommend anyone eating here try the stroganoff.  It's a braised short rib that was extremely tender accompanied by wild mushroom tagliatelle.  There is some truffle flavored ricotta placed between the pasta and the beef.  Unlike what we normally think of stroganoff, this one was not heavy on sour cream to make a gravy for the beef.  Rather, the ricotta simply becomes blended a bit with the very good juices from the meat.  I like their way of doing stroganoff.

I took Mary's advice for dessert--it's actually what I was going to order anyway.  This was good but was a bit of a disappointment.  The strawberry baked Alaska wasn't made nor served like a traditional baked Alaska which could have been OK except for one thing.  The base was a thin sponge cake with some fresh strawberry slices.  This was topped with some strawberry ice cream, and then the whole thing was mounded--not with meringue--but with marshmallow fluff that had been browned.  When I put my spoon to what I thought was meringue I learned by the very thick consistency how wrong I was.  The marshmallow was overwhelming in texture and in sweetness!  I was glad to get below to the strawberry ice cream to offset some of the cloying sweetness.

Service during dinner was excellent and Mary was a very pleasant server who made the dinner pleasant.  The runners made sure my iced tea was refilled as soon as I finished my glass.

I like the room with it's Soviet themes.  This starts with the beheaded statue of Vladimir I. Lenin at the entrance.  The head was cut off and is in a freezer in the vodka tasting lounge where you get bottle service.  Above the door inside is CCCP for the Soviet Union and there's a hammer and sickle vodka vault sign by the bar and I could see part of the one mural in the bar/lounge area about a delegate--that's all I could read of the Russian letters.  While passing time between courses, I did notice that on the wall above the side of the bar, they have misspelled the Russian word for Square in their Red Square.  Perhaps it's the teacher in me and maybe it was my tough Russian professor in undergraduate school.

We stopped last night and had dinner.  I had looked over the menu online but I wanted to look at theirs in house as there were other items than the tapas I'd seen online.  Our server brought iced tea.  We had to wait a bit to catch the server's eye to get some Sweet 'n Low but eventually we got it.

The complimentary toasted slices of bread were nice.  I used it more for a pusher than anything else.  

I ordered three items to start_an order of sautéed mushrooms in garlic and sherry wine, gnocchi with shrimp in a garlic cream sauce (I thought I'd be able to sneak the shrimp past my wife), and last, an order of croquetas with ham, cream cheese, and béchamel.  

The winner of the trio was the gnocchi with shrimp.  When my wife got to the one shrimp I hadn't been able to screen out with the spoon, that was all for her.  Score for me--I finished the dish.  The gnocchi were soft and the shrimp, although small, were good.  It was a nice combination.  Next, the garlic mushrooms were really good.  Sautéed nicely in garlic and sherry, the mushrooms were very good.  The disappointing dish for me was the croquetas.  They were very light and had hardly and body to them yet it was difficult to pick them up.  They broke in half.  There was not a béchamel sauce but a marinara like sauce.

We decided not to order more.  The three dishes were filling--well almost.  We ordered the chocolate lava cake.  It takes 15 minutes to make (the menu states this clearly so if you're in a hurry, order early).  The lava cake was rich chocolate cake with chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  A nice way to end a good dinner.

Service was spotty.  Our server seemed to be nowhere in sight for much of the time while the server who had the tables on each side of us seemed to be at those tables all the time and the place was not that crowded.  During dinner, the owner came around to ask how things were and the personal touch is always appreciated.  It's also very good business.  The spotty service kept me from giving Toros four stars.

I thought the pricing was very fair.  If you subtract the desert we had from the bill, the total would equal about what I paid for 1 person at another tapas place and I left hungry.  Two of us ate for the same coast and we left without feeling hunger.

We need to come back and try some of the other dishes.  I also need to come back with some friends and without my wife.  There are items I'd like to try from the menu that she won't eat!  Her loss.  Time for a UYE?",8,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

OK with all the pun and bad joke groaning aside (Can you tell I wrote this on May the 4th?), they do a pretty good job here at making fresh bowls that you build to your liking. It's not quite poke, not quite chirashi. I guess you could call it a unique creation using fresh seafood.

You get your choice of 2 or 3 scoops of seafood (Choices include salmon, tuna, spicy tuna, yellowtail, scallops, shrimp), base filler (White rice, brown rice, salad), any toppings you want (E.g. seaweed salad, pickled ginger, masago), sauce, and any seasonings (Such as sesame seed, red chile flake). 

I got a two scoop with half brown rice half salad, salmon and yellowtail, house spicy sauce, all the toppings, and sesame seed. Everything tasted very fresh, especially the fish. There was too much dressing on the salad unfortunately as the flavor blew my taste buds out from tasting too much salty sauce. Overall I enjoyed my meal though. I also ordered a Thai iced tea which was a perfect amount of sweetness and lightly creamy tasting.

Stepped in and had an amazing array of various appetizers before our main entrees arrived. We shared the ahi tuna, Scotch eggs, and ceviche. The ceviche had a nice spicy kick to it and had a good balance of sweetness and acidity. The Scotch eggs were probably my favorite part of the meal. They were perfectly cooked, with a slightly runny, dark golden center and perfectly fried, providing a good balance of textures. The ahi was decent and came in a very generous portion.

I ordered the filet mignon ($28). It arrived with some grilled asparagus, perched on top of some mashed potatoes. The filet had lovely deep grill marks, Coated with a thin layer of butter. The server asked us to cut into the meat to make sure we were happy with the doneness (Medium rare), which I appreciated. The mashed potatoes were decent, and the asparagus was grilled nicely.

To gild the lily we ended our meal by sharing some creme brulée. It was a very rich concoction, packed with buttery taste. While the sugary, caramelized crystalline top was excellent the rest of the dessert was just a little runny.

Service was excellent and were checked on as needed.

The theatre is exquisite with every detail of its design well conceived and executed!  The ""Eternal Audience"" is a brilliant device to gather you into the opera house mystique. The costumes are wonderful and have been kept in great shape during the run.

The cast, though it changes from time to time, is really good.  The Phantoms have all been very credible tenors, and the current Christines do a fantastic job.  

Add in the pyrotechnics and you have a recipe for a spectacular night of theatre.  My only complaint about the show was the speed up of the orchestra.  When I see the show, I wanted to applaud more, but the conductor moves the orchestra along and cuts off some of the applause so as to stay in their time constraints.

As for seating recommendations, I always sit in the Gold Circle.  While the chandelier scenes are above and behind me, I can turn around for that period of time.  The action I care for most is on the stage.  That's why I got a front row seat the last time I saw the show.

After playing for awhile, I decided to walk over and check it out.  I'm glad I did.  I wasn't in the mood for flatbread or a crèpe but the thought of gelato on an upper 90 degree day was enticing.  I saw on their board that they had Nutella gelato.  Well, they do and they don't.  It's one of their flavors but only in a rotating fashion and it wasn't one of the flavors yesterday.

I could tell from the time we walked in that they did their own smoking.  The place is heavy with the smell of smoke.  In fact, the first thing I did when I got home was to change my shirt.

The trio of meats was OK.  The pork was lukewarm at best and was dry.  It needed their BBQ sauce.

I actually tried to order something from here a few days before our visit today, but unfortunately someone had broken into the restaurant the night before so they had to temporarily close for the day. I felt really bad for them. As a small business around the holiday season this is the one of the worst things I can imagine happening to them. I resolved to go back in a few days to help them out with our patronage.

Millie's Cafe has a wonderful selection of Puerto Rican dishes. Finally, I've found a place that has good mofongo! I ordered it con cerdo (With pork) and also had some pasteles, one of each variety (Yucca and pork, plantain and pork), and had a bite of the tripleta sandwich.

The pasteles came out and smelled delicious. They are similar to a tamale, but are wrapped in banana leaf and use plantain or yucca instead of corn for the dough. I wasn't exactly sure which one was the yucca and which one was the plantain but they both were well seasoned and moist. The yellow colored one (I think it was the yucca) had a super soft spongy texture. The browner colored one (Probably the plantain) was more enjoyable for me due to the mix of seasonings and the slightly firmer texture.

I liked this rendition of mofongo. It had crispy bits of pork and plantain adding to the softer textures of the mashed plantain. There was a generous portion of roasted pork to go with it as well.

The tripleta sandwich was awesome. It had the perfect mix of textures, seasoning, soft inner portion of bread, perfectly crispy pressed outer portion of bread, meat and vegetables. We had a bottle of spicy house-made sauce to go with our meal which was piquant and a good compliment to our entrees.

Service was friendly and warm. Unfortunately the soda machine was out of order when we went but they did have bottled sodas and juices available.

I've been to Bishop Gorman several times to see shows in the Jim 3 House of performing Arts.  The Jim 3 entrance is directly across from the stadium entrance.  The performing arts center has both an auditorium for large productions and a smaller black box theatre.

The seating in the main theatre is classic high school auditorium.  There is a proscenium stage and the seating is arranged in three sections, left, center, and right--standard seating for many theatres.  Seating is comfortable.  If I had any quibble with the auditorium it would be that I think the pitch of the seating should be a greater degree to ensure better viewing when you have a tall, big hair person, or inconsiderate jerk who sits there with a hat (oh there are more jerks than you think, male and female).

Last night, I attended a production of Stephen Sondheim's ""Into the Woods.""  The lighting in the theatre was well designed.  Most of it is above the first few rows in a ceiling area, and it's very much out of the way and unseen.  Sound in the theatre is great!

On the one hand, it's necessary to see Dr. Mukhopadhyay as needed for digestive ailments or in my case, colon screening because I'm of the age when that's a diagnostic test which can detect cancer of the colon early.  On the other hand, having the procedure done isn't a lot of fun.  Well, at least the getting ready part the night before isn't much fun.

As for the test itself, once the cleanse is finished and you're at the Summerlin Hospital Endoscopy Center, the nap is quite refreshing and you remember nothing!

My follow up visit with the doctor--note how I avoid typing his name twice--was good news and I don't have to see him for another 5 years!

lpD3xIYuVaQA8xRSlKwn-Q,2,2013-04-06,1,2tDeW959N1Y_zDgPVURjuQ,3,"La Fonda serves up no surprises, which is for some, exactly what they want in a Mexican restaurant. They have your standard array of chimichangas, fajitas, enchiladas, burros, and tacos, just to name a few, in your basic meats with a smattering of vegetarian options. Flavors aren't particularly bold, spicy, or stand out in my mind, but the food itself tastes decent. 

We started off with the obligatory chips and salsa. The chips were freshly made, light and crispy. There were 2 different salsas to dip your chips in, which I appreciated. There was a chunky mild salsa, and a more uniform blend of spicy salsa. Out of the two, the chunky salsa had more flavor for me. As for entrees, I tried some of the chicken chimichanga and had the spinach enchiladas. The chicken chimichanga was what you'd expect in your typical chimi: shredded marinated chicken, crispy, deep fried outer tortilla. The chicken was juicy, and it was served with guacamole, beans, cheese, and rice. The spinach enchilada was OK. It had a good amount of spinach with sauteed onion, with your choice of enchilada sauce (Red, green, or fundido). I had it with the red sauce. I didn't see much of the sauce, and perhaps the kitchen was compensating for this by using a ton of cheese in my plate. In addition to the cheese on top of the enchilada, there seemed to be an equal amount of cheese to beans and rice in my sides! For the dairy-inclined, you would be in paradise!

Our server was attentive and friendly. Drinks were refilled as needed.

The decor was probably the most distinctive element of the restaurant. Remembering how it used to look back when this building housed Chuy's, La Fonda's improvements have turned what used to be a divey, beachy, beer-guzzling bar into a warm welcoming Southwestern atmosphere. 

So if you're looking for a ""safe"" but not particularly inventive cuisine, in a cute scenic atmosphere, La Fonda is your place.",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

There is usually a special exhibit, and the ones I've been to have been superb.  The current one, Paper!, despite the pedestrian name, is actually a very interesting exhibit, for there are some famous artists' works on exhibit at this show, including M.C. Escher, Warhol, Duher, Joseph Cornell, Toulouse-Lautrec, and Rembrandt just to name a few. The paper exhibit is not limited to 2D art, for there are some paper fashions from such designers as Chanel (by Karl Lagerfeld), as well as some political ad paper dresses from the '60s (Examples include a Nixon dress, and a ""Romney for President"" paper dress).  There are also amazing sculptures made from paper that really utilize the medium well.  There is a good mix of contemporary art as well as art from the old masters.  One of the more contemporary artists on exhibit did an amazing woodblock print piece called ""The Triumph of Death"" that spans a whole wall, but is actually made up of pieces of individual woodblock prints put together to form a cohesive whole.  The detail in it was amazing, and it reminded me a little of some of Bosch's cautionary works, except with a Latin twist.

My friend: ""Yeah, I thought it was some sort of weight loss program""
Another friend who I invited along: ""Oh that place? I thought they sold watches!""

Name confusion aside, we came here for brunch on a Sunday.  It was fairly busy, with a 25 minute wait, which wasn't so bad since they have free coffee at the counter for you.  I didn't have any, but my friend said it tasted good.

We got seated and the waitress took our orders.  When it came to my turn to order, I pointed out what I wanted on the menu (eggs benedict florentine) and the waitress repeated what I said.  About five minutes later, another waitress comes by and asks us ""whoever had the skillet, how did you want your eggs?""  We all look at each other- no one ordered a skillet?  

The waitress said she'd get the original waitress to sort it out.  Well... a few minutes after that,  yet another waitress comes along and sorts out our orders.  Apparently the person taking my order wrote down skillet instead of eggs benedict, even though she repeated what I had ordered, and saw what I had pointed to on the menu.  To be fair, she was new on the job, but in general it seemed like the service was unorganized (after we got all our food yet ANOTHER waitress came by with another order of my friend's food- oops for them)

So.... food is good, service is spotty, and I was slightly grossed out by the bits of stuck on egg that was left on my knife.  It took me 3 times of asking the various waitresses to get a new knife!

I ordered the chef's tasting menu with the following choices:  lobster bisque, Kurobuta pork belly, filet mignon and shrimp scampi, and a chocolate duo for dessert.

I was soon brought a small bread basket--two rolls and a piece of lavash along with three butter florets, one sweet, one pesto flavored, and the third was ginger peach.  The best was the pesto but it's best to let the butter come closer to room temperature to get the most of the flavors.  I'm glad they downsized the bread basket for one person.  It's smarter than bringing a regular basket and a lot of it goes back.

The lobster bisque was a win.  There was a fair amount of lobster and the broth was good.  The pork belly was a let down.  The menu says that it has root vegetables, farro, quinoa, chimichurri, Chinese five spice.  All these ingredients tended to overpower the pork belly, not enhance it.  The filet was cooked blue as I ordered.  It and two shrimp scampi were served on a  bed of mashed potatoes along with some green beans.  The steak had a red wine reduction and I'd say this was the best part of the meal.  There is no choice for dessert--it's a chocolate duo consisting of two chocolate dishes.  One is a dark chocolate pot de crème--very rich and very good.  The other was a white chocolate shaped cup holding some fresh berries and vanilla mousseline.

Service was excellent during the meal.  Mirella brought me a fresh glass of iced tea before I asked for a refill and she was there to refill my coffee with dessert.

The view is great.  I found myself less concentrated on looking at Las Vegas Boulevard and the Strip hotels and more of the neighborhoods.  The tourists were all taking photos of the Strip.

The meal was A-OK but you're paying Strip prices plus an extra for the view.  The bonus is you have access to the rooftop observation deck after dinner.  If you subtract the $12 cost of just going up the tower for the view, the price is a bit better.",21,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I like it so much when menus are posted online and I had already chosen the breakfast I was going to get.  When it came time to order, I took my server's recommendation and ordered the rib eye steak chilaquiles.  I chose the pot of bread instead of toast or biscuit.  The bread was good, but I wish it had more cinnamon.  That would have made it and outstanding breakfast accompaniment.

The main action was the spice rubbed rib eye steak--there was a small amount of rub flavoring--and it was done rare just the way I ordered it.  For the eggs, I got over easy which was put on top of the refried beans and chips of the chilaquiles.  The cotija cheese added so much flavor!  The eggs were topped with sliced avocado.  Very nice presentation.

I was greeted promptly on arrival and asked if I was getting take out or eating in.  The woman told me to sit anywhere I wanted because I was eating in and she gave me their small menu.  I had seen several people rave about the curry chicken with roti so that's what I ordered.  In a short time, the cook brought out a bowl of curry chicken and a plate with three very hot, fresh roti.  

The curry chicken was good but it would be better named curry potato with chicken and roti.  I had two large chunks of potato, one large cube of chicken (smaller that either of the two potato pieces), while the rest was curry sauce with some chicken shreds.  The curry was tasty and the roti were very good.

As I waited for my dinner to be brought, I noticed on their wall--which has a lot of homemade signs for new dishes--that the curry chicken was listed under appetizers.  No wonder the price is only $4.95.  No wonder the portion is much less than a curry chicken you'd get in a Thai restaurant, and for $4.95 I wasn't expecting that.

I was going to order something else, perhaps some ramen or just a pudding for dessert.  There were two customers including myself in this small place that has a maximum capacity of 68 people.  All the time I waited for my order and ate, the woman was on the phone--not taking orders--but chatting.  If she wasn't on the phone, she was putting business cards in a plastic holder in a notebook and she was engrossed with that task rather than all two of her customers--the other who ordered directly from the cook and had no interaction with the woman.

After waiting approximately five minutes for her to get off the phone or at least look my way so I could get her attention, I got up to leave.  I approached the counter and she told whomever was on the phone to hold, she took, my money, gave me change, and went back to her telephone.

I don't think I'll return.  If it's like this when they're two people there, what would it be like when they're busy--say ten people.  It's just not worth it.

All the recommendations I had gotten were spot on.  This place is good!  I was fortunate to be able to order a prix fixe lunch with Chef Johnny Church deciding on the items I'd get.  They were:

Ibérico ham amuse-bouche with caviar
Curry Kabocha squash soup
Piedmontese beef and octopus carpaccio
Lion fish ceviche
Pancakes with seared Sonoma foie gras
Hand cut pappardelle with Bolognese
Crispy brick chicken thigh
Hexx chocolate pot de crème

This lunch was dinner also because there was a lot of food and I didn't let anything go unfinished.  I was impressed with ingredients and preparations I don't normally see.  Tremendous creativity.  One of the last things I would have ordered would be the pancakes.  Yet, it was an excellent dish with a mix of three kinds of grape made into a gastrique and served with foie gras topping the small stack of mini pancakes.  Fantastic flavors and since I don't use maple syrup, a delight having a sweet that was so different with pancakes.

Chef Church asked me which pasta of two on the menu I wanted.  I looked at both and went with the Bolognese.  What he did was serve me the Bolognese with the hand cut pappardelle which was the other pasta.  The pork sausage, ground lamb, and chicken liver confit along with the tomato and mirepoix provided a great pasta.  The Bolognese was very rich.

I need mention the soup.  The curry squash soup had a very good flavor of curry and was a delightful soup on this cold day.

Finally, the crispy chicken thighs on mushroom bread pudding was outstanding.  Chicken thighs cooked and removed from the bone, then put back together with a layer of truffle and quickly fried crispy and served on the bead of mushroom bread pudding.  Outstanding!

Finishing off with a light dessert of Hexx chocolate pot de crème topped with orange slices and topped with fennel pollen.  Chocolate and orange is always a great combination and this was a winner, too!

I'll be returning and enjoying some of the other items on the menu.  This café, although small and seating maybe twenty people at one time, is one of those places that will draw me back.  A most memorable lunch!",20,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw,0,2013-08-17,0,3BVBfgvNkeuyzYsdqvKmUQ,5,"Having read all the good reviews, we were eager to try out this posh restaurant serving high quality cuts of meat and fish. Reservations were easy through Opentable. 

The restaurant itself is a large space, with high ceilings which makes for a very open, airy environment. Decor is tasteful, minimal, and more modern, with light brown tones. The kitchen is within eye sight of each diner, and is an open layout so that you can see them preparing your meal for you as you wait.

We were seated promptly and browsed through the menu. There's a lot to choose from, and I think most people will find something they'll like here. We decided on some appetizers- the beef and kimchi dumplings, and prawns + butterfish tempura. The dumplings were fried like potstickers, and had a nice contrast of crunch with tender dumpling wrapping. The filling was very flavorful due to the high quality Wagyu beef with pungent  tasting kimchi. The tempura was excellent. Both prawns and butterfish were battered and fried to perfection for a crunchy, yet light outer coating with tender and flavorful seafood.

We ordered entrees for our main courses- the Jidori chicken and salmon. I was excited to try the Jidori chicken, whose claim to fame is a tastier chicken from freshness (They are typically shipped and sold within 12 to 24 hours of slaughter), as well as being raised free-range and fed all natural feed (No antibiotics). Indeed, the chicken had a ""cleaner"" taste as the brand touts. The salmon was good as well, but I felt like both the chicken and the salmon weren't as tasty and innovative as the appetizers. 

They have a fairly extensive menu of beef cuts that looked appealing, so I may try that next time I want to splurge. I'd also like to try some of their sushi and sashimi.

We ended our meal with some dessert. I absolutely loved the honey chawanmushi. It's basically a Japanese style custard, and is typically a savory dish, but at Roka Akor they crafted it into a light, delectable dessert. I could eat a whole vat of this stuff if it were available!

If you are looking for a tasty non-alcoholic beverage to go with your meal, their yuzu lemonade is delicious.

Service was great. Our server was attentive, and offered suggestions on what to get.

We used a Groupon and had no problem redeeming it.

Spicy chili shrimp
Garlic crab
Pork dumplings
Rack of lamb
Angus beef short ribs

In addition, we were served to small salads--a bean sprout and bell pepper one and a pork and edamame salad.  All items were shared by the three of us.

Outstanding dishes were the soup, the lobster salad, the short ribs and mostly the rack of lamb.  The sauce on the lamb was very rich and flavorful.  The beef short ribs were tender and flavorful also.  The presentation of both of these dishes was nicely done.  The short ribs--cooked for 6 hours using different methods during the time--was sliced and placed on a large rib bone.  Just tremendous presentation with flavor to go with it.

The star was the rack of lamb.  Tender and fatty ribs of lamb that were cooked rare.  The fat in the ribs gave them a lot of flavor when compared to lamb that is sometimes drier because it's been cooked too long and is very lean.  This was excellent.

Niu-Gu is changing from being a noodle house to being a restaurant that serves upscale Chinese food at a good price point.

Every two weeks, I come back from the gym, shower quickly, and then make a quick escape from the two so I don't have to hear their silly chatter.  More important, they want me the hell out of the way!

I needed to make a stop downtown anyway so I quickly decided to head for this Denny's.  I've driven by after a show several times and I wanted to try it. I parked in the city owned garage below Neonopolis and it's a short walk one flight up to get to the store areas and the Denny's.  The entrance is on the side.

I ordered a Start Up omelette which is a 3 egg omelette with a choice of cheese and comes with toast and hash browns or grits.  I got tomato slices instead of the toast and grits.  I had already been brought fresh coffee.

The omelette was a standard one with a fair amount of cheese inside.  The tomato slices were a nice change from the carbs of the breakfast sides.  The plate was one of the hottest plates I've touched in quite awhile and it kept the breakfast warm while I ate.

My server was a young woman who was very pleasant.  She brought me some Cholula as requested.  That's always a bonus.

One criticism--the small booths are really small!!  It would be hard to fit two standard sized adults in the space.  I pushed the table almost to the far side of the booth.  Sit at the counter or outside.

A couple of things.  They advertise that this is the only Denny's in the world with a wedding chapel.  Well, not really.  There's an area with some wedding photos on the wall and if you want to get married at Denny's in downtown Las Vegas, that's where it will be.  They move the tables aside and you exchange your vows there.  I am aware from the news that there has been a wedding here.  Well, the licenses are sold only a few blocks away.  Second thing, the parking in the garage below Neonopolis is so convenient.  Denny's does not validate for this city owned garage but I had no payment due when I left.  perhaps it was the time of day, the day of the week, or merely the fact that I was here for less than an hour.

My seat was in the next to last row which was fine.  The Fator Theatre has three large screens, one on each side of the stage and a large one behind the performers.  I came to hear the music, not see the guys per se.

The show is roughly divided into 4 parts.  The first part has the group singing some of their hits--none of which I recognized--but I enjoyed them all.  They have a good sound and the guys are very talented.  The band was excellent.  The second part of the show was a salute to Motown.  OK, now you're singing songs I know because they're going back in time.  After the Motown salute, there's a period of a cappella music--the music that got them their start.  They're joined by a 4th singer for this section.  Finally, they go back to singing some of their own songs.  

Much of the audience got right into the show from the get go.  For the most part, they were several years younger than me.  They could sing along for they knew all the lyrics.  Wow, and can women shriek with ear splitting loudness!

Mount Charleston
Blueberry gravlax
Foie gras Benedict
Chicken and mash
Steak and egg with potatoes
Botequito sliders
Champagne pancakes
Caramel budino
Brigadeiro Beast--not ordered but brought out by the chef

A few of the dishes stand out--the blueberry gravlax. foie gras Benedict, and the chicken and mash.  The blueberry gravlax was well cured and was quite good.  The chicken with vegetables accompanied by very good mashed potatoes was a standout.  The chicken was tasty and the pearl onions added to the flavor.  The mashed potatoes were very well done.  The foie gras Benedict had two perfectly poached eggs on brioche toast with foie.

I was less impressed with the Mount Charleston and the champagne pancake. The steak and egg was listed as steak and latkes but the egg was served on a layered pile of thinly sliced, cooked potatoes.

The place has a bit of work to do to get their plates to match what the menu says.  Prices were reasonable.

There is seating both inside and outside, and there is a counter with bar seating as well as a case of pastries for quickie to-go orders.

After browsing through the breakfast menu I went with the veggie cheese omelette with home fries and multigrain toast. It was made in record time and a very generous amount of food. 

The omelette was super fluffy and soft, mixed in with a lot of chopped peppers, onions, and spinach. It could have used a touch more seasoning but overall I enjoyed it. The potatoes were soft and were too mealy tasting for me. Some more browning to crisp up the edges would help with the texture in general. The house-made jam served with the toast was actually my favorite part of the meal. It was lightly sweet and oh so fabulous. I scooped up as much as I could onto my toast.

Zinburger offers beef burgers which are a mix of Angus and Kobe style beef for your standard patty, although you can use 100% Kobe for $5 more.  They offer several different variations on the standard burger and fries, and also offer a veggie burger, chicken, ahi tuna, and turkey for those that aren't beef inclined.  They also offer upscale milkshakes ($6 each) with flavors such as bananas foster and creme brulee.  

We ate here for dinner on a Sunday night, and had a fairly large party to seat.  There were no problems getting seating for us when we arrived (Around 5:30 P.M.), and service was prompt.  I had the bananas foster shake ($6), double truffle fries ($6), and a veggie burger ($9).  I also had some of the El Diablo burger ($10).  The shake was thick, rich, and had a nice light banana flavor from the fresh bananas.  The ice cream they use here is Breyer's, which was a nice touch.  The double truffle fries were nice and they were hand cut, but a lot of our fries were ""frylets"" in that they were smallish pieces of potato rather than average sized strips you can easily grab with your fingers (Versus having to grab a lot at a time with the ""frylets"").  I could taste a lot of white truffle flavor from the white truffle oil they used in both the fries and the aioli.  The aioli itself though tasted like white truffle infused mayo rather than a garlicy aioli.  

The veggie patty was nice in that it tasted like it was made fresh vs. using a already-formed patty.  It was a black bean mixture, and while the sides of the burger had a nice crunch to combat the mushy texture of the bean patty inside, the inner part of the burger tasted like mushy black beans.  Perhaps some grain inside of the burger would help to provide extra texture.  In addition, it was nice that they added smoked mozzarella to the burger, but I couldn't taste much smokiness nor much cheese although it was melted on the patty.  The veggies accompanying the burger were fresh and plentiful, including large slices of creamy avocado.  

The El Diablo burger I tried was better.  It was juicy, and cooked perfectly to order (Medium), and had great beef flavor from the burger and the spicy condiments.

So, going to Zinburger, if you're not a vegetarian, your best bet is to stick with the beef burgers, and be sure to get a yummy shake to go with your meal.  Your taste buds will thank you!",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

They brought us ice water and we ordered garlic naan.  In fact, we ordered a second basket of garlic naan before we even started with the first.  It was quite good.

The first part of the buffet had all vegetarian dishes.  Some of the standouts here were the  pakoras, large triangles filled with a spicy mix of vegetables, and the saag.  The saag had excellent flavorings and was very tasty.  I also tried some of the lentils and they were also good.

In the second section, I had some goat curry, chicken tikka masala, and tandoori chicken.  The chicken tikka masala was standard as was the goat curry.  The tandoori chicken was a bit dry.

Go up the wash a short distance and trail comes up out of the wash on the right.  At this point, you're still on the White Rock Loop Trail.

After a bit of uphill hiking, you'll come to a sign that points you to the Keystone Thrust Trail that goes off to the right. From here the trail is 2 miles round trip--an out and back hike.  As you first hike along, it will be a single track trail with lots of black bush and cacti.  After awhile, the trail becomes two lanes--remnants of the old road that was used for two reasons many years ago.  This was a ""chop shop"" place where stolen cars were brought for the parts and then abandoned.  The old road also led to some old mining area.

When you reach the high point behind Hogback Ridge, you can see the results of the thrust.  The older limestone is on top of the younger sandstone rock--the result of the Pacific Plate coming up and over the North Atlantic plate millions of years ago.

There is a use trail to the top of Hogback Ridge and you can see the south end of the Strip--Mandalay Bay, Luxor and the corner of Trop and the Boulevard.  There's also a great view of Red Rock Canyon from there.

However, parking was a total nightmare as the small private lot was full when we got here before the event officially opened and there was no way to loop around to exit. Instead, every car in line had to back out simultaneously with the hope you didn't crash into oncoming traffic. We ended up finding street parking to encounter a huge line that snaked out the door, around the corner, and almost around another corner on a 107 degree day. 

As I entered I thought the venue smelled really strange. It had a strong chemical smell to me which wasn't too pleasant especially combined with the body heat of a ton of other sweaty people walking around in an enclosed space.

There were some innovative, beautifully crafted, and just plain tasty desserts at the booths. My favorites were the desserts from Virtu, Sheraton at Wild Horse Pass, and Zak's Chocolates. After a while though my stomach got so sick of eating sugar that I didn't even want to try the desserts towards the back section of the event.

There wasn't a limit on attendance so we were packed in like sardines once we arrived. It was hard to get some samples, such as the beignets which were fried on the spot but caused a massive line so I decided to forgo this delectable dessert.

The drinks were heavy and strongly tasting of alcohol which, combined with the dehydration of waiting outside, made me sick after a few samples. They did have plentiful bottles of water available from Aquafina so I do appreciate that.

I sat at a high top table on the side so I could watch the people do their work at the grill and espresso machine.

In a short time, my sandwich and tea were on my table.  The sandwich came with some mixed greens with a little dressing.  The Moroccan is made with goat cheese, roasted tomatoes, roasted red peppers, and is topped with a North African spiced aioli.

Chaparral Dog Park is a bit of a distance from where I live but it had good reviews and I had always wanted to check it out with the dogs. After a recent health scare with one of my pups I wanted to take them out and celebrate their good health.

The entire park is huge and has multiple parking spots. I wasn't sure which area was for the dog park so I ended up initially parking further away than I would have liked. While there are signs posted sporadically throughout the park I couldn't find any posted maps to figure out where you were in relation to your destination. I ended up using my phone to find an online map to figure out where the dog park was. In general it is along the northern part of the park just south of McDonald.

Also, while the entire park itself is widespread and large I was a little disappointed at the actual size of the dog park. I do like how there is a separate section for passive dogs and another for active dogs. Whether an owner thinks their dog is passive when it is actually an active dog is another matter.

My pups are more chill so I took them to the passive side. There are maybe 2 areas of shade, not a lot of trees, and mainly a large grassy expanse in the center of the park. Towards the far end of the entrance there is a water fountain and a play area with sand and rocks for any intrepid dogs to climb or hop on. 

My dogs were doing OK until someone brought their pushy dominating dog into the passive side. Big annoyance on my part and we had to exit because the pushy dog wouldn't leave my dogs alone and it was causing quite a ruckus in the park. They were getting tired anyways and I was planning on heading back soon so we left to avoid doggie fight club. Not a fault of the park of course. I wish people would know their dogs enough to put them on the active side of the park instead of passive.

The other nice thing about this dog park is that there are two separate double gated points so that you can leave at the same time someone else is trying to get in and vice versa.

The Fudgery has various varieties of fudge, including some sugar-free varieties. The fudge is sold by the slice, and each slice is about 1/2 lb. At $15.98/lb., it's a little pricey, but a slice is quite sizable and can last for a lot of servings.

They currently have some specials, where you get a slice of vanilla fudge for free if you buy 2 slices, or you get to pick your own slice for free if you buy 3 slices. Some varieties include dark chocolate, chocolate peanut butter, pecan praline, chocolate caramel, peanut butter, and milk chocolate. They will give you free samples which is very helpful since each slice is so big, you don't want to get a flavor you can't snack on for a long time! I tried a variety of flavors, and preferred the dark chocolate flavor the most, followed by the chocolate caramel. I tried a sugar-free chocolate walnut fudge, which tasted good, but didn't have the same richness and depth of flavor as the sugary versions.

Service was friendly and cheerful. They are very good at trying to get you to buy more slices with their special deals though. I came in wanting just 2 slices and ended up taking home 4!",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
ycH2xauZBb7yqdp0d_T5Gw,4,2013-11-11,0,-gm40JArnd3yQKr_CeYdsA,4,"My main goal today was to ride this trail.  When I'be been in the area, I've seen the trail and I thought I'd bring my bike and park in the M Resort's garage and then bike the trail.  Instead, I changed my plans and biked two other trails to reach this trail.

I rode from Seven Hills Drive west to the trailhead and then rode it back to the Cactus Wren Park and then to the Cactus Wren Trail for the way back to my parked car.

This trail is really nicely done!  There are interpretive markers showing the animals of the desert you might see along the trail.  There are also a number of sculptures with these animals.  

There are several streets that go off to the south, but since this area is not growing right now, you can easily cross those streets with ease.  I agree with the other posters that there should be some kind of bridge over Eastern Avenue.  Although I didn't have any trouble crossing, I used the crossing lights and I was alert to drivers as I did.  I must say I saw several very courteous drivers who held back on their right turns to let me cross.

One things Henderson needs to do is mark the trails better.  Periodically there's a map of the trails near one of the entrances.  They use a color code which is often misleading because there are shades of the same color and it makes it difficult to distinguish one trail from the next.

This is an ideal walk or ride for a family.  I saw many out today enjoying the warm November weather and the day off from school.",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We had a beautiful view of the city at our table and got to watch the sun set while eating. Note that all the window view tables seem to be 4-tops so large parties will probably be seated more towards the center or the other side of the restaurant.

They are currently running a prix-fixe summer special. For $39.95 you get your choice of starter, entree, and dessert. The choices were varied enough that we could choose from the prix-fixe menu and be satisfied with our selections. I had the lobster bisque, stone fish, and ended the meal with a strawberry shortcake. I also sampled some of the short rib, bistro steak, and duck (Regular menu item). 

We started our meal with some complimentary bread and a selection of maple pepper compound butter, pepper sauce, and goat cheese spread. The goat cheese spread and the pepper sauce were excellent but I couldn't taste too much of the maple or pepper flavor in the compound butter. 

The lobster bisque was rich, creamy smooth, with a concentrated lobster flavor. It was superb.

The stone fish entree was a true delight. The fish had an even crispy sear on it with perfect tender succulent meat. It was perched on top of rice, mushrooms, shrimp, and onion. The colors, textures, and flavors meshed well with the delicate taste of the fish. The only negative was that the lobster soy mushroom broth was too salty for my tastes. The other dishes I tried were cooked to perfection.

Dessert was a delightful ""tres"" strawberry cake, with a trio of macerated strawberries and rhubarb, strawberry cheesecake ice cream, and strawberry sauce. We had an additional complimentary set of rich, luxurious chocolates with toffee(?) pieces in them. 

Service was impeccable. Thanks to Darren for helping to make our night wonderful!

The restaurant can be a little difficult to get to, since it's so high up the mountain and a lot of the road here is one way, steep, and narrow so drive with caution (Especially with all the touristy folk driving about). You have the option of valet or self-park.

One thing to note ladies: This is not a heel friendly venue, so walk with caution or prepare your footwear accordingly. The walkway, although beautifully designed, is made of natural rough stones which make for an uneven walking surface. Once you reach the restaurant you'll have a slightly steep flight of stairs to walk up before you meet the host/hostess.

Lovely indulgent little whoopie pies, now locally made!  We were in the area after dinner and were itching for some sugary sweets, so we headed to the Biltmore area to try out the Whoopie Baking Company.  Each pie is $3, and when we went there were 4 flavors to choose from.  I selected the ""pucker up"" whoopie pie (lemon filling, lemon cake), and tried the chocolate with salted caramel filling.  The pucker up had a light, lemon flavor, not too sour.  The chocolate with caramel filling was very rich.  While I enjoyed the chocolate cake more than the lemon because it was more moist and soft, overall I liked the taste of the lemon better.  

Service was very friendly, and I saw that they even offer Woofie pies for dogs... interesting.  If I am really in the mood to spoil my dogs rotten perhaps I'll buy them some delectable treats (After treating myself to pie for myself, of course!).",0,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

iIFMeiovZ2o7RzJ_1YYVww,29,2017-02-22,15,JyMqpjivVxPU85moodcMNA,4,"This is the type of food made by a sweet, loving Mexican grandmother. I know because my husband's nana makes the Sonoran version of this at her house :). The food represented at this restaurant reflects the Puebla region, and I was excited to see mole verde on the menu since I've typically only seen mole poblano at Mexican restaurants here. After browsing the menu, this is what I ultimately ended up with since I've never tried mole verde before. The menu is in English and Spanish but it does help to know some Spanish since there are a few descriptions on the menu that might be hard to decipher without a basic knowledge of it. 

We were first served some chips and tomatillo salsa. The chips were fresh and crispy while the salsa was tangy and went well with the chips. The mole was a generous platter with a heaping portion of rice, beans, with chicken thigh and leg. The sauce was wonderfully executed and paired with the chicken beautifully. I was a fan of the very flavorful rice and beans as well. The meal came with these delectable hand-made corn tortillas. They were soft, pillowy, and oh so good. You will never look at a store-bought corn tortilla in the same way again!

I washed everything down with a horchata which was sweet, ice cold and refreshing.

Service was friendly and the cashier spoke English and Spanish.

The only negative is that the restroom was absolutely disgusting. The toilet paper was off the roll holder and thrown haphazardly onto a dirty baby changing pad and the floors and wall were suspiciously stained. A bathroom shouldn't make you feel scared to touch the surfaces and things on or in it, especially the toilet paper!

Also, let's just say that this strip mall has a very well-worn feeling to it and the same can be said for the restaurant.

Note that they do accept credit card now but there's no option to add tip to your credit card bill so bring cash if you are going to tip.

Nelson and Sylvia Q. had been here before, so they suggested some of the dishes that we ordered.  I can't say there was a loser in the bunch but I liked some better than others.

The spicy shrimp were good but they weren't spicy.  There were some jalapeño slices on top but there was no  spiciness to the shrimp themselves.  The crispy Gau gee was a winner!  What great flavor in that fried goodness.  We mixed the Chinese mustard with soy and dipped the Gau gee in that.  Great!  The pressed Almond duck was another winner.  I love duck and this was great!  The Kow yuk - pork belly - was very good and was not as sweet as the look of the sauce suggested.  Putting a thick slab of the pork belly in a bao and eating was very tasty.

I've tried the maple bacon so far, and it's decent. The thick cut bacon is a little crumbly, so you have to be very careful taking the strips out of the package because they will tear easily. Cooking the strips was no problem, but it was harder to get a crispy strip. Mine ended up a little more chewy. The sweet maple flavor was a good complement to the salty smokiness of the bacon, although at the end I could taste a faint chemical aftertaste (Maybe a preservative?).

This show opened last year, closed for awhile when the Plaza had a dispute with a promoter of two other shows at the Plaza, and then reopened after that promoter's things were removed from the showroom.  The Phat Pack name comes from the fact that the three singers met while doing Phantom, the Las Vegas Spectacular and it's a play on words with the Rat Pack.  When Phantom closed, they decided to do this show and I'm glad they did.

Generally, it's three men, Randal Keith, Ted Keegan, and Bruce Ewing.  Ewing is out of town for awhile and they have gotten Rebecca Spencer, the original Madame Giry from Phantom, the Las Vegas Spectacular.  She filled in quite well.

The show revolves around the three singing together and in solo mode.  They tell some things about their lives and how they became entertainers.  Keegan did a superb Danny Boy along with some other songs including a very haunting I'll Be Seeing You by Cole Porter.  Keith's standout numbers were Bring Him Home from Les Mis and Is Anybody There from 1776.  The two sang a song written by a local composer called Men of a Certain Age which is quite funny and hits close to home for me.  Spencer's voice was very good and she was an able stand in for Bruce Ewing.

The three were accompanied by Philip Fortenberry, a very talented pianist that Las Vegas is lucky to have reside here.  He is superb!  He did a number that Liberace composed that's a great variation of Chopsticks.  If you saw the HBO movie ""Behind the Candelabra"" about Liberace, you saw Fortenberry's hands and sometimes his body playing the piano.

Course 4 was the last cold course.  It was called the tartare course and there was a salmon tartare in the center in a homemade ponzu sauce, yellowtail to the left, and a whitefish ceviche.

I first ate at a Garduños in Albuquerque in 2001 and I was delighted with their chile verde.  With the growth of Mexican restaurants on my side of town, the trip to Rancho and Lake Mead is not necessary anymore but I did miss that chile.

I had a small comp that could be used at Garduños so off I was in the rain halfway across town to enjoy this dish.

I was seated immediately--the place only had about 4 other occupied tables.  My server came over and dropped off chips and salsa and then went on his way (that became the story of my meal there) while I studied the menu which really wasn't necessary but it was worth a look.  It hasn't changed and I knew what I was getting.  My server returned and I ordered.  He asked me what style I wanted and I went with the diced chicken rather than the machaca version.  My iced tea was brought and then I waited.

I saw the bowl placed on the shelf in the kitchen but my server had a way of just disappearing.  I'm guessing it sat there at least five minutes before he sauntered in and got the bowl.  By the time I got it, the temperature heat had cooled a fair amount.  The chile was a bit spicy but I wanted some Cholula or Tapatio.  Server nowhere to be seen.  I eventually gave up, cut the whole chile in quarters, and used a quarter at a time to give some heat to the dish.

Bussers cleared my plates and then I waited.  Five to ten minutes passed before he returned and asked if I wanted dessert.  He got the menu and then disappeared again.  At least ten minutes later, he came back, put his hands on my shoulder and said, ""I keep forgetting you here.  Did you decide on dessert?""  I told him I was going to pass and he took my voucher and came back with the bill totaling $4.04.

At this point, I was so irritated that I was wondering what to leave for a tip.  I decided on $2, put it in the folder, and walked out.  It wasn't until I got home that I realized I stiffed someone for the small bill.  

I called and spoke to the manager and she said to forget it and apologized for the poor service.

Even with the two star rating, I will be back sometime.  I just will make sure I have a different server who doesn't forget me!",15,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

For main courses, my wife ordered their garlic stir fry with chicken.  It was just the way she likes it, lots of garlic and a good amount of chicken with some vegetables.  I ordered the soft shell crab in garlic curry sauce.  They didn't ask me about a spiciness level and I didn't specify one.  It was a mild curry, but it was very good.  The crab was on top of asparagus and some yellow squash and zucchini.  The presentation of both dishes was very good.

For dessert, I tried the custard-Thai style.  It's more like a piece of bread pudding.  It was very flavorful and quite enjoyable.  My wife got some green tea ice cream.

In addition to coffee drinks they have lemonade and tea. I was hungry and also wanted an iced coffee so I stopped by and ordered an iced mocha with almond milk and a breakfast burrito. The breakfast burritos allow you to choose your meat, cheese or no cheese, and sauce (Garlic tomato, chipotle, or basil). I went with a turkey breakfast burrito with egg, cheese, and chipotle sauce. 

The mocha came out first and the coffee was smooth and went well with the almond milk. The pumps of chocolate syrup added to the richness of the latte. For next time though, I will probably get it with no syrup and add a small amount of sugar or honey since the coffee is high quality and I don't need any extra flavor to hide it. 

Since this place is primarily a coffee shop, I wasn't really expecting much with the burrito. It was a strange concoction to me, but since this isn't Los Favoritos hey what do you expect. The turkey was sliced deli meat with slightly tough eggs, and the whole burrito was grilled in a panini press. Panini breakfast burrito? There's a first time for everything!

The menu describes the bowl in this way:  Chicken and vegetables, slow-cooked in our scratch made coconut curry, served over steamed white or brown rice with our fiery carrot slaw.  The carrot slaw was not fiery to my taste but it did have some red pepper sesame oil poured on the carrot thins and it was very good.  You have the option of white or brown rice and I chose brown.  The curry chicken had a good curry flavor and the serving size was very generous.

Throwing caution to the wind (when don't I?) I ordered dessert--the Simms Family S'more.  The menu describes it thusly:  ...this house favorite is made with layers of rich chocolate fudge, graham cracker crust, peanut butter and warm brownie, topped with a giant, fire-roasted, housemade marshmallow and crushed peanuts.

The s'more was OK but I'd get a different dessert the next time.  The chocolate was very good but the marshmallow was a bit of a challenge.  Since it's one thick piece of marshmallow, you have to attack it with your spoon, hold it up off the dish, and wait for the lower part to slowly drop away.  It was a bit of a challenge using just the spoon.  It was tasty but I never like fighting with my food.

The only thing I thought after 3/4 of the way through the show was that I was seeing a re-run with different costumes and different songs.  Nevertheless, the show was very well done.  

The dancing is sexy and seductive in the true sense of burlesque.  Somewhere along the way, people got the idea that burlesque meant stripping and it does not.  The dancing is suggestive, but that's what burlesque is.

One minor criticism I have of the show was the lighting at times.  It seemed like the lights were fixed and if a dancer strayed from a certain mark, they were no longer lighted well until they moved from the darker area back to the spot.

The previous reviewer mentioned that no swear words were used.  Yes indeed, there was a bit of dropping of words by the comedienne, Kathleen Dunbar.  I love Ms Dunbar.  I've seen her do stand up in comedy clubs in las Vegas.  She's very funny and she provides a bit of an interlude twice in the show for the dancers to get a breath, change costumes, and change e the minor scenery in the show--scenery consisting mostly of chairs and pedestals.

They also serve posole and menudo. The first time I went here I had a shrimp burrito. It was a gigantic burrito, but it didn't taste that great to me. It was a little bland, and the lettuce in it was juxtaposed with hot refried beans which made it soggy/wilted the more I ate it. The second time, I tried a bacon breakfast burrito. It was also a gargantuan burrito, but it was lacking in a few ways. First of all, the burrito had pieces of eggshell littered throughout it providing an unpleasant crunch as I ate. Also, the bacon wasn't very crisp and tasted slightly undercooked before it was placed in the burrito, so I got fatty chewy pieces as I ate.

The interior is a bit hot, and there's not much A/C in the restaurant.

They have a soda fountain here, but you could only get ice from it. Instead, they sell soda by the can, but if you want a Styrofoam cup to drink it in, they will charge you $.59 for it. They also have horchata, which I thought was pretty tasty. It was creamy and refreshing.

My wife liked her Smoked dog.  The slaw and garlic mayo were very good.  The Euro fries were tasty too.

I was seated immediately off the bar area in a room that cut off much of the noise from the happy hour crowd at the bar.

I was soon brought a small basket of house sourdough bread and two rounds of soft butter with spiced oil and vinegar--more vinegar that oil.  It was OK but the spices didn't add to the flavor that much.  I do appreciate soft butter like this that hasn't been just taken out of a sub-zero freezer and you have to use and ice pick to separate it and try to spread it on your bread.

I was brought iced tea quickly and a glass of water although not requested.  The server had a few specials to go over with me and then he let me look over the menu to decide.  When he returned, I ordered the kurobuta squash soup--the soup of the day--and the 14 ounce strip steak with bone on ordered blue.  I had a choice of mashed or rice and I went with the mashed.

When the soup was brought, he brought the pepper mill and ground fresh pepper to my taste.  The soup was good.  Nice chunks of squash rather than having it blended into a purée.  

The steak came at a proper interval from the time I finished my soup--read, I had enough time to check Facebook and have another piece of bread.  The steak was cooked the way I wanted.  It had char on both sides but was very rare on the inside, just the way I like my steak.  I wish I had a choice of a baked potato or fries instead of mashed or rice.  Steak and mashed potato doesn't make it as well in my book.  The small amount of vegetables was just perfect.  I didn't have to buy a side that would serve 3 people and left room for dessert.  

I looked over the dessert menu and I went with their rumchata bread pudding.  It was very good.  The bread was soft and had a nice cinnamon flavor from the topping.  There was no taste of rum which was OK with me.  It baked away and didn't leave flavor behind.

I asked my server, who was quite good, what recommendation he would have between the 8 oz filet and the macadamia nut encrusted sea bass. He recommended the sea bass and that's what I ordered.  The plating was done nicely, but I do have a dislike for things piled on top of each other.  If I want my beans and potatoes mixed, I'll do it myself.

A couple of things to note:  The macadamia nut crust was so finely chopped that it was impossible to get a taste of macadamia.  A little more coarse chop, please;  second, the fish was moist and tasty, but I don't think it was sea bass--at least like no other sea bass I've had.  It had more of a look, texture, and taste of haddock.  Was this a substitution?  Last, there was a bone in the fish.  Now I know, fish have bones.  But, for a moment I felt like Geoffrey Zakarian or Alex Guarnaschelli on Chopped and I wanted to turn up my nose and say the chef needed to be chopped.  Redeeming feature follows.

The dessert of Mud Pie was superb!  I should have had this for dinner and skipped the fish.  The chocolate ice cream with the cookie crumb crust was heavenly.  The other redemption came in the form of my server.  When informed I was using a Groupon, he told me approximately how much I had used and suggested ordering more to get the full value.  Now, that's service!

I'm not sure if I'd return here.  I think I know now why the other places all had a lot of folks and this relatively large restaurant had few diners.",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The Shimmer Showroom in the LVH is a small theatre and it lends itself very well to this kind of show.  No one is more than 25 feet or so from the stage.  That's how I found out I was wrong about the percussion track.

One of my favorite parts of the show was when four of the five came to the front and did their own solo ""instruimental"" -- one playing electric guitar, one bass, one harmonica, and one doing trombone.  They were quite talented and this really showcased their talent.

I had seen the group when they opened for George Wallace and when they did a number or two at the Ribbon of Life two times.  Seeing their entire show, which lasts just over one hour, gave me a chance to see their talent in full.

A friend joined me here for dinner last night before the Human Nature Show and we both ordered from the Restaurant Week menu.  For the first course, my friend ordered the Satay chicken with peanut sauce.  I got the ""crunchy spicy yellowtail roll with spicy mayonnaise."" We both enjoyed our dishes.  We didn't try each others dishes because Paula doesn't eat sushi and satay chicken is just satay chicken.  I did try the peanut sauce and it was good.

For course two, Paula got the roasted Thai Buddha chicken with choy sum, sweet chili, and lime.  I got the filet mignon pepper steak with shitake mushroom, bell pepper, and shishito peppers.  I did have some of the Buddha chicken and it was very tender and the sauce was excellent.  The pepper steak was very good.  The filet was sliced and barely stir fried with the vegetables.  The stand out was the sauce again!  It was rich and very flavorful.

For dessert, we again took different paths.  Paula got the crispy Fuji apple blossoms with Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream and I got the chocolate spring rolls
 with Kalamansi dipping sauce.  The rolls were good but they weren't stuffed with chocolate as I hoped they would be.  Rather, there was some melted chocolate on a leaf and the rolls were placed on the chocolate.  Regardless, they were good.  The dipping sauce was non-descript.  I really couldn't say it had much of a flavor.  It tasted more like mango than orange.  For Paula's apple blossoms, they were triangle puff pastries with apple filling.  They were good.

Service was very good.  My iced tea was refilled when it got halfway down.  The table was bussed quickly.  Our server was very pleasant and he was pleased to know there was at least one local having dinner at Tao.

The room is quite nice.  Dark and woody with a large Buddha in the center along one wall.  We got our cameras/phones out so we could get a photo of it.  It would be a good place to take a date if you wanted to impress.

After seeing the show last night, it's easy to give him 5 stars.  Moreno is an excellent performer, a man skilled in putting on a good show and highlighting his many talents.  He also has a band backing him up that's simply superb!  Nine member sin the band and they blow the roof off the room.

Much of Moreno's music is unknown to me because it's music he and his brothers have written.  The show varies from rock to ballad, to Jerry Lee Lewis-like banging the keys on the piano.  If Moreno wasn't so talented, I'd say he was showing off, but he simply is an excellent piano player.  In addition, in one number he has a bit of a drum duet with his drummer.  In a couple of songs he plays guitar.  He sings very well, a strong voice with excellent enunciation!

It's a nice place to bring a coffee and pastry and sit and enjoy the view of the sandstone cliffs of Red Rock Canyon and the limestone mountains that make up this section of the Spring Mountains.

That being said I can't fault the arts center for being what it is, but whenever I'm here I get a weird feeling of deja vu for a location that used to be his business, but has a totally different air and purpose now.

The actual concept is excellent. They host several events throughout the year and have art exhibitions, shows, and classes you can take. The theaters the shows are in are nice with comfy seats and I generally haven't had too much of a problem being able to see the stage.

This is what I like about these two guys.  They always do different things so the show is a combination of older favorites and newer illusions.

And, if you go now, you get a chance to hear Teller speak--sort of--but then I guess you'll have to go and see the show for yourself!  These guys are good.

This is an increasingly popular event in Gilbert. You can sign up for a class online and when I tried to get tickets weeks in advance there was only one time slot available. We went during the ""pink moon"" goat-ga session in the evening and experienced an hour of yoga poses, photos and most importantly, hanging out with cute goats!

Be aware that this place is really far south in Gilbert. It's where all the farmland still exists in the area. It took me about 45 minutes from Phoenix driving with rush hour traffic. The ranch is a private residence so in the interest of privacy they will send you the address to the ranch a day before your class.

I will admit that not much yoga was done by the humans I was with nor by myself. The goats got a good workout though! They will jump on your back if you are in the right pose and the instructors tried to have good photo shots of each person with a goat. The goats were dressed in all sorts of fun outfits and there were even some tiny baby goats! Cute overload for sure.

The cost is very reasonable. I paid $12 plus a service fee so it ended up being a little less than $14.

One thing to note is that since it's outside and on farm property with lots of lush grass, there will be bugs! Bring your mosquito spray if you are a bug magnet.

I understand the problems some people have gaining access to this trail.  It's easiest for people coming from the east side and coming up to Rampart, crossing the street, going north a brief distance, and then continuing west along a fence separating the Angel Park Golf Course from the trail and the Suncoast.

I ride my bike and I'm usually coming from the west so getting to the Alta trailhead is no problem for me.  If the gate is open as I head east, I skip the sidewalk section along Rampart and ride the golf course maintenance path that goes under Rampart.  I've had employees wave and say hello to me so it must be OK with them.  For now, that's the only way to do the trail because the sidewalk is closed and fenced off with the new gray water pipeline work being done along Rampart and Alta.

My favorite part of the ride is entering just east of Rampart and riding like the wind to Durango.  It's a hoot and a nice trail.  From the Westcliff Transit Center, you can ride the north side of the catch basin to the Bruce Trent Park or you connect with the Bonanza Trail that runs east through the Charlie Kellogg and Joe Zaher Sports Complex by going north on Durango to the entrance on the north side of the Summerlin Parkway along Washington.

However, the carpet was dirty and there was a large stain on the floor. How do I also know that the floor was dirty and that they didn't really vacuum?

I used one Kleenex tissue in the room before the box ran out. I went to the front office with the empty box to switch it out to encounter no one manning the front nor any means of buzzing or ringing for service. I had to yell ""Hello?!"" awkwardly and loudly to the back room to get anyone to come to the front. When I asked for a new box the attendant couldn't find any new tissue boxes and had to give me the already used front desk tissue box.

I wanted to try something different for the entrée, so I ordered the Fesenjan, a dish the menu describes in this way: Finely chopped walnuts stirred into pomegranate molasses with chicken (cooked for 12 hours).  The dish was very good and was something entirely different.  There is a sweetness to it from the pomegranate molasses but there's also a tang to the dish.  A wedge of white onion was served and I sliced this in small pieces to mix with the fesenjan to take away some of the sweetness of the dish.  The chicken cubes were fork tender and the rice with the chicken and fesenjan sauce was really good food.

I opted for some Persian style baklava for dessert.  It was very good and like almost everything they serve, made in house.

Service was excellent.  My being there was appreciated by the pleasant way I was treated during the meal and when I opted to pay at the pick up window if you've ordered take out.  The chef thanked me from the kitchen for stopping in.

The burger was juicy, with a hefty amount of toppings. It had an excellent grilled, slightly smokey flavor. The bulgolgi was nice, but I didn't see or taste much of it (Maybe the other stronger ingredients drowned out the bulgolgi flavor). Out of all the toppings for the burger, I was slightly disappointed in the coleslaw. I would have liked more tangy flavor to add to the burger, but it was just a minor flaw. The hot dog was good as well, with a combination of strong flavors complementing each other with each bite. The angry kimchi fries were my favorite item that we ordered. It was a huge portion of sweet potato fries, kimchi, bulgolgi, peppers, cheese, onions, and a fried egg on top. The combintation of sweet, sour, spicy, and creamy was amazing. 

This isn't healthy eating here in general, but they do have vegetarian options such as veggie dogs that can be substituted for any hot dog item on the menu.

Service was very friendly. Definitely a good place to get fast-food Asian fusion!",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The toast was crisply browned and had syrup over the pieces and some banana slices.  It was very good!  The two pieces of sausage were good, but they needed more time heating.  They were luke warm.

The staff was great!  Fast, efficient, and with great attitudes.  This little gem is hidden away on Valley View in the warehouse and office area.  Had it not been for Yelp and an ad in a mailer from DiVine, I would never know this place existed.

Edit:  I have to edit this review to add that this is way too much for one person for breakfast!  The French toast consisted of three thick slices of grilled bread.  It's enough to make two people happy, and I was sorry I wasn't going home so I could have them pack the pieces I couldn't finish instead of having it tossed.

Six of us decided to meet for lunch yesterday and it would give me the chance to try the Hainan chicken about which I've read so much.

We were served everything on the menu.  As it only contains 5 things plus a few à la carte items, everything was enough and very good.

We started with fried chicken bao with kale pea sprout slaw.  The chicken was excellent, breaded just right, and with the slaw and the soft bao, it made one great sandwich.

Next came two orders of chicken wings--one of Thai caramel and one called Mystery wings which are Szechuan style wings.  I had one of each.  I liked the Szechuan wings better but I'm not a chicken wing fan.  Generally when I order wings, I get boneless wings which aren't wings at all.  It's the messy fingers syndrome I don't like.

Then we were served a Flock & Fowl salad with Cornish game hen pieces.  I had some salad but I didn't try the hen.  

Last, we were brought two dishes--one with the Hainan poached chicken for which this place has become known and one with fried chicken tenders and rice.  Both dishes come with three sauces, ginger scallion, house made chile, and house made soy.  Both dishes come with rice and marinated cucumbers and preserved mustard greens.  The Hainan chicken comes with a cup of broth.  These dishes are excellent!!  The Hainan chicken is moist and delightfully boneless and the dipping sauces add to the taste of the chicken.  The tenders are excellent!

This is a must return to place.  The bao, the tenders, and the Hainan chicken are all worthy of having again!  

A couple of tips:  this is a lunch only restaurant open from 10:30-3:30.  It's a small place seating just 16 people so you may have a wait.  This is in a small strip mall on West Sahara near the freeway on the north side of Sahara.

_WtxQbDK7B-ExGdeG-2j6Q,9,2015-12-25,7,kcWTyFnqiB-FRexfyScKMw,3,"Was unfortunately disappointed in our dining experience here. The menu has a good mix of Southwestern food, with some European dishes like schnitzel thrown into the menu. There is also a separate menu on the chalkboard which includes steak and seafood. I had the sea bass with roasted cauliflower and tried some rack of lamb with Brussels sprouts. 

The portion of food was good, but when I received my food my first thought was ""This is it? I paid $39 for this?"" The food looked like it was dumped on my plate with no special thought on plating and was simply breaded fish and cauliflower. Now this is fine if I'm getting an informal casual meal but for the price a little panache or maybe more elements in the dish would be nice so I feel like I'm eating something that looks better and more varied than what I could eat at home. The sea bass was breaded and crusted with pine nuts, and covered in a sweet sauce. I couldn't remember what the sauce consisted of and it tasted too generically sweet for me. It needed some acid to balance out the flavor and I used a lemon wedge on an iced tea glass to squeeze some juice on the fish which made it taste a lot better. The cauliflower was well prepared and had some nice caramelization along the edges from roasting. 

I tried some lamb too ($39) which was perfectly medium rare, but could use just a touch more seasoning. It had a smoky flavor which was nice.

Since we were the lone table in the corner next to the bar, our waiter was actually the bartender. He did a good job though helping the bar patrons while serving and refilling our drinks. Note that sodas are by the bottle but iced tea has unlimited refills.

Overall while I thought the food was OK, it was very overpriced for what you get. Also note that the parking here seems to be strictly valet (Although complimentary).

I do love the atmosphere here though, with the dark wood, the dim lighting, excellent music (A mix of artists from Santana to Beck), and the lush, comfortable seating.

P.S. For those that are wondering (I definitely was before I came here!) it's pronounced ro-ker-ee and it means ""smokehouse"" in Dutch.",12,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The restaurant is a bit small and has only a few tables but the interior is warm, cozy and contemporary. The menu has some of your old standards such as pad Thai and drunken noodles but also has some more unique dishes you won't find at your average Thai restaurant. Note that unlike other Thai restaurants, most of the selections here come with a protein already picked out with the dish rather than having you choose what you want. As a result there aren't a lot of vegetarian options since most of the dishes have some sort of meat in them unless you make a special request.

We started with the fresh rolls, and I had an item off the chef's special menu, the pla rad prik (Fried tilapia with bell pepper in chile sauce). The fresh rolls had a mixture of crisp vegetables, soft noodles, and warm peanut sauce. The pla rad prik was a hefty dish, comprised of two large pieces of tilapia covered in a sweet sauce with diced bell peppers. The tilapia was fried to a light crisp and the fish itself tasted good. The sauce wasn't too spicy; it was more on the mild side to me. I liked the crunch of the bell pepper with the sauce and the crisp fish. As I ate more bites though the more I got tired of the one-dimensional sweetness of the sauce. 

I had a Thai iced tea with my meal which was served in a mason jar. It was refreshing but a bit too sweet for my tastes.

Dessert was a lovely mango sticky rice. It was such a nicely done presentation, with the perfect mango slices wrapped in a floral pattern, with a heart shaped mound of coconut milk infused rice to go with it. The sweet mango went well with the creaminess and salty-sweet flavor of the rice.

Service was friendly and we were checked on as needed.

We had a good time here and it's a cute little place to get Thai food. I'll be back!

Other than the chicken adobo, I honestly don't know the names of the other items we ordered, but one of them was a pork belly dish with shrimp paste, another was a clear noodle dish.  The flavors in the entrees are strong, and for the most part, I really liked them.  The pork dish with shrimp did start to lose its appeal halfway through though, as I started to get tired of the strong seafood taste in the background.  The chicken adobo was probably my favorite.  It had a hint of more vinegar than other adobos I've had, which I thought gave it a little more extra flavor.

They have an excellent deal for happy hour, which is all day from Monday-Thursday, and from 11:30-5 on Friday and Saturday. Nigiri sushi and rolls are 1/2 price. The happy hour menu for sushi is pretty extensive, and a lot of specialty rolls are included. The rolls themselves are a large portion of fish and vegetable. The quality is pretty good, especially for the price.

We ordered 6 different rolls and left very full. Even the basic rolls such as tuna and salmon have a lot of fish in them and are pretty large, compared to other sushi restaurants where your basic rolls have a tiny amount of fish, and are pretty anemic looking compared to others. We had 2 deep fried rolls with jalapeno, and they were perfectly crispy, with a nice spicy kick to them from the fresh pepper. We also tried a deep-fried chicken roll since it sounded like a pretty unusual roll. It was also delicious, with panko-crusted chicken wrapped in rice and seaweed.

I had looked at the menu online and decided on the kebab trio--a dinner with koobideh, chicken, and lamb kebabs.  Served with the meal are vermicelli pilaf, basmati rice, a house salad, and grilled tomato and red pepper.

I started my meal with a cup of their summer soup available for a limited time.  It's a cucumber yogurt cold soup with walnut pieces and golden raisins for a touch of sweetness.  The soup was topped with some croutons and garnished with a sprig of mint.  It was excellent!  Very different and very refreshing.

For the main course, the kebab trio was perfect for the two of us.  My wife does not like lamb.  By sharing the trio, I was able to have some lamb while she stuck with chicken and koobideh.  Of the three, the koobideh was the star of the dish.  The lamb was cooked too much--I had requested rare and it was more on the medium side.  It was also a bit tough.  The chicken was OK but there wasn't much spice to it.  The koobideh, on the other hand, was done medium rare as I asked and it was flavorful and very enjoyable.

For dessert, my wife got the rice pudding (it was very good), and I got an order of baklava--also very good.

Service was not the best.  We waited at the podium for about 5 minutes before anyone came to seat us.  My iced tea wasn't refilled in a timely manner and even though there were only a few other diners in the room, our server seemed to disappear for long periods of time only checking back with us once near the end of our dinner.

Bugsy's Cabaret in the Flamingo Hotel is near the front of the casino.  It is a small, intimate theatre seating roughly 150 people in a semi-curcular seating arranegement.  Bugsy's Cabaret is hime to several shows including X Burlesque, Piff's Piffmas Pifftacular, X Comedy, and Jeff Civillico.  The lineup changes from time to time with X Burlesque being the show that is the main one in the theatre.  I have seen a number of shows in the theatre and find it a pleasant showroom.

There are two lines outside the theatre--one for VIP guests and one for regularly ticketed people.  I came here to see X Comedy that was to begin at 8.  Rather than standing in line, I waited in the casino watching tourists and went to the line when it was shorter at about 7:45.

I arrived at Sweets Raku at about 7 last night and I was the only customer for about 10 minutes.  I chose the prix fixe 3 course dessert menu along with a pot of peach tea.  I sat at the bar because I wanted to see the pastry chefs doing their thing up close.

For the three course prix fixe, you only have 1 choice--the second dessert.  The first, the amuse, and the last, the petit four, are fixed depending on the day and season.  For the first course last night, the amuse was an oval of mango sorbet with blue ice as Yuka, my server, described it to me.  It was mint jelly on the mango sorbet and it made a good pairing of flavors.

Course two I chose.  I had read the Yelp reviews and I was sure I'd go with the Mt. Fuji.  Yuka told me the Ringo (apple pie) was made that day and was excellent.  I finally decided on the Baton which was a tall thin chocolate mini-tower with chocolate and pistachio mousse and some fresh mango cubes.  It was excellent.  It was a little tricky to eat because I tried to peel a piece of the very thin chocolate tower to dip in the mousse but the tower is so fragile, it sometimes breaks away.  Regardless, it was tasty and lots of fun.

Course three, the petit four, was a delicious parmesan cheesecake with tangerine pieces.  The cheesecake was excellent.

None of the desserts was sweet which was very appealing.  It's not that I don't like sweet--it's just that it isn't needed in every dessert.  

Service was excellent!  Yuka was a gem. We did have a bit of a language problem but then I don't speak Japanese and she speaks English.  Do yourself and sit at the bar and watch the ladies work magic with preparing these delightful pastries!

I opted for the gift card, and stopped by once or twice in that month, but didn't find anything that I quite liked, or was in my size. 

Sometime in 2013, they closed up their physical location in Tempe and had an online-only website, listing their business on Facebook. I was not given any notice that they were moving, and like another reviewer mentioned, there was no sign indicating where we should find them now. I did know about the online site (Only because of the owner's response to a review here), so I messaged them about items they had in stock. I got a brief response to one of my inquiries, but they did not respond to any other inquiries I had about any other items.

That was a year ago. Since then, I'm assuming that they went out of business. I am unable to find their Facebook page anymore, and upon searching for their number on google, it now seems to be a freight trucking company. 

This was an unfortunate instance of ""seller beware"", as I lost out on a good chunk of money by opting for the gift card/seller credit. I understand that it can be hard for a small business to make ends meet, but the lack of communication about the loss of their physical store, and the items they had in stock so I could use my credit has left a bad taste in my mouth and more wary to support similar businesses through store credit.",0,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We had a large table with comfortable chairs to hold our books and our drinks.  There were enough chairs and tables that we could have added more space if more readers had attended.

The only drawback was getting the drink I wanted which is an important thing.  I ordered an iced mocha and the young man behind the counter had this blank expression on his face of, ""What?""  Eventually, he got the manager/owner(?) who was seated with some people with whom it appeared he was discussing business.

My drink was eventually ready and it was tasty.  A bit more pricey than some competitors, but good nonetheless.  The same routine played out during the evening as more people came in.  An order was placed, a blank look ensued, and the manager had to come over and help with getting the drink done.  It was a hoot!

The menu at Skinnyfats is divided into Happy Eats and Healthy Eats.  So of course I looked immediately at the happy side, skipping the healthy side, and I ordered their Bonjour Brulée, which the menu describes as ""9 grain bread dipped in our egg white signature crème brulée mixture, pan fried and drizzled with agave nectar.""  It comes with three slices of applewood smoked bacon.  There was no whipped cream as Nelson had, but it really is not needed.

You order at the counter, sit anywhere, and then one of the nicest young women brings your coffee or other drink and food to your table.  The French toast was wonderful. The agave syrup was only needed a tiny bit, and the fresh berries were the perfect topping.  The coffee was good.

While waiting, I took a bunch of photos and just enjoyed the place.  Whoever came up with the theme and the decorations was very creative and imaginative.  I want to use the word cute, but I don't like using the word cute in general.

This is an out of the way place but I can see where they would do a good business from all the businesses in the area.  I wlll be back.  This is a place to try over.  Lunch next time!  This is a place to bring out of town guests for breakfast.  They'll love it.

It has moved from the LVH Hotel to the Inspire and Scullery Theatres, part of the Downtown Project.  I sent a correction to Yelp HQ and they changed the URL but not the location.  Go figure!

This would get 4 stars from me but for several hopefully first time problems.  One, the times listed on the schedules are merely guides to what the actual time will be.  I believe that only one of eleven screenings I did started with 5 minutes of the actual scheduled time.  There were a number of problems with equipment.  At the Scullery Theatre, one film had to be restarted 3 times before they corrected the problem with the narration track being audible.  We saw the first five minutes of the movie 4 times and it was Groundhog Day.  At the Inspire Theatre, a DVD player had to be changed out because it stopped working properly.  I hope this is first timer problems but one would think the staff would be trained with the equipment before the festival.

With screenings occurring only in 2 theatres, there are no films that are repeated during the five days so choose wisely.  I started to compare this to CineVegas which was at the Palms and had multiple screenings of each movie.  I had to rethink how I did a film festival with these limitations.  Also, the distance between the two theatres is two long blocks.  But since the schedule is only a guide, you shouldn't be late for any screening.

I found the staff, both programmers and volunteers, to be very friendly and helpful.  Make sure that you use the scheduling program at the website.  When you build your schedule, it also creates an RSVP for you and you will be on the list if they have both a general admission and a VIP line.

I look forward to attending again next year and I hope I can upgrade my rating.",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

All of us opted for Great Wraps.  I stayed to watch our things at the tables and when some came back with their breakdfats from Great Wraps, I decided to go there too.

The breakfast special was $4.99 and consisted of 2 eggs any style, 2 bacon slices or sausage links, a bagel, and some hash browns.  The order was done in about 2 minutes.

The eggs were cooked as asked-over easy.  The sausage was standard and the hash browns were a oblong patty that was briefly deep fried.  The breakfast came with cream cheese for the bagel but it wasn't buttered.

The breakfast was OK.  A couple of things stand out.  In the need to be fast food, the bagel was only toasted a little.  I don't want it black but neither do I want most of the bagel to be just off white toasted.  Also, the hashed brown patty could have been fried a little more.

It had been awhile since I had been here prior to last Sunday.  They have redone part of the interior to break up the large expanse of tables.  Now, they have several quad booths in the main eating area.  The booths have for separate seating areas for up to 4 people - perhaps more.  It breaks up the room and gives you and sense of privacy instead of the large open area.

I have to agree with some of Kyle's comments about service.  Service has been spotty depending on the server one gets.  We had Pat, a lovely, petite Asian woman who is a competent person.

In general, you get a fair value for what you pay for.  For instance, the $1.95 taco was really not that good.  The taco juices had all leaked through one side of the taco, making it impossible to pick up so I had to eat it with a fork and knife.  The fish itself didn't seem too fresh, and actually tasted fishy.  But for $1.95, what do you expect?  On the other hand, the more expensive mussels for $3.95 were very tender, in a light white wine/garlic broth that complimented the mussels well.

We ordered a variety of dishes, from pizza, to a remarkable seafood platter, to pasta. I ordered the black pasta. The pasta itself is hand made fresh, with the addition of squid ink to give it its signature dark color. I was excited to try this dish out since I've never had squid ink pasta before, and I was impressed. The pasta was cooked perfectly, with a slight salty, deep briny flavor. It went well with the sauce, langostinos, and scallops. I also tried some of the margherita pizza, which was superbly executed with a thin, crispy crust and lovely toppings. I also tried part of a meatball which was perfectly seasoned, with a delightful soft texture. My friend that had the impressive seafood platter (Lobster, clams, scallops, and possibly more!) enjoyed his meal overall, but did remark that the clams were gritty.

He asked if we wanted him to just send out dishes, put them in the center of the table, and enjoy them family style.  We agreed to that.  Some table leaves were raised so we had more room for the 5 of us with plenty of room in the middle for our dishes.

We were given bread service and instead of butter, we were served this very tasty garlic creamy spread that was very good.  

In short order, we started with the appetizers.  We got eggplant parmigiana, calamari which contained some fried peppers and tomatoes and was served with a very spicy, very good tomato sauce.  We also got a platter of mozzarella that contained burrata, stracchino, bufala mozzarella along with two kinds pf prosciutto and some Italian tomatoes.

This was shortly followed by some meatballs in tomato sauce and a focaccia pizza which had mozzarella, crème fraîche, smoked salmon, chives, and red onion.  

Moving on to the entrée type plates, we got this huge--think the size of a large round pizza--bone in veal chop parmigiana.  The menu lists it as 12 ounces, but it had to be a lot more than that.  It was huge!  We also got osso buco with pappardelle and vegetable stew.  Accompanying these two dish were a lasagna and seafood risotto.  

We ended with four desserts--tiramisu, pear ricotta tart,  pannetone bread pudding, and baba au rhum.

Standout dishes for me were the calamari and the hot tomato sauce.  There was a lot of red pepper in the sauce and it had great zing to it.  The mozzarella platter with prosciutto was another good dish.  The osso buco was good and the pappardelle and sauce from the osso buco was very tasty.  The pounded veal parmigiana was good but I'm not that big a fan of veal parmigiana.  I credit Chef Febbraro with not breading his dishes to death.  The calamari and veal were nicely breaded.  

I did not try the baba au rhum because one of my dining mates let me know it was infused heavily with rum.  The other three desserts were good with the pear ricotta tart being the best.

The amount of food we ate and the heaviness of the dishes filled us all.  It was a fine dinner with the chef sending out some of his chosen dishes.",8,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I have not had much experience with AYCE sushi--I've only been to one other sushi place for AYCE.  

We placed quite a few orders of various Nigiri sushi with some extra things like miso soup, shrimp tempura, and a few other things (I got a 4 piece Mexican roll).  The fish was fresh and tasty.  

Service was good.  There was a misstep or two when something ordered was not brought but given the amount we ordered, I guess I could expect this.  

My biggest issue with the place is that it is so small.  5 people at one table and with all the plates that were brought meant that our table was quite crowded.  This made for good conversation and sharing of what had been ordered, but I was amazed I didn't elbow one of my dining companions during the meal.

There is a 45 minute time limit for lunch and an hour for dinner but the way we scarfed everything down, we almost had time to spare although we weren't watching the time and I don't think they were either.

The red bean ice cream for dessert was very good.  I wish they had mochi on the AYCE menu.  Rather, they just had three ice cream flavors.

I will come back and sit at the sushi bar--my wife is a hater of fish (raw or otherwise)--and I'll do the AYCE.  Maybe I'll go slower and really enjoy the meal.",4,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag,14,2016-10-24,14,-TcFjK5bSkbyNwhZ7Lz9Bw,2,"This restaurant has been a long time in coming so the owners had plenty of time to decide on their business plan.  The latest of a trio of Indian restaurants, I think this one has an identity crisis.  Is it more of a bar in the Fremont East District that just happens to serve Indian food or is it a restaurant that prominently features a bar?

I entered about 10 minutes after it's 5 PM dinner hour opening.  I was shown to a table in the bar area.  Unlike other Indian restaurants, this one had the football game on TV instead of the normal Bollywood music with dancers.  That's OK with me though.  It's up to them.

When I looked at the menu I was surprised by how limited it was.  On the back was a list of traditional curries and to my memory they were all vegetarian options--again OK--but not what I was looking for.  I saw a sign out front that said the soup of the day was lentil soup (see my photo for the exterior shot and you'll see the sign).  When I asked the server about this, she pointed to an $11 lentil soup on the menu.  She then said she could have them make a cup size portion rather than the larger size.  Seeing nothing else I wanted on the menu, I opted for the beef curry and I ordered garlic naan.  I had already been brought the iced tea I asked for when I was first seated.

A server brought me a small Indian cake as an amuse but I couldn't understand his description.  (A Yelp friend let me know that this is dhokla made from chick pea flour.)   It was good with some nice Indian spices in the cake.  Then came the lentil soup.  It was a large bowl but it wasn't that deep which was OK.  However, I didn't see a lentil anywhere and I'd refer to it as lentil broth rather than lentil soup.  There was not even a texture of ground lentils in the bowl.  (Check my photo against the lentil soup photo someone else has posted and note the difference.)  

The beef curry came.  I had ordered it at spice level 4 out of 5.  If you like spicy food, order the 5 because this could have had more zing to it.  The curry was OK but nothing exceptional.  A serving of basmati rice came with the curry.  The naan was OK but needed more garlic.  My iced tea was refreshed without asking.

They have recently opened but there are a couple of things to note.  The lunch menu appears to have more of what I'd want than the dinner one.  When I asked my server if they had two menus, one for the bar area and one for the dining room area, she said no and brought me their lunch and their dinner menus.  Lunch has lamb rogan josh--something I would have ordered instead of the beef.  When I  pointed this out, she showed me the lamb rack that's on their dinner menu and said that could be made into rogan josh--just ask.  Really?  If I want curry chicken I have to guess that you'll make it for me.

As for the surroundings, this is where the Fremont East District comes into play.  There is a counter running along the windows of this corner restaurant with stools so people can sit at the counter and watch the people at the Container Park or just coming and going on Fremont Street.  Yesterday, all three garage door style windows were open.  One was shut when the west breezes were strong and almost blew the menu off the table.  The windows facing the Container Park remained open all the time I was there.  

I saw last December that this restaurant was coming in 2016.  It finally made it and I was glad to give it a try when I knew they were open.  My experience tells me that it's the one and only time I'll be there.  We have just too many better choices for Indian food without having to get beef.  You need to decide what kind of business you want Turmeric to be.  Note:  their website does not yet have a menu listing.",20,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I was excited to see koshari on the menu since I've only seen it on TV. I had heard that this Egyptian dish is a popular street food since it's fast, cheap, and filling. I wanted a little variety so I got the plate which includes a small side salad and one side dish with pita chips or bread. I had the spicy baba ganoush with pita bread. You get your spice preference on the koshari sauce too (Mild, medium, hot). I had the hot sauce.

The koshari was indeed quite hearty, filled with macaroni, rice, lentils, topped with a delicious tomato based sauce and caramelized onions. I liked the mixture of textures and flavors from the slightly crispy, sweet onions to the soft pasta. The heat level was just right for me. Although this was a vegan dish I didn't miss the dairy or meat at all.

The salad was crisp and refreshing, filled with romaine lettuce, feta, cucumber, tomato and dressing (I opted for no raw onion). The spicy baba ganoush wasn't as spicy as the sauce in the koshari and had too much of an overpowering acidic flavor to me. I did enjoy the smokiness of the eggplant though. The pita bread it was served with was fresh and hot but super oily.

My total for the koshari plate with tax was a little over $8.

I had just bookmarked the new business--yesterday was their second day open--when Shirley and Teri decided we'd go here after the UYE if we weren't too full.

We picked out what we wanted and took it to a large dining room type table with some fresh flowers for their grand opening.  I got a macaron that was filled with gif and goat cheese.  What a wonderful combination!  Light crisp outside shell and a smooth interior.  I also got a box of 6 macarons to bring home--maple bacon, s'mores, pumpkin, and Nutella.  I can't remember the other two but they look great and based on the one I ate last night, they will be good!!  The macarons are about 3 inches in diameter--more like the ones at Bouchon than other bakeries that sell them.

While we were having our treats and chatting at the table, the owner came around with a sample of their rich hot chocolate.  It was very good.

For those who have been to a movie or were out shopping, this is a nice place to stop and unwind a bit.  Order some wine and have a sweet.  The interior is very pleasant and the staff is great!  Considering this was their second day open, they did a great job when the seven of us descended on the place.  They're open late on Friday and Saturday.

I sampled a few of their items including a palaak/spinach dish, rasam, sambar, idli, cabbage curry, and tofu curry. Fresh dosa is made per table, and desserts include payasam and gulab jamun. 

Overall the buffet items were pleasing to the palate and satisfied my craving for Indian food without needing any meat. Most of the items today were vegan, with a smattering of vegetarian dishes. My favorites were the dosa, vegetable rice and the cabbage curry. The rice was flavorful, colorful, and had a lot of different vegetables in it. The rice was well cooked and tender. The cabbage curry had a coconut milk base which gave it a slight tropical flair and had a delicate flavor. The dosa was excellent, lightly crisp, with a wonderful potato mixture inside. Most of the dishes had a bold, spicy punch to them. The spinach dish was my least favorite since it was too salty for my tastes.

Service was exemplary. The host was friendly, very engaging and warm. They probably have some of the best service that I've encountered at an Indian restaurant.

The interior is spacious, with a lot of tables. The buffet was nicely presented and well organized. 

The buffet for a weekday (Not sure if the price changes on the weekends or if it offered then) was $9 and the total with tax came out to be slightly under $10. Not bad for a buffet!

Two of us were there a little earlier than the rest of the group and we had some sweets.  Soon the others had joined us and the parade of dishes began.  Each one so very creative and tasty.

We were served:

White chocolate French toast
PB&J pancakes
Parmesan broccoli tort with smoked salmon
Strawberry shortcake French toast
Egg Mac Kitchen
Avocado toast with poached eggs
Pork belly Bene
White chocolate French toast
Foie Mac Muffin

We thought we'd have the sweets first and then the savories but it turned out that many of the savories were sweet and oh so good!  There wasn't one dish that fell short.  Everything was on point and some of them seem like they come from a mind that says, ""What would happen if I put this on that and then served it in an English muffin with a side of greens.""

I was really taken by the avocado toast with the poached eggs.  What a different dish!  The two mac muffins were very good and definitely savories while the white chocolate French toast and strawberry shortcake French toast were delicious and perfect for the sweet tooth.  I can't end without mentioning the PB&J pancakes.  They were buttermilk pancakes with house peanut butter and house made jam. 

Service was excellent.  Clean plates and silverware were brought for each dish (which the 5 of us shared lest one think I'm truly a pig).  Coffee was continually refilled.  Speaking of which, they have outstanding, rich flavored coffee.

sE2oU0ERETgestAc91YOGA,9,2014-01-24,9,3NOv5wryGCCq-MNJZyWgrw,3,"I didn't know what to expect of the show before hand because I don't know Shania Twain's music.  I am not a fan of country but I had been told that the show was a wonderful production even if the music wasn't especially my type.

I sat in the first row of the rear orchestra near the sound booth, so I had a great seat.  The show started 8 minutes late--about standard for non-Cirque du Soleil shows so that was nothing to be upset about.  The first few numbers lulled me into thinking it was going to be a good show.  The Colosseum's LED screen was used well.  The songs also tended to sound more rock than country.  This was part I of the show.

Part II is where the show started going downhill for me.  Twain is very good getting out among the audience, pressing the flesh, getting hugs, and participating in selfies.  Yes, Virginia, they do allow cameras if she's there and you pull yours out for a shot with her.  She waded into the audience twice, and I suppose if you're a fan, this would be the sine qua non for the super Twainer.  In between the two forays into the audience, she did a campfire number on the stage with audience members--some pre-selected--but all from the special Twain lovers seating area in the first few rows.  She talked briefly with each of the audience members and then had them sit behind this faux campfire which had been burning during her talk with the folks on stage.  She sang two songs and asked the audience to join in with the second song.  This whole campfire bit was a big fail for me.

We then moved to the last part.  As she was changing, a forest appeared on the LED screen with a black horse.  A fire was burning in the forest and it seemed like the horse would be trapped, but he managed to make it out.  The fire is now out and it begins to snow and the horse changes from black to white.  Then Miss Twain rides out on a white horse.  It looked like the horse was standing on a padded area and had padded hoof coverings and she removed his sparkly lead.  She then sang her iconic, ""You're Still the One.""  Score for me--I know this song.  However, the horse loves this song too, and he soon showed very visibly how much he cared for Miss Twain.  The people in my area were snickering through much of the song and continued as she led the horse off stage at the end of the song.

The band came out and it almost sounded like they were going to end the show with a rousing rock number.  Nope!  She came back out and the show ended with two country numbers.

A couple of things that struck me about the show.  I love animals and while hiking today, I saw four wild horses in Red Rock Canyon.  The last thing an animal lover would think of would be having a horse in a fire.  I thought it was an awful premise and I wondered who thought it up.  I also wondered if Elton John left a Candle in the Wind on the stage and it set Miss Twain's forest on fire.  Second, one confetti drop is enough.  This show has three although one is supposed to be part of the snowstorm that changes the black horse white.  Third, the folksy bit wore thin quickly with me.  She may be a very folksy person but it seemed contrived.  Last, her voice is good, but not that good.  There were quite a few seats in the first and second mezzanines empty last night.  Is the market voting on her show?  This wouldn't be a show I'd see again unlike the other performers at the Colosseum.",10,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We got started with some rolls and a plate of cheese, zucchini crisps, and olives.  Some of our party wanted bread instead of the oil/balsamic dip and that was brought also.  One odd things was that when we said we didn't want to see a wine list, the wine glasses were removed but we were never asked about anything else to drink.  Instead we were served tap water which was fine but i do like iced tea with any meal.

I was the only one who ordered an appetizer.  I got their tortellini in brodo, chicken tortellini in chicken broth with parmigiano reggiano cheese.  In addition, a server added some freshly ground pepper and some extra cheese.  The soup was very hot and was very, very good!

For my main course, I got the ravioli di spinach, ravioli stuffed with spinach, ricotta, brown butter, and sage.  This, too, had extra cheese grated as I requested.  There were five good sized ravioli and the filling of spinach and cheese was quite good.  The brown butter made the dish even better tasting.

It's July 5th, and many places are closed, including my gym.  Off to Red Rock this morning hiking.  I parked in the lot where the horse trailers park at the exit from the Scenic Drive.  The hike starts from just inside the exit gate by the parking lot.

The trail was made by horse riders.  It heads toward the Potato Knoll, also known as Wilson's Pimple, the high mound at the base of Mount Wilson.  The trail goes across two dry creek beds, past some petrified wood, and around the back of the Knoll.  When you get to the back of the Knoll, you can take a side trail to the top of the Knoll and get a great view.

Follow the trail around the base of the Knoll and you can't get lost.  It's always good to have a GPS unit with you, and always bring plenty of water when you hike.  It's a desert out there, you know!

An alternative way of doing this hike would be to park at the Oak Creek parking area along SR 159 and hike back to the Knoll along the Oak Creek trail.  Circle the base of the Knoll and then head back.  

The hike is about 5 miles and it took me 2 hours.  There is an elevation gain of only about 150 feet.  It's very gentle.

The photos I have posted are the ones I took today.  If you have any questions about the hike, send me a message.

The film was very brittle and the last time I tried to view them on a movie projector, the lead of the film would break off and it just wouldn't work.  When I first moved to Las Vegas, I called a few companies and asked about doing this.  They responded with, ""Sorry, we can't handle 16mm film.""

I had gotten a recommendation from a guy who hikes with our group.  He was very pleased with the slide to DVD transfer they did for him.  I called Pathcin to see if they did 16mm films and the answer was yes.  I was off to their place with high hopes.

I was told that it might take a month before the transfer was done because they do 16mm when they have a couple to do because of the set up required.  He also said it might be only a week--it depended on their business.

The most important thing to know before you go is that you have about 4 miles of graded dirt and gravel road from US 95 to the visitor center.  Anything beyond that requires a high clearance vehicle and in some places a four wheel drive vehicle.

The new visitor center opened in February of 2014 and this was my first time at the Range since it opened.  It is open Thursday through Sunday only so if this is your goal make sure you go one of those days.  Even so, there are many new trails that lead from the VC.  Today, we walked the Jackrabbit, Bighorn, and Coyote loops.  There are trail maps and information pamphlets available near the trailheads so you know where you're going.

Our trip today was not the best time to go.  Fall and spring are good times times to visit because your chance of seeing migrating birds is greater.  We saw a few birds today but not many.

I have included a few photos from the area from before the new VC was built.  I like the old pond better but the current trails are better.  There was mud on the old trail around the pond and this new trail system makes it more kid freindly and ADA accessible.

This is the largest Wildlife Range outside of Alaska in our back yards.  Give it a visit.  It's worth the trip.",10,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I like it especially for the variety the trail offers.  You're completely in a desert yet you see water at least most of the.  There are cactus plants everywhere and then you get near the old Wilson Homestead and you view a lovely meadow with grass and pine trees of various kinds. 

On the way into the canyon, you'll come to a junction with Dale's Trail.  Notice the concrete and stone column on your left.  This was the entrance to the Wilson home.  This section of Red Rock Canyon was a Nevada State park but became part of the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area.

After a short time, you'll arrive at the foundation of the homestead.  Mr. Wilson only lived here for about 10 years before leaving and moving to Las Vegas.  The house was burned by arsonists.  When you're at the foundation, look at the beautiful meadow.  In 1968, the movie ""The Stalking Moon"" starring Gregory Peck and Eva Marie Saint was filmed here.  If you watch the movie, you can see Mescalito Peak and other Pine Creek formations on screen.

After the foundation, the trail forks.  Taking either fork is OK.  The hike now loops around the back of the canyon below Mescalito Peak, the tall sandstone peak in front of you.  To the right of Mescalito is Fern Canyon.  To the left is a side canyon that goes to more hiking and rock climbing areas.

While making this loop, you'll come upon shaded areas where you can have a snack, sit and rest for a bit, put your toes in the stream, or just have some conversation.  Notice the tall Ponderosa pines in the creek area.

After completing the loop, follow the trail back to your car.  As you hike, keep your eyes open for animals.  It was in Pine Creek where I saw the first bighorn sheep I saw while hiking.

I got a chicken Caesar salad and a create-your-own salad to go. Both were a very generous portion of salad and toppings. The create-your-own salad allows you to choose your lettuce mix, and up to 5 toppings are included. The toppings included green beans, corn, white beans, artichoke, sun-dried tomatoes, chopped eggs, and meats such as chicken and shrimp (Just to name a few!). The salads and toppings themselves tasted very fresh, even after bringing back my to-go boxes home and putting them in the fridge for a few hours until dinnertime. 

The dressings were full of flavor. I chose the lemon Dijon vinaigrette, which had a nice tangy, creamy consistency and taste. Other dressings that I could remember included 2 types of balsamic vinaigrette (Regular and fat-free), and green goddess.

The total for 2 salads and 1 soda was about $20, which is decent considering the size and quality of ingredients. 

In addition to their salads, they also offer sandwiches, soups, and frozen yogurt. If you do get a salad, it comes with a decently sized roll (Wheat/multi-grain or white).

We've eaten at Posh before but only for their ramen night so we wanted to see what the rest of their menu was like. This is basically American style omakase, where you leave it up to the chef to choose your dishes for you. You main choice will be how many courses you want served to you. Everyone at my table had the 5 course meal. I feel like it was an adequate amount of food. Had I not been a pig and eaten a lot of complimentary bread I would have been pleasantly satiated after dessert instead of slightly overstuffed.

We were hoping to take advantage of the early bird/sunset special which has discounted prices for the prix fixe meals. Unfortunately you have to be seated before 5:30 and by the time we all got seated a few minutes after 5:30 the discount deal was over. We still forged ahead and went with the 5 course meal for $65 ($52 during the discounted times).

The menu has the selections of main ingredients that are offered and you have the option of crossing out any foods you don't like and you can also request foods that you do want to be put in your improvisational meal. 

We started out with an amuse bouche, a delightful Belgian endive with balsamic vinegar and roasted beet. It was light and refreshing and the balsamic had a nice depth of flavor. For the most part we each were served different dishes so that we could have a sample of each other's courses. My favorites of my 5 courses were the sweetbreads and monkfish. It's hard to find either food on a menu so it was a pleasure to try the Posh version of both! For dessert I enjoyed my selection of chocolate cake with chocolate ice cream and we were given an extra dessert after our dessert, a lemon lollipop.

Service was good and our server was great at explaining the menu concept and refilling drinks. 

Overall each dish was interesting to try, something a little out of the ordinary. The individual dishes themselves weren't really anything I'd seek out and crave for next time though. Also, if we were to talk semantics, the use of the term improvisational is a bit misleading for me. When I imagined an improvisational meal I was thinking that each course would be a beautiful and unique snowflake, a specially designed impromptu dish that no one else would have. Looking at the food served at other tables though it looks like they have a set standard of menu options which they rotate out for each diner, not as fun! I do understand the need to have some sort of standardization though if you are serving multiple tables.

While I do reminisce about the old days of yore, Xtreme bean does serve up very good coffee drinks that are smooth yet strong.

I was meeting friends for breakfast this morning but it fell through and I didn't get the memo.  After sending a text and finding out we weren't meeting, I searched the Yelp app for breakfasts restaurants and this was one of them that came up.  Off I was.

I was going south on Decatur and drove right on by when I noticed the blue symbol on my map was going away from Lou's.  I made a u-turn on a side street and started north on Decatur and there it was, tucked in a small strip mall removed some from Decatur and not having much curb notice.

When I went in, the first thing I noticed was the large amount of bric-a-brac in the restaurant most of it related to kitchens both commercial and home.  One thing that caught my eye was a box from my first food processor, a Veg-O-Matic.  It made me smile because I realized how old it was and therefore me.

My server, Patty, was to my table almost before I sat down (the sign says to seat yourself) and she was back quickly with coffee, a glass of ice water, and a menu.  After looking at the menu for awhile and checking the specials board, I ordered their chili and cheese omelette.  I had my choice of a couple of kinds of potatoes but I went with grits.  I also ordered rye toast.

Within a short time, my breakfast was delivered.  Everything was very good.  Patty asked if I wanted any hot sauce other than the Tabasco that was on the table and I asked for Cholula.  There was a nice container of butter with the grits and I let it melt and mixed it around with the grits.

Service was excellent!  Patty was back often to refill my coffee and it was a pleasant breakfast.  Since I was wearing a Syracuse t-shirt so close to the freeway, Patty assumed I was from out of town and she asked where I was from.  When I said Las Vegas, she asked how I found Lou's.  When I said, ""Yelp,"" she asked, ""What's Yelp!""  I explained briefly and shower her the app and she got the idea.  She was interested to know I'd be rating Lou's before the day was done.  

One last thing--there's a cardboard sign hanging on strings that says ""Triple Chocolate Cake"" and it has three arrows pointing to a cake holder on the counter.  I couldn't resist.  I bought a piece to bring home and have for dessert tonight.  I'm sure it will be just as good as breakfast!  This is a good breakfast spot.  The hiking group may rue their snubbing of me!

Addendum:  The chocolate cake was excellent!",6,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The show is just under an hour and I was surprised at how quickly the hour went by.  The lead characters who play the spoof characters of Slick, Lil' Boss, and Chump look like the real life Pawn Stars.  This gives the show a familiar look to those who watch the TV series.

A summary of this show could be that it has a very thin script and is goofy and corny.  There are bits that make you groan and other times laugh.  You know something is not quite right when my biggest laugh was the producer's mention of the ""Real Housewives of Pahrump.""  

The show is stolen by the antics of Enoch Scott.  His main part is to be the voice for the Old Man puppet.  However, his many roles are where the show goes off track, funny and goofy though they be.  Trying to move the story along, Scott plays a number of characters and it stretches the idea of spoof a bit thin.

It's nice that they are open 24 hours, so you can have a burrito, torta, or taco any time you want!

We came in search of a breakfast burrito. They have several options here, all under $4. I chose the potato, egg, and cheese ($3.65). It was a hefty burrito, filled to the brim with breakfast ingredients. The textures in the burrito were all too similar, from the slighty mushy potato, the melted cheese, and the soft scrambled egg, and the taste was a bit one dimensional, which made this burrito subpar compared to the heavenly breakfast burritos at Los Favoritos. I had it with some of their hot sauce too, which they only offer in the red variety (Los Favs offers green and red). It was OK, but not as flavorful as hot sauces at other quickie burrito places I've been to.

While they do have a dedicated parking lot, there are limited spots, especially when it's busy. We had to park around the corner in a residential area and dodge cars coming out of the drive-through lane to get to the entrance.

My server came by the table quickly and asked about coffee and i soon had a hot cup of coffee on that cold morning.  It was refilled several times in the time I was there.

I ordred the fried green tomato Benny--eggs Benedict made a different way.  The base is not an English muffin but two slices of green tomatoes, breaded and fried, topped with lump crab meat, and topped by two poached eggs and a remoulade sauce that had a nice zing.  The Benny was served with a small field green salad.  The breakfast was very good.  I liked having a Benedict done a different way.  

The thing that got me about Stewart + Ogden was the staff.  Everyone worked together.  Although I had a server, not one person went by with a coffee pot that didn't stop to ask me if I needed a refill.  Also, the staff were all very polite and pleasant people who seemed genuinely happy to have you in their restaurant.  It was a very nice feeling.

Stewart + Ogden is a little pricey--it's not your bargain breakfast, but if you're looking for something different and outstanding service, I recommend Stewart + & Ogden highly.

A very flavorful stack of four brioche rounds, wonderfully soft and flavored nicely with almond.  On top of the stack were some banana slices and the plate had some small pieces of chopped kiwi and mango.  The plating was very nicely done.

I had a choice of three syrups and I went with the coconut syrup.  You also have the choice of getting whipped cream which I opted for.  Along the the whipped cream and the syrup comes a small container of almond butter which is very rich and very tasty!

Service was excellent.  Well, you'd expect it to be!  I was the only person in the place who wasn't an employee.

The dining area has both regular human-manned cashier registers and self-service kiosks behind the registers. After browsing through the menu, I ordered the conflicted burger, green style, and shared the cry+fry. You'll get a beeper after ordering, and if you get a soda they do have a Coca Cola Freestyle machine that offers a special lime flavor apparently exclusive to BurgerFi. 

It didn't take too long for our orders to be made. Unlike other burger shops where their lettuce wrapped burgers are placed in a paper pouch to prevent everything from falling out, this burger was placed directly on a paper bowl with several leaves of iceberg lettuce instead of a bun. Initially picking it up was fine, and the crisp lettuce with the two burger patties was an excellent contrast of textures, temperatures and flavors but over time the uneven surface of the lettuce leaves would slide off the burger and the sauce ran all over my hands making for a wet dripping mess. I liked the contrast of the ""conflict"" in the conflicted burger: the veggie patty's slightly nutty, lightly crisp outer texture with soft filling was delicious with the primal taste of the beef patty.

The cry+fry was a very generous portion of onion rings and hand cut fries. The onion rings were gigantic and I liked the crunchy light batter but the onion itself was bland. I liked the fries better, which were lightly crispy.

Overall it was a pretty good experience and it's a good choice if you're looking for a delicious burger and fries.",25,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

(Go figure!)  :)  She arranged with the chef at 28GO to make a Prix Fixe dinner of five courses.  I'll use the chef's descriptions:

Course 1:  This was called Popeye's Revenge and was a spinach roll dressed with spicy garlic sesame and laced with sweet balsamic-soy glaze done to look like cuts of a sushi roll.  Tasty mushrooms in the spinach. good seasoning, and the plating was very well done.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/28go-the-restaurant-las-vegas?select=_sAqDGLULvhcj9kjhfKS8A#pKPj_Y4VjqiYU6s9sDYzGg

Course 2: This was a tofu poke martini which was lightly seared tofu cubes tossed in sesame-soy wasabi oil atop a seaweed salad mix.  It was a martini because the presentation was in a martini glass.  The tofu was excellent--a nice crisp outside and great tasting dressing. 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/28go-the-restaurant-las-vegas?select=_sAqDGLULvhcj9kjhfKS8A#XygDeqRJb33GticwMFhMoA

Course 3: This course was named grilled vegetable Napoleon with a blue agave glazed grilled assorted vegetables with cabernet vinaigrette and tamarind-miso paint.  The vegetables were eggplant, onions, and bell pepper and it was plated beautifully to resemble the layers in a Napoleon.  Again, seasoning was well done.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/28go-the-restaurant-las-vegas?select=_sAqDGLULvhcj9kjhfKS8A#1ttjaX7efdZkIM2ObksT8w

Course 5: White Rabbit is made from imported Thai coconut milk ice cream rolled inside a white mochi quilt.  The ice cream was very flavorful and the quilt was tasty, too!

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/28go-the-restaurant-las-vegas?select=_sAqDGLULvhcj9kjhfKS8A#GYCMqWYG39oSp5RXEo_f6w

In addition, I had for a drink a 28GO coconut cream fizz with tapioca pearls.  This is a non-alcoholic drink that was refreshing and added to the meal.

The food was excellent, the plating was well thought out given the names for the dishes, and service was excellent!  I found the meal filling and I'd really like to go back and try the place again.  I thought the meal was a bit pricey given there was no animal protein and even organic vegetables wouldn't merit the price we paid.

The restaurant is a small place behind the Rebel Book Store across Maryland Parkway from campus.  Monday night was a great evening.  There was no one else there besides the 10 of us for awhile.

Getting there is a breeze from the 60, and the drive from Tempe is a lot nicer than taking the 101 or surface streets to Scottsdale.

The parking lot is a little narrow and it doesn't seem like there are as many spots as the Scottsdale location which is located in a shopping plaza. I didn't have any problems finding a spot though. The dental office is part of a whole conglomeration of various veterinary specialist offices and shares space with veterinary opthalmology and dermatology. 

My appointment was at 8 AM and I got here a little early. Unfortunately none of the front office staff were here yet at 7:45 and quite a few other people and their dogs were waiting awkwardly with their dogs either in their cars or outside. I understand that the office doesn't technically open until 8 but I feel like not being able to enter the office at a reasonably early time and making us wait adds to the potential stress of an appointment. They did finally open 5 minutes before 8.

At the counter there is a front office person for each specialty. The waiting room is fairly spacious with nice seating.

We were taken back shortly and the front desk who doubled as an assistant went over the procedure for the appointment and explained all the paperwork to sign. We also arranged a pick up time.

When my dog's dental cleaning was over I received a phone call from the tech saying he did great and there were no problems. When I arrived to pick my pup up Dr. Balke did an excellent job at explaining how everything went and went over the radiographs and blood work.

The front desk/assistant was so friendly and engaging and I felt like my dog was given the best care and comfort by her and the other techs.

On the way back, it's uphill, but it's an easy grade so there's no huge amount of exertion.

There are two street crossings that you need to do with care--Flamingo and Fort Apache.

The hummus tasted freshly made, and had a bite to it from the addition of garlic.  I was feeling like eating more of a light sandwich so I got the tomato mozzarella.  You have your choice of ciabatta or foccacia bread for your sandwich (When asked, our waiter recommended the ciabatta because of the crispy texture, which is what I chose).  The ciabatta was excellent: light, crispy, and airy.  The tomato mozzarella was fresh, with a sizable amount of greens and some fresh basil.  It also came with a balsamic reduction which had a nice, thick, sweet flavor and texture.  I also had a bite of the Southerner, which had great flavor from the combination of pulled pork, mustard, and slaw.

I wasn't a big fan of the iced tea, although my husband really liked it.  I felt it had a weird aftertaste, but he really liked the taste of the tea.  To each his own I guess!

The only other negative was that the closest parking spots are metered 24 hours, so you will have to shell out a little bit of money ($1.50/hr, credit cards accepted) additional to your sandwich bill here.

While other culinary institutes have larger budgets and subsequently larger tuition price tags, being part of the Community College Program allows a budding chef to get a culinary education at a fraction of the cost. There are full-time student programs as well as evening/Saturday programs for those that work during the week. Along with degree programs they also offer certificates (Your culinary classes without the general education requirements). As you can see there are a good variety of options for those interested in getting a culinary education here.

I took an intro to culinary arts class (CUL 105) which was comprised of people in the industry looking to get the certificate to advance in the field, people looking to break into the industry, and others taking it for fun. In an 8 week intro class you understandably can't cover all that there is to the culinary world, but we did do a ""greatest hits"" version. We learned about mother sauces, making stock, various ways to cook potatoes, the all important vegetable cuts (If you need anything made into a tourne cut I got you covered), making pasta, butchering a chicken, and various methods of cooking proteins.

The nice thing about the intro classes is that the director of the culinary arts program actually teaches them so you get instruction from the head honcho. As someone that built the entire program from ground up, Chef Collins has worked in numerous restaurants and businesses, holding a degree from the prestigious Culinary Institute of America and has a wealth of information about classical French cooking, healthier alternatives, and international cooking.

The evening classes start at 5 and end when everyone finishes and cleans up, usually around 9 or 10 at the latest. 

Tuition for in state students is $84 a credit hour, compared to say, The Art Institute of Phoenix, which charges $481 per credit hour. Since I haven't taken any classes from other (More expensive) culinary schools I can't really say if there is a significant difference in materials, etc. justifying the increase in cost at other schools, but I was happy with the education I received at SCC.",19,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I bought a few items online a few years ago in different sizes because I did not know which size would fit me best. When I tried to return the ill fitting sizes they refused to let me return brand-new, tag-attached items because they said I had reached my limit for returns which is BS because I hadn't bought that many things in the past nor in this current order.

So I'm on my way back to my car at Scottsdale Quarter when I notice the storefront's dress selection of flowy, delicate, pretty designs.

What I did find lacking were boards showing me where I needed to go to get my connecting flight home.

I went to the C gates before I found a set of boards and realized I had to retrace my steps and go back.

As you enter the 33 Hole area, turn left at the first side road and go to that parking area.  There's a bathroom along the way in and a picnic table close to where you park. From the picnic table, take the steep trail down the hill.  Go across the bottom where Lake Mead used to be and cross over a small ridge.  After that ridge, turn left following the trail up the wash into White Owl Canyon.  

From here, you'll go through two sets of drainage pipes under the new and old roads that go along the lake's shoreline.  In between, you'll pass through a meandering slot canyon of layered mud hardened and formed by water over thousands of years.  Always keep your eyes both toward the top of the canyon and along the bottom.  On the top, we often see an owl who'll be watching us as we near a nesting area.  On the bottom of the wash, look for owl pellets--the bones and fur of animals the owls have eaten and then regurgitated.  They cannot eat again until they rid themselves of this waste.  As you look up, you'll also see some areas where the owls have nested over the years.  

I always do this hike as a loop.  After the second tunnel, I climb out of the wash to the old road and walk that north for about a mile before following another wash that leads back through a tunnel and connects with the Lakeshore Trail and then follow that back to the steep hill to the car.

Over the years, I've seen the lake's water level drop and ride--but mostly drop--until now the one area is totally dry.  It's sad to see how the level has dropped and the egrets and heron are no longer near the trail.

CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,1,2011-09-12,1,xXb8RoLBtfzbN-dXtezbfg,5,"Review for Restaurant Week 2011 menu:

Service started with a small bowl of edamame.  Another restaurant that does something than give you a bread basket.  Good idea.

Course 1:  Lobster pot stickers with miso butter sauce.  The pot stickers were grilled perfectly and the plating was nicely done.  I expected a stronger lobster flavor, but it is ground filling so maybe my expectations were too high.  They were very tasty.

Course 2:  Macadamia nut encrusted mahi mahi eith lobster essence.  The mahi mahi was tender and soft as it should be and it was moist and cooked perfectly.  There was a base of a small amount of potato puree that held some red potato slices on which the mahi mahi was placed.  It was crowned by asparagus spears.  A fine main course and just the right amount.

Course 3:  Melting hot chocolate soufflé with raspberry sauce and vanilla bean ice cream.  This isn't a traditional souffle, but it comes close to it.  The melted chocolate inside was very hot and you needed to wait for it to cool before really trying more than the tiniest taste.

Service:  Everyone was great!  When i was seated, I was in the dining room at a table meant for 4 people.  I had noticed the kitchen bar/sushi bar seating when I was going to my table.  I asked the hostess if I could sit there instead and she said, ""You can sit just about anywhere you want.  Come on.""

I like restaurants that have a counter area that overlooks the cooks doing their thing.  I also had a good time talking with a couple of them and they showed me some of the dishes they had made before they were served because they noticed my inquisitive look at what they were doing.  This made the meal all the more enjoyable!

My server was there to ask how each course was after I had chance to try them, and he refilled my iced tea promptly.  Altogether, this was a wonderful dining experience.  I am sure I'll be returning to Roy's.  This RW menu gave me a good taste of their food and the whole experience showed me what they're like.",1,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Two of us ordered a trio of proteins--shrimp, chicken, and beef.  My friend doesn't eat shrimp, so it was put in a bowl on the side with extra sauce and I had double shrimp.  Her husband had beef tacos, and my wife had a chicken dish--the name escapes me.

We all enjoyed our entrees.  Very tasty sauces, good portions without being huge, and just the right amount of seasonings.

For dessert, each couple shared an order of chocolate tacos.  The taco shell was a bit rubbery and was filled with vanilla ice cream.  We made the mistake of not picking it up and eating it like an ice cream sandwich when it was cold and still somewhat frozen.  We were given small spoons when we needed a knife to slice through the bottom of the taco.  Still, it was tasty if a bit challenging to eat.

hHtOsr-NMviBKlMqDBeI9Q,1,2011-05-07,0,7SJAlRkoRa_FxAW1Z2kBQQ,5,"Very cozy little breakfast/brunch/lunch spot in downtown Chandler.  The closest cross streets for Yoli's are S Wall St. and Chicago, and visitors coming here for the first time may have a hard time finding it if they don't routinely shop in the little artisan craft plaza the restaurant is in.  Once you enter, you are greeted warmly by one of the family members.  We had brunch here, and left pleasantly full and satisfied.  

The meals are a very good price for the portions given.  I was especially impressed with the carne asada burrito ($6).  The burrito was gigantic, encompassing the whole plate, with a side of delicious freshly made salsa and some sour cream.  The tortilla was grilled which gave a nice added texture to the meal.  They have a ""choose your own breakfast"" option which I tried ($6.50), which comes with 2 eggs, and then 3 different breakfast selections (such as French toast, pancakes, breakfast meats, different breakfast potatoes).  Everything was prepared fresh, tasted very good, and a nice option I found was that they had sugar-free syrup for those that didn't want regular syrup.  They also have pretty good coffee ($1.75), both hot and iced.  It is smooth and rich, no hint of bitterness.  

If it weren't for yelp I probably would not have even known about Yoli's, but thanks to the wonder that is the internet I now have a good breakfast spot to go to when I want to start my day off right.",4,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

In addition to the standard beers you'll find at any restaurant, they have several locally produced brews so that anyone searching for a beer to fit their taste will most likely find it.  I tried the White Chocolate Ale, which had a nicely toasted nut flavor with a white chocolate background, more of a refreshing light beer.  My friend tried some of it and remarked that if dessert beers ever existed, this would be one of them.  I'm not too much of a beer fan and the closest beer-like beverage I've enjoyed is lambic, but it did taste nice compared to other beers I've had.

We started with the scotch eggs, which were excellent.  The breading was nice and crispy, the pork sausage was flavorful and moist, and the eggs were perfectly cooked with a deep golden color to the yolks.  I had the vegetable panini for lunch, which was decent, albeit greasy.  The coleslaw I ordered with it was creamy but bland.  The menu itself has a weird mix of foods from different regions.

I parked at the Briare Park and then rode my bike north along the Kellogg/Zaher Sports Complex to the terminus of the trail at Durango.  It's a pleasant ride with some elevation gain and as Dan points out, it would be a service road if the Summerlin Parkway had one.

On the way back, I took a slight diversion.  At the Briare Park, I came out to the sidewalk along Tenaya Way and rode it to Westcliff Drive.  Going east on Westcliff, you come to a newer section of the trail that travels underRainbow Boulevard and then continues to Jones.  The one section to Jones was not yet done.  At the entrance to the ramp that goes to the tunnel under Rainbow Boulevard, there's a plaque and Mayor Goodman gets her props on it.  The n the trail goes under Rainbow and past a large drainage catch basin.  It was here that I turned around and rode back.

Eventually, the Bonanza Trail is supposed to connect with the city trail system.  Only parts of it are off road, shared use trail.  One section you can see is the bridge over Decatur near Western High School.

My recommendation in riding this trail is to park at either Bruce Trent Park and ride down to  Durango and get on there or enter at Briare Park and ride from there.  Either way, the views are very good and it's a safe place to cycle because you're off street.",10,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Am I insane in the sushi brain? Maybe. I could eat possibly an ocean's worth of sushi. I certainly feel like I did so after eating here! How could I help myself after finding out that they have an all day happy hour on food and drink on Sunday? 

I shared a ton of food with my friends. Garlic edamame, sashimi, 2 happy hour rolls (Jalapeno crunch and Alaska), caterpillar roll, and ended our meal with a mochi triple threat (Green tea, strawberry, and mango ice cream mochi). 

The garlic edamame was awesome. It had a spicy kick with a pungent sauce that was perfect with the neutral taste of the edamame. Of all the rolls I enjoyed the caterpillar roll the most. It had a good amount of topping and filling, and all the components (Crab mix, avocado, eel with sauce) were well balanced together. The jalapeno crunch roll was a bigger roll, with a generous amount of fresh jalapeno, cream cheese, and crab mix with crispy crumbs along the edges of the roll. I wasn't too impressed with the Alaska roll, as there were pieces that had only the tiniest smear of avocado, and while I appreciate the creativity in adding some small thin sections of fresh lemon on top, I'm not sure I liked it in this particular roll. 

The sashimi was decent. It tasted fresh. Some of the slices were cut thicker than what I've seen at other sushi restaurants. Some of the sashimi had a bit of gristle still on them unfortunately. In general, they weren't as flavorful as other similar sashimi platters I've had in the past. For instance, my favorite sashimi fish, escolar, was in the platter, and it didn't have the rich, buttery taste of others I've had at different restaurants.

The wasabi they use here is odd. It is not spicy at all and is more like a lime green colored paste since it doesn't really have a lot of flavor. I placed a generous amount of it on a sashimi piece and bit into it and even then I didn't detect any kind of spicy kick.

The dessert was good, and each mochi piece was cut in half and drizzled with chocolate sauce. 

Service was superb. Our server was humorous, friendly, and attentive. Major props to him for giving us an entertaining and enjoyable service.

Overall, 3.5/5. Great service, but the sushi and sashimi is just OK.",20,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

With comes your choice of home fries, home fries with onion and pepper, or hash browns.  I chose the home fries with peppers and onion.  You also get choice of toast, biscuit or English muffin.  I went with the rye toast.

The omelette was large and very filling and the home fries were excellent.  I was glad I got the onion and peppers fried with the potatoes.  I chose rye toast.  While waiting for the breakfast to arrive, the owner and barista this morning, brought me a mini carrot cake muffin to start out and he made sure my coffee cup was filled.  

I recommend this place highly.  It deserves all 5 stars.  Service is excellent, and the owner and his wife were very attentive and pleasant.  The horse racing theme is interesting.  On each table, there's a little call box.  On it are buttons for four things--service, drink, bill, or cancel.  If you press one of the buttons, a colored number lights on a board on the wall in the front of the restaurant.  The server can see if you need more drinks or want your bill.  The small box is like a mini KENO board.  There's also a drive through if you want to get a coffee or other drink from espresso bar and pick it up at the window.

I will be back here to try lunch.  The menu has some very interesting things to try!",4,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

On top of that I went to the bank initially, but they only notarize certain documents and they don't allow employees to be witnesses. I also went to the UPS store and another mail service store, who said the same thing. The attorneys who wrote up my documents offered a notary service but it would have to be scheduled at a certain office really far from where we lived during regular business hours, and for us it is very difficult to take any time off from work, especially when a longer commute somewhere is involved.

To save myself the hassle, I finally went with a mobile notary. Seeing the good reviews for Stacey, I sent out a quote request and was answered promptly. Communicating with her was easy and scheduling was no problem. She met us at our home after we were done with work, and had all the paperwork signed and notarized in no time. Her fees were less than what the attorney's office was charging too. I'd definitely use Stacey again in the future if I need anything else notarized.",14,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I was here just before 8 AM and they weren't yet open.  Promptly at 8, the door opened and I was shown in.  I was told to sit anywhere.  The first thing I noticed was what a nicely decorated restaurant it was.  It was a sushi restaurant that closed which explains the large amount of bar seating and the food prep going on behind the counter.

I ordered the special of the day which was a breakfast croissant with 2 eggs cooked the way you want, two sausages or two slices of bacon--your choice--and your choice of cheese.  It also came with breakfast potatoes they called hash browns.  They're really not hash browns but they were very good potatoes.

Everything was very good.  My coffee was refilled quickly.  Angel, the server, was very pleasant!  I asked her about the Date Nights they're having and she explained and gave me a copy of the menu from their first anniversary Date Night dinner.  Normal date night dinners are $16.95 and you can call to get information about the menu and pricing.  

Angel brought a case with pastries--doughnuts, cupcakes, etc--and at first I thought she was offering a complimentary one.  When she told me the price, I then knew they weren't freebies.  It wasn't something I wanted with breakfast and since I was riding my bike, I didn't want to take any along to get damaged as I rode along.

When I looked at the menu the first thing I noticed was how odd the pricing structure was. Instead of rounded numbers or prices that end in .99 or .98 I saw items such as Greek salad for $9.17 or chicken parmesan for $7.91. Perhaps the pricing is based on some percentage increase rather than increments in whole amounts. It wasn't a detrimental thing, but it was interesting to see such unusual looking prices for items.

The menu is quite expansive and includes chicken, seafood, pizza/calzones and pasta. We started with the drunk bread appetizer, I ordered the eggplant Parmesan dinner, and had a bite of some sausage, garlic and olive calzone. 

We were first served some delicious complimentary bread. It had a light texture with a delicate crispiness around the edges. The olive oil/balsamic mixture it was served with was great. The appetizer was equally as good, with prosciutto, cheese, and a heavy dose of butter. It was touted as being doused with white wine which it very well could have been but I tasted more melted butter in the bread than anything (Which isn't a necessarily bad thing). A delicate drizzle of balsamic vinegar on the side completed the dish.

The eggplant was a sizable portion and a ton of food for your money since it also came with a side of salad (Romaine with croutons, olives, and tomatoes) and spaghetti with tomato sauce. I didn't care for the heaviness of the breading on the eggplant but it was crispy and golden. My husband on the other hand enjoyed the heavy taste of my dish a lot so to each their own!

The calzone bite I had was quite tasty. The dough was perfectly cooked with a light outer crispness and well seasoned filling.

Service was good. Our server was elegant, friendly and polite. She refilled drinks as needed and came by to check on us as needed. A manager even stopped by to say hi.

I'm not sure if it's every Friday night but this evening there was a gentleman playing some cover songs on his guitar and keyboard which I enjoyed.

There's something for everyone here.  It's a fairly level hike for a good part of the way so it's fine for dogs and kids.  After crossing the wash from the parking lot, simply follow the trail as it meanders toward the canyon.  After the waterfall, there are several routes you can take.  You can stay in the wash when it's dry and do some rock scrambling and boulder hopping.  This is a slower way but it's a lot more challenging.

If you want to go a little easier on yourself, follow one of the trails out of the wash on the south side of the canyon and hike the use trail until you a forced back into the wash.  If you want, you can keep going and end up in Pahrump if you really want to.

The rock scrambling and boulder hopping are good fun but you should only do this if you're wearing hiking boots so you have the proper traction on what can be slick rocks.  Sneakers just don't do it sometimes.

With a population of just over 15,000, it is the closest town in Southern Nevada that has a main street with businesses and parking that would remind many people of small towns in which they may have grown up.

My enjoyment of Boulder City is with its public art.  Nearly every corner along Nevada Way has some statue, either donated by the artists or for sale, and it makes for a pleasant walk of discovery.  Many of the statues deal with the workers who built Hoover Dam and some are of the children who lived in Boulder City in that era.

Our courses were brought in shopping bags and we provided our own steak knives, paper plates, and napkins.  It was like having an indoor gourmet picnic.  

First course:  Highway 46, Hen Gone Wild, and Coq Au sandwich

Second course:  John S Park, charred cauliflower steak, PB&L, and Cigar City

Course three:  Tri-tip, Bucky Duck, baby steak fries, and Lamb for Logan

Dessert course:  Whiskey bread pudding

There was a lot of good things here coming out of the small Goodwich TBD incubator along Las Vegas Boulevard.  Highway 46, avocado toast with pea tendrils was quite good as was the salad with fried chicken.  The Cuban sandwich in course two and the charred cauliflower were my favorites.  In course three, I liked the steak fries and the duck.  Ending the meal, the whiskey bread pudding was very enjoyable.

Sitting in Dino's was an interesting place to eat.  I do like eating outside but when you're sitting on the sidewalk with assorted characters walking by, it's not my favorite outdoor dining.  Dino's makes it interesting with its loud music--none of it from my generation--and interesting patrons.

The lounge is a perfect, small venue for this kind of entertainment.  There were probably a hundred people there.

It's an intimate room.  I do have to agree with other comments about how close the seating is.  The cocktail waitress, a very slim, pretty thing, had a hard time navigating through the chair and table maze.  Faugno at one time, when he came into the audience, got himself blocked from returning to the stage until he figured an alternate route out of the maze.

The lighting and sound were done very well and enhanced the performance.

I have one major complaint--the price of drinks.  I realize where I live and I know the Palms is a ""hot spot"" for the young things, but $4 for a bottle of water!  I should have gotten a free water from a waitress in the casino and given her a good tip.  It would have been 1/2+ less than what I paid in the showroom.  That's almost nightclub kind of pricing.

For me, as a note on the dish as a whole everywhere, I prefer a little more acid to balance out the sweetness, but that's just me.

The bbq plates we've had have been tender, with a lot of savory and slightly sweet flavor. The bulgolgi and spicy pork were excellent. I also tried some udon which had a more delicate, seafood flavor with a heaping amount of veggies, some fishcake, and noodles.

I had a reservation for 6:15 and I was greeted on arrival by two very pleasant ladies.  One of them showed me to my table and it was the first encounter with the friendly and attentive staff that work here.

I studied the menu online before I went and I had narrowed my decision to two choices, the Japanese Kobe wagyu A-5 filet or the wild game tasting of three game foods.  The waiter went through some special items that weren't on the menu and he threw a curve ball at me by telling me they had a bison tasting menu with 3 preparations of bison.  I knew they were having bison during July, and this sounded really good.  After some discussion with the server, I opted to order the Kobe filet as I have not tried real Japanese waygu before. 

For starters, I ordered the soup tasting trio and got the lobster bisque, the heirloom tomato, and wild mushroom flavors.  The soup comes in a container with three small wells for the soups.  It gives you a chance to taste three of their four soups.  The lobster bisque was good and even this small portion had some lobster pieces in it.  The tomato was absolutely the best.  Very flavorful.  The weakest of the three was the wild mushroom soup.  I thought it was a bit thin and didn't have a strong mushroom flavor.  The runner ground some fresh pepper into each.  One small nit here was the soups sit on another flat plate.  Since the fit is not quite exact, the soup moved around some and on delivery, some of the tomato had mixed into the other too.  Points off for this on Chopped, I'm sure.

Then came the filet.  With it were 4 pearl onions.  I ordered a side of fries to accompany the steak.  They bring you a small dish with house made ketchup and mustard.  A note on the fries.  Some of the Yelp reviews state they're not crisp fries and they're correct.  The fries have a less than crispy texture and they are oily and pre-salted, just exactly what I like.  I didn't mind the lack of crispness nor the oil.  It's just the way they prepare them so if you don't like fries cooked that way, don't order them.  I very, very rarely use ketchup yet I was drawn to try the mustard and ketchup.  The mustard was OK, but the ketchup was actually better than I expected.  It was sweet, from some small raisins in the mixture.  I didn't dip many fries in it--just enough to try it out a few times--but I was intrigued by how they changed the flavor from the standard bottled kind.

The filet was very tasty and tender.  I had asked for it extra rare, and when my server suggested ""blue"" I responded affirmatively.  It was done a bit more than I like but it was OK.  The only thing here was that on one side of the filet, there was a section that was very sinewy and I was unable to cut it with my knife.  I tore it with the knife and fork into a couple of shreds.  I thought it odd that a cut of Kobe would not have had this trimmed or would even be like this.  Since I expected the steak to be above and beyond anything I'd ever tasted, I began to wonder if in fact I had been served A-5 wagyu but being a neophyte, there was no way I could accurately tell.  Suffice it to say that when I finished the steak, even thought it was very good, I was thinking I should have ordered the bison.  

For dessert, I got the bananas Foster bread pudding.  Very tasty and very filling. It was a good ending to the meal.

Service was excellent.  I had Team 1.  I believe one was Raul but I cannot remember the other's name.  My iced tea was refilled regularly, one of the two checked on me throughout the meal, and two other people from the restaurant stopped by to see how everything was.  It was top notch service.

We called Baseline Mechanical- they were extremely sympathetic, and rushed over to help us fix our problem.  Jason came over to look at our compressor, and we can't thank him enough for getting up on our roof in the sweltering heat to fix our A/C.

GMGQmFE2DFK1lwaHQkJLaA,3,2012-04-03,1,IMw2P6lNmih8mwgCozFiqg,3,"The show is still in previews and this was only the third performance for the show that opened Saturday, March 31st.  I'm taking that into account with my review.

There is some excellent talent with the show.  Generally the singing is very well done.   Standouts were Sheriff Dodd, Miss Mona, and Jewel.  The singing and dancing by the ensemble is also good.  A standout in the dancing was that done by the Aggies when they pay their annual visit to the Chicken Ranch.

There are some problems with the show: 

The showroom's stage was not designed for a Broadway musical and the scenery is very sparse--a staircase to the girls' rooms, here merely a landing--a chair, and a love seat.  At one point, there's a desk but that's the only major change in scenery during the entire show.  It would be difficult to do more than this.

Given the limitation imposed by the stage, when the crusading journalist first broadcasts, it's in front of the gold stage curtain.  Since he's supposed to be at the state capitol building, couldn't a generic capitol building been projected onto the curtain to at least make an effort at reality?

The sound was an issue tonight.  At one point, many of the wireless mics failed.  It was especially important because the governor was making his appearance and his mic didn't work.  When he launched into his song, one of the cast members gave him a hand mic which didn't work at first either.  Another issue with the  mics was that some of the cast, when they punctuated their words, there was a sound from the mics that detracted from what they said.  This is an issue which the previews should solve as the cast and crew iron out the problems.  I had some quibbles with the lighting but it was generally OK.

Finally, why did the woman who works with the photo concession have to go down the steps to the front tables three or four times during the show?  Apparently she was delivering photos, but it was distracting, unnecessary, and rude to the artists on stage who are working to provide a good show for the audience.  The photos can wait until after the show.

I will come back and see this show in a few weeks and I hope I'll be able to raise the rating.  I have seen some of the cast in other shows in Las Vegas and they need to have microphones that work, consistent lighting, and respect from the other workers at the showroom, i.e., photo person!",5,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I went to Mastros tonight for the first time and I convinced my wife to try Restaurant Week, too!  We were very pleased with the meal.

We got a nice bread basket with several types of bread.  I really liked the pretzel rolls with salt.  There were five choices in the basket.

Course 1:  We each got a salad--my wife's was a Caesar and mine was their spicy mambo salad.  They were both the same greens but my dressing was made with some wasabi, hence the spicy.  Both salads had a good amount of freshly grated cheese on them and they were very tasty.

Course 2:  I ordered the Scottish salmon and Andrea got the 8 ounce filet cooked medium.  I had several preparations from which to choose for the salmon and I chose the blackened option.  The salmon was delicious.  The filet was very good, too.  

With their Restaurant Week menu, diners can choose two sides.  We each ordered garlic mashed potatoes.  My wife ordered the creamed spinach and I got the creamed corn.  The sides were huge.  Since we each ordered the mashed potatoes, we got a regular portion which is their standard size for sides.  The corn and spinach were smaller versions.  All three were very good.  I needed salt, but then anything needs salt.  Samantha started us out by giving each of us some of the sides so we each could try everything.

Course 3:  For dessert, Andrea got the chocolate layer cake and I got the Key lime pie.  ALong with the desserts, we were brought a large bowl of freshly made whopped cream--lightly sweetened.  The chocolate cake was huge.  My Key lime pie was more a normal size.  Both were outstanding!!

We ate in the Tree House overlooking the shops at Crystals.  Service was superb!  Our server, Samantha, was excellent.  The staff cleared tables promptly, cleaned the table cloth between (not that I'm a slob or anything), our iced teas were refilled often, and the pace of the meal was perfect!  

I am so glad Mastros participated in Restaurant Week.  It gave me a chance to try it and I will be back.  What a fantastic start to RW Fall 2012.",6,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I saw the District One sign and made my decision then.  The restaurant had a fair number of people so I sat at the bar.  For one person, that often is a good option.  I looked over the menu for some time and opted to eat healthier than normal.  I ordered the Shaken beef salad with house dressing.  It was a nicelyu done mix of greens with tender, warm beef slices, and topped with the house dressing,  The flavor was a little spicy which was good.

After finishing my salad, one of the servers asked me about dessert.  He named two things and when he said coconut, he had me.  I got the coconut ice cream which is a half fresh coconut with ice cream inside and nuts on top.  As you eat the ice cream, you scoop out the coconut meat and it's a very good combination to get ice cream, fresh coconut, and nuts in one scoop.

Service was very good.  My iced tea was refilled a couple of times and I didn't need to ask.  A very pleasant stop!",17,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Since I always sit in the front row when it's general admission, it's bad form to start snoring right in front of the actors.

This Starbucks in Albertsons was relatively handy to another stop I had to make.  A person was leaving with their coffee as I approached the register and the barista waited on me quickly.

I was soon on my way with an iced quad espresso--what I would call alertness insurance!  The coffee was very good, just what I expect from Starbuck's espresso.

We actually were hoping to go to another breakfast spot (Sweet Tomatoes) only to find out that they don't serve breakfast anymore, so we headed to U.S. Egg, which was crazy packed so it would take forever for us to get seated, and to get food.  So, Coco's was our little Bronze medal as our 3rd choice to get breakfast.  There was no wait to get seated, food was decent, freshly made, and although it saddens me to see the enormous amount of calories I will be consuming since they list all your meal calories on the menu, it is very helpful for those that are trying to eat healthier.  I also like that they offer organic fair trade coffee ($2.49), in addition to your standard brew ($1.99).  They also offer a nicely tart iced peach green tea, which is very refreshing.  

I had the peach French toast, which came with your choice of egg and meat.  The french toast was a sizeable portion, with freshly cut peaches in a nice glaze that wasn't too sweet.  The French toast itself was decent, not too spectacular, but the turkey sausage I ordered with it was nice and flavorful.

I was seated promptly and was brought iced tea by a server.  Then I was left to peruse the menu.  Another server came along and asked if my order had been taken and when I said it hadn't, that server took the order.  It was short--a cup of gumbo for an appetizer and the crawfish étouffée.

Then there was a wait for the soup to be brought which was delivered by the original server.  I had not half finished the soup when the same server brought my main course--one of the things I find most disconcerting about restaurants.  The server said something along the lines about being sorry this came out so fast.  Is that OK?  No it's not, but I took the dish.  There was one other table occupied in the dining room and you can't get the courses evened out?

The soup and the étouffée were very good.  There was some Louisiana brand hot sauce on the table that said, ""One drop does it.""  No it doesn't.  I shook several good squirts and it still wasn't spicy hot but was better.  That has nothing to do with Lola's but Louisiana brand hot sauce would be my last choice in the future.

The étouffée was made with a rich brown roux and had some kick to it, enough that I didn't bother to ask for a different hot sauce.  I enjoyed it the way it was.  There was a good amount of crawfish.  Server 1 also brought me some more bread, thin slices, grilled a brief bit and nicely crisp.

For dessert, I ordered the sweet potato pecan pie with a dip of butter pecan ice cream.  The pie was very good.  It had a very soft texture from the potato and was not a custard-like pie as a pumpkin pie would be.  Very different and very good.

I enjoyed my dinner but I deducted a star for the timing of the service.  That simply should not happen especially in an almost empty place!",18,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I was aware of Chef Carlos when he was at the other place a few blocks away but never went there.  After being reminded of him by Susie H.'s recent review, this was on my to try list ASAP.

We arrived early last night (Sunday) after the Ribbon of Life show at the Smith Center.  We were the only ones in the place.  The server told us to sit anywhere we liked and she handed us the menus after we were seated.  Before leaving, she read the specials of the day.  There were two dinners, a wrap, and I believe a salad special.  She had me hooked with the first thing she read--bleu cheese pasta with steak!  I ordered that and my wife ordered Chicken Angelina.

The bleu cheese pasta was made with penne rigate and the steak was grilled, sliced, and placed in strips on top of the pasta.  The bleu cheese sauce was exceptional.  A great bleu cheese bite with every taste and there was extra bleu cheese crumbles spread on the pasta.  My wife chicken Angelina was a seared chicken breast served on top of garlic spinach and mashed potatoes with large pieces of mushroom.  It was topped with artichoke and there was a dijon cream sauce.  She enjoyed it a lot!

Although we were both full, we had our minds set on having dessert we had looked at online earlier in the day.  She got a chocolate molten lava cake and I got the chef's indulgence.  Both were outstanding!!!  The menu describes the indulgence this way:  A Cheesecake Spring Roll, Crunchy Bites of Brownie and Mini Banana's Foster Cheesecakes, served with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Fresh Strawberries and House Made Berry, Caramel & Fudge Sauces.  For the single version there's one brownie bite and one mini bananas Foster, but that's more than enough.  There are sweetened tortilla strips on the bottom of the plate.  This is one of the most creative desserts I've seen.  

Chef Carlos came to the table twice to check on us and we chatted about the food and what he'd done since he moved to this newer spot.  The restaurant is almost completely closed from the VP bar so there's almost no smoke smell from the bar coming into the restaurant.  I can really see this place coming onto our rotation list of places to go again and again.  I'll call and ask the specials before I go.  What a wonderful gem hidden away in this video poker bar!

While I am not knowledgeable about Irish pubs, McMullan's earns all 5 stars--it was as good as it gets!

I asked our server, Jessica, if we could sit out of the bar area in the small room that is to the right after you enter.  Once our eyes adjusted to the dim lighting, it turned out to be the right choice.  It's a delightful room and just a bit away from the music and the talking in the bar area.

I had studied the menu online before we went, and I knew what I was getting, the Irish chicken curry pie.  Andrea surprised me by wanting the steak and mushroom pie so it was Irish pies for both of us.  We knew in advance that it would be at least a 25 minute wait and we just chatted and I took some photos and explained what was behind the door to the Shenanigans room.

Our pies were brought to us and they were delicious.  I loved the curry taste of my chicken and there was some zing to the curry.  It was much different than the flavors of Indian or Thai curry.  The pastry was very flaky and stayed that way all the time I was eating.  Andrea enjoyed her pie, too.  With both dinners came a large amount of mashed potatoes and a good serving of peas.  All the time, our iced teas were refilled and Jessica checked back often to see how we were doing. 

Of course, a dinner out is not complete without the sweet so we ordered sticky toffee pudding for dessert and shared it.  We got it with vanilla ice cream which was put in a separate glass goblet so the heated pudding didn't melt the ice cream.  A winning dish!

During our time here, Mr. McMullan came to the table twice.  He remembered me from the shows I was there to see and he wanted to say hello.  Later he checked to make sure everything was OK with our dinner.

The personal touch of Mr. McMullan, the delightfully friendly server Jessica, and the outstanding food all made the evening a 5 star experience.

A plus for Cafe ZuZu is if you check in on Yelp, you get a free glass of wine (Choice of 3 or 4 wines, listed on the check-in screen).  While the entree was delicious, the appetizer was a different matter.  We shared the ahi tuna sliders ($10), and I was surprised to see that there was no slider aspect of this appetizer, just slices of tuna with veggies.  The tuna itself was seared on the outside, but seared for too long so that the tuna was mostly cooked.  It had a light breading on the outside, but that couldn't save it from the lack of flavor.  The marinated vegetables that came as a side were more flavorful than the tuna itself!

Our waitress was lethargic with taking orders, getting our orders, serving us, and getting our bill.  Also, she didn't tell us any of the specials of the day, I had to specifically ask what they were.

I had a reservation for 5 PM and was seated immediately after they opened.  My server, Mark, was excellent and his assistant, Max, was good, too!

I had studied the menu online and I ended with the following order--wild mushroom soup for a starter, the 10 ounce Manhattan sirloin (asked for it done blue), and for a side I got the lobster risotto.

Shortly after getting my iced tea, I was brought a Gruyere cheese popover in lieu of bread and a cup of soft butter.  The popover was excellent.  (Eat the popover while it's hot--it loses the popover fluffiness if you let it cool).

The mushroom soup was good although it wasn't the most appealing looking dish there could be.  When it was time for the main course, I heard a runner behind me ask ""black and blue"" and I knew he was delivering my steak.  The problem here is I didn't order it black and blue--just blue.  The char was good but to get it the steak was overcooked.  If I want it black and blue that's the way I'll order it.  The lobster risotto was OK.  There were some nice pieces of lobster but I'd recommend a different side.  I regretted not getting the truffle fries.

For dessert, I got the quad small cups of the following--S'mores Edge, red velvet cake, key lime pie, and cheesecake coulis.  The key lime was excellent and the s'mores was good.  The other two were just OK.  They almost looked like the servings that buffets are doing now.

Service was excellent as I stated.  Iced tea was refilled without needing to ask and Mark checked on my progress regularly.

The prices are high and are in line with some of the better steakhouses on the Strip which doesn't make sense.  They're Las Vegas Hilton prices in a Westgate world.

1d6c6Q2j2jwVzBfX_dLHlg,1,2011-05-17,0,j9usVQAWnzvHQQo7Hcij0Q,5,"Tried the Restaurant Week special, and chose the Stetson chopped salad, mixed mushrooms with polenta, and bread pudding.  The Stetson chopped was amazing.  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out, and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet, savory, crunchy, soft once the salad is mixed up.  I tried some of the testosterone salad, which was decent, and filled with a lot of well prepared beef, but it didn't quite compare to the chopped salad.  

Just as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish, but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later, the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.  

The bread pudding was amazing.  Perfectly moist, with lots of flavor, and not too sweet.  

Service was excellent (Thanks Owen!), and along with the extensive selection of wines, they also have some more unique beers such as lambic, as well as a nice selection of non alcoholic sodas (The cream soda is locally made and very tasty!)",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I started off with some complimentary miso and a small bowl of edamame.  Good start on both counts.   For my dinner, I got an order of Uni Nigiri and their Tokyo Special Roll (Inside the roll were tuna, kampyo, and crab.  Outside the roll were 6 pieces of fish (tuna, salmon, and white fish) with a spicy garlic sauce.

During dinner, two complimentary dishes were made for me.  One was a sizzling skillet of King Oyster mushrooms and one oyster shooter with hot sauce.  Finally, I had ginger ice cream for dessert at no extra cost.

The sushi chefs were really good and very pleasant guys.  The two kinds of sushi I ordered were prepared very well, and the complimentary food was delicious.  I don't think I've had such tasty mushrooms slices.

The selection here is pretty unique, with their signature creme brulee donut being one of their most popular items. The shop is in an older strip mall a few doors down from House of Rice and has limited hours (They usually close at 2). 

I ended up with a creme brulee, cherry pie, and plain cake donut. The creme brulee indeed had a bit of ""brulee"" burnt sugar as a topping, with frosted sugary glaze, custard in the center hole with a raspberry on top. I enjoyed the caramelized part of the glaze as well as the custard and berry, but thought the glaze itself ended up being too sweet for my tastes the more I bit into it. The donut dough was soft and fresh.

I also had an iced coffee with almond milk. It was decent, just your average tasting coffee.

Service was very friendly from Vincent our Local Donut Guide.

I've had the Cuban and the Reuben. One of the times I ate here I was hoping to get the paprikash (I haven't had this dish in years!) but sadly, they were out of it that day. The Cuban was the better of the two, with tender pork, ham, pickles, and mustard. While it would have been nice to have a pressed, crisp sandwich bread, the buttered roll it was on was good. The Reuben was OK, but a little greasy. The prices for both were $8.50, and included a small side (Potato salad or coleslaw). 

Fountain drinks were $1.75 and are Coke-based.

Service was friendly, and the sandwiches were made quickly.

It wasn't too busy when we were here for lunch, so it's a good place for you to sit and chat without getting overwhelmed by tons of people. As for pricing, knocking the prices down a dollar or two would give me more incentive to eat here.",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

To be fair though, you get a lot for your money, and I was definitely stuffed after sharing a chicken and sea bass teppanyaki combo ($42) with my husband. Also, I'm sure some of that price is reflected in the entertainment the chef provides for you while cooking your food. We decided to get the additional split charge items for $10, which includes a second appetizer, salad, rice, soup, vegetables, and dessert for the second person sharing the entree. 

Our chef at the table was pretty entertaining, and he had a few fancy tricks up his sleeve, setting things aflame and showing off his knife skills. Our grilled food was cooked excellently, from the slightly smokey flavor of the fried rice, to the tender, juicy chicken and perfectly cooked sea bass.

We also tried the signature Sapporo roll. It was a fairly large roll, with fresh yellowtail, salmon, crab mix, asparagus, tobiko, wrapped with soy nori. 

Our total with 2 sodas, sharing the combo, and the roll ended up about $80. Although the food was good, and there was a lot of it, that was quite a pricey meal for sharing 1 roll and 1 teppanyaki plate with no alcohol!

P.S. If you get the teppanyaki wagyu Australian beef, it's pretty freakin' amazing, but be aware that the market price will be around $60 for this melt in your mouth, marbled, grilled beefy wonderland!",4,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

They were lightly crisp, perfectly tender on the inside and the ranch ""dust"" gave the potatoes a whole new dimension of flavor. I also had some of the hummus nachos which had smooth creamy hummus with crisp, slightly chewy pita triangles. The balsamic vinegar drizzle on top was a great touch.

The layout is chic and uncluttered, with various tables, a cold fridge section, numerous varieties of wine for purchase, a dessert case, and a cheese case. 

The food came out in a short time and smelled heavenly. The croque madame was perfectly crisp, with a lovely mix of flavors from the ham and cheese. The runny egg on top was perfect. It was so filling I could only finish half of a sandwich. The roast beef in the sandwich was tender and flavorful. The pomme frites were more thinly cut, but had an airy crispness and were perfectly seasoned. The cafe au lait was smooth and I loved the hint of chicory in the coffee. This version tasted a little lighter than others I've had though. 

At this time the menu seems more skewed towards traditional French dishes than Louisiana style cuisine. For instance, the dinner special for today was a rabbit cassoulet, and the only Louisiana type foods I could see for today (for lunch) were the beignets and chicory coffee.

At the condiment and utensil counter there is honey, agave nectar, and sweeteners at the table include sugar in the raw and stevia.

If I didn't already have enough desserts at home for a small army, I would have taken home some of the goodies in the dessert case. There were various flavors of macaron, stout gingerbread, fruit tart, and eggnog cheesecake when I browsed.

What I like about the Paris show is the production.  There are several high definition screens that display works of art, pictures of New York City, and some psychedelic-like art at the end of the show.  The panels add a beauty and class to the show that raises it above what it was at the Hilton.

I liked the wide selection of different spring rolls, and decided on the soft shell crab spring roll ($6) since I love soft shell crab.  The roll tasted decent, but nothing spectacular.  The same could be said for the salted fish and shrimp fried rice I had as an entree ($9.50).  It was a basic fried rice.  I was surprised to see that the ""salted fish"" was actually finely meshed bits of fish integrated within the rice as if it were a seasoning for the rice.  Although it just tasted OK, the portions of rice and shrimp were sizeable. My friend had the #2 pho bowl, which was a very large portion, but for her it wasn't too remarkable.

The atmosphere here is kind of dark and uninviting.  It seems like there are some renovations that need to be done too, since there was a big leak dripping down the ceiling onto the booth right behind us.  

Service was mixed.  Our main server, while friendly, was very awkward and wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu.  We weren't served any plates to go with our spring roll appetizers, and I had to specifically ask for napkins since there weren't any at the table or any given to us.  The server that refilled our waters and sodas was very nice and promptly gave us refills as needed though.  The soda I had, a diet cola (Not sure if it was Coke or Pepsi, $1.75) tasted very watered down, with not enough carbonation or syrup.  

There was only one real dessert item on the menu, a Vietnamese style flan ($2.50), which was decent.  It had a nice creamy texture, surrounded by coffee flavored syrup and had ice cubes on top of it.

The choices today were avgolemono or lentil soup, and Greek or Caesar salad. I went with the avgolemono (chicken lemon) soup and the Greek salad. The soup was very thick and hearty, with a strong lemon flavor, packed with rice. I could taste small bits of chicken in the soup, but after a while, I got tired of the strong lemon taste.

Several minutes went by and a woman appeared from a door which turned out to be the kitchen.  She then seated me.  Little thing #1.

I had a Groupon and she asked to see it.  When I loaded it on my iPhone she stated she wasn't sure they were doing it that way.  They wanted a paper printout.

Now for the meal--it was superb!  I got the 8 ounce filet which was on a bed of garlic-onion mashed potatoes (the menu says puree, but it isn't).  There were 5 stalks of grilled asparagus for the seasonal vegetable (they were perfect!), and the drizzled Port syrup was very tasty.  The crispy tater strings were forgotten or maybe they hadn't been delivered yet, either.

For dessert, I had the Gossip Sundae--green tea ice cream on powdered crispy wontons with butter rum caramel sauce, caramelized bananas, and walnuts.  Of course, the bananas were missing.

The 51s have never been strong contenders for league winners.  They have been affiliated with the Dodgers, the Blue Jays, and now the Mets.

There have been some rumors that the 51s will be re-branding and using a different name and a new theme.  The team has been sold and the new owners want to build a new stadium a block from where I live.  Gone may be the Area 51 reference in their name and the mascot, Cosmo.  Speaking of Cosmo, anyone who has to prance around in an outfit like that when the summer temperatures are in the 100s deserves to be paid well!

It's fun to go to a 51s game and I'll be back sooner than the years I've let go by without returning to Cashman Field for a game.",1,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
cbbidA4huw2XQQWlmbUQgw,0,2012-04-28,0,8KZwsXShUlLWzc9-K_NK8g,3,"Decent choice for Mexican staples such as burritos, chimichangas, and enchiladas.  Service is fast, friendly, and attentive.  The salsa that came with the chips came in two varieties: mild and hot.  The mild wasn't chopped well enough, and there were whole stewed tomatoes in it, but it tasted OK.  I think the chef mistakenly thought that you had to add black pepper instead of whatever type of pepper they would normally use for the hot salsa, because it was littered with thick black bits of pepper, so much that when you smelled it, all you could smell was black pepper.  

The food came out in very fast time.  I had the shrimp enchiladas, which were OK.  They weren't the best enchiladas I've had, but not the worst.  One shrimp still had some shell on it, and the shrimp itself was a little tough.  The green sauce was nice though, and it came with some big chunks of nice green chile.  The rice and beans that came with it were pretty good, very flavorful.  I tried some chicken chimichanga, which was a pretty big size.  The chicken was tender, and the tortilla it was wrapped in was nicely deep fried and came with a good amount of guacamole and sour cream.

We came here around 7 on a Friday night, and it wasn't busy at all.  They do have a mariachi band that comes in around 7:30-8 P.M. to perform, so there might have been more people coming in later!",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

There was a very wide selection of food stands, including some more exotic cuisines from Guam, and even a delectable food stand that just sold malasadas (Hawaiian doughnuts). There were also a lot of vendors selling wares from jewelry, to clothes, and even the Hawaiian Experience Spa was here selling gift certificates for lomi-lomi massages. There were also a lot of informational booths with lots of activities for kids to do, and various entertainment on the stage (Mainly a lot of various types of dance). Unlike other festivals, where you can feel a bit suffocated by the lack of space as you walk around if there are a lot of people around, Tempe Beach Park is spacious enough (And the set up of the festival is spaced out enough) that you can walk freely without feeling confined.

It was a cloudy, dreary, slightly rainy day, but that didn't deter us from having a good time! Since it was so rainy the day before, it did make the ground very muddy and wet in certain areas, so those that are coming to the festival this year should be prepared and wear shoes they don't mind getting mud on!

I tried a lot of different foods, such as loco moco from Island Loco (Normally a food truck), a plate of food from the Guam stand, and some Japanese takoyaki from Toh Zan. In total we spent a little over 20 dollars on food and beverage, and left with satisfied stomachs.

If you are driving here, a handy little tip- park across from Tempe City Hall in the garage for free parking! It's a short walk to the festival through scenic downtown Tempe. Otherwise, event parking is in various uncovered lots and is $10.",8,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The show is OK.  I really enjoyed the band before Caliendo was introduced.  They played a Beatles, a KISS, a Neil Diamond, and Jesse's girl and it was quite a lot of fun especially watching and listening to different audience members and how they reacted to the songs.

Caliendo came out and started with his impressions.  He certainly does Bush and Clinton well, but he has yet to do Obama well.  I think he drives his impression of Charles Barkley into the ground by overdoing it.  It's just trbl, trbl, trbl!

The most enjoyable part of the show for me is his bit lying on the floor.  His hand gestures are funny, and this was the best part for me!

I got a short stack of the Rocky Road pancakes.  The menu describes it this way:  ""Almonds and marshmallow in chocolate batter, topped with fresh whipped cream, more almonds and marshmallows.  Lightly drizzled with chocolate syrup and cocoa powder.""

How's that for having dessert for breakfast?  The cakes were excellent!  Very flavorful with lots of good chocolate flavor and the sliced almonds added some nice texture.  Our coffee was refilled quickly.

We were promptly served chips and our waitress took our drink order quickly once we were seated. The chips were a huge portion and size, served with salsa and refried beans. The red chile was made with large chunks of beef. Although I appreciated that they used whole chunks, they were bordering on the side of being too large to eat with one bite.

I met a good friend from Toronto and he chose this place because the buffet to which we had planned to go at the Fremont was closed for renovation.

They still have a $9.99 prime rib special and that's what we both ordered.  It comes with soup or salad bar, baked, mashed, fries or other options for starch, and cherries jubilee for dessert.  I asked for the rarest piece of prime rib they had and I was off to the salad bar.  My friend got the soup of the day, a corn chowder.

The meals came quickly and my prime rib was a nice reddish pink color.  We both ordered baked potatoes and Sandra--our very 'Aloha' server--brought small containers of butter, sour cream, and horseradish before the dinners were ready.

This is not prime rib from some fancy, high priced restaurant.  It's a basic slice of prime rib, thin, but it had good flavor and it's quite a bargain for what you get.  The baked potato could have used a bit more cooking but it was otherwise OK.

The dessert, cherries jubilee, is simply a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of some cherries in a sweet sauce.  While not the real thing, it was an enjoyable ending to the meal.  Since my friend uses insulin and can't have the ice cream, I fell on my sword and had both.

With Boyd owning this casino and picking up other properties around the valley, I'll go farther afield with my dining offers than just the Suncoast.  I enjoyed my dinner here.

The show is a very pleasant tribute to Frank Sinatra.  The cast--roughly resembling members of the Rat Pack--sing some of the songs Sinatra made famous and they ask the audience to join in if they remember the songs.  We all do remember, but few people joined in.  Why ruin such good singing coming from the stage?

The show has been moved from the Wolf Theatre in the Clarion Hotel to the main showroom.  The production has lost some of its intimacy and the small audience last night seemed lost in the large main theatre compared to the intimate setting of the Wolf which was once Debbie Reynolds' screening room when she owned the hotel.

The four singers of ""Shades"" are Ryan Baker, Lisa Smith, Carmine Mandia, and Larry Liso.  They all give strong performances doing the Sinatra songs.  They also say from the get go that they are not impersonators.  Rather they are tribute artists singing Sinatra's songs.

After doing the Goldilocks test of sitting on various styles of furniture, we liked the cushioning of their custom sofas. There are many options you have to choose from if you go custom, from the cushioning (standard, firm, spring, or down-wrapped), size (Small, medium, large, and extra large), type of arm (English, sock, track, pleated), type of base, type of back cushion, sofa fabric and pillow fabric. The possibilities are endless! The only thing that you don't really have control over is the actual height of the back (Has a higher back, which was something I was specifically looking for), not as deep of a cushion (Something my husband was specifically looking for), and the size/height of the base ""feet"".

We worked with both Nic and David. David was very helpful in explaining all the features of the sofas, the benefits to Bassett construction, and all the different options for fabrics, etc. I appreciated that they will let you check out fabric so you can see if it will match the room you are going to place it in. Nic was great in helping pick out fabric for our pillows (You get 1 for each piece of the sectional you are ordering). They were having a 30% off custom furniture sale, which helped bring the price down to something a little more reasonable. The price ended up being on par with something comparable at Thomasville, La-Z-Boy, or another similar store that offers more customizable furniture.

A very big plus for me was that the custom furniture is made in the U.S., and it will generally only take them 30 days to make it for you, as opposed to other companies which will take anywhere from 8 to 12 weeks. Their database is also very helpful because they can show you how much fabric is currently in stock, which will let you know if it will take longer because they are waiting for more to come in.

The burger was a heavenly concoction of juicy, well seasoned beef, crisp lettuce, sliced tomato, red onion, with flavorful sauteed mushrooms. The sesame bun it was on was lightly toasted and provided some nice texture balance with the sesame seeds, slight crispness around the bun's edges, and the soft bun itself.

I bought three bars--Elviiiis, Park Ranger, and Sin City.  Not being able to wait, I opened the Elviiiis last night and had a few squares.  The Elviiiis is a combination of San Francisco milk chocolate, peanut butter mousse, and banana chips.  If it weren't so rich, I would have eaten more.  The high quality ingredients and the flavor make you want to savor your chocolates and not just eat it all.  The banana chip pieces in the bar were excellent texture and tasting!

I am looking forward to trying the other two bars, but I'm going to behave and dole out small quantities.

I had the chance to meet the owner, Jin, as she is a delight.  Nelson Q. explains that Jin is Korean for pearl.  She certainly is!  She has a radiant smile and a knowledge of chocolate that is amazing.  Her desire to make the very best chocolate treats comes through in everything she does.

The service was very good.  In about 5 minutes, I had my plate of pan fried noodles made with vegetables and chicken.  Their 6 is more equivalent to 8 at other places so I chose wisely.  My server brought me the 4 jars common to Thai places in case in needed to spice it up a bit.

Dk3H2CPh_yb6CaN11XEFMA,15,2016-05-21,11,-6D6LRyWCU_r1MxDGu0iGQ,3,"Empanadas, bubble tea, and desserts? Wow what a combo! I love the idea but unfortunately the execution leaves much to be desired. I think they might be trying to accomplish too many things and as a result while they have a lot of variety they don't succeed in focusing on creating an ideal product. 

I came here for lunch and decided on the #1 combination ($6.75) which comes with 1 empanada of your choice, a side, and a drink. Note that the fountain drinks are either iced tea (Black or raspberry today), or lemonade. Sodas are by the can. The empanada case had a variety of flavors such as gaucho beef, chorizo, and samosa (Which isn't really a flavor per se and I get what they are trying to convey, but it's kind of like saying your flavor is ""wonton"" or ""eggroll""). I went for the paella chicken empanada, enticed by the description of savory chicken, red bell peppers, and saffron infused flavors. Your sides are tortilla chips, kettle chips, or coleslaw. I went for the coleslaw.

Since the empanadas were already made, it took no time to heat it up and get my side plated. Seating is nice and comfortable with chairs and padded (Leather? Leather-like?) booths. 

The empanada dough is not as flaky as Republica Empanada's, and the filling was overly salty for me. There weren't enough textures to add variety to the filling either and I could only discern the stringy chicken texture and the mushy background texture. In terms of flavor, I could definitely taste the saffron, but the salt tended to overpower any other flavors the paella might have had. In addition, I got a small piece of chicken bone in my empanada- not good eats!

The coleslaw, on the other hand, looked beautiful with a sprinkling of black sesame seeds to contrast with the dressed lettuce, but tasted bland to me. I could only taste a very faint flavor of sweetness and vinegar. 

I wolfed down my combination meal but was still hungry. If you are going for a full meal I would go for the larger combination #2 which includes 2 empanadas, drink, and side for a little less than $10.

If I'm in the area I might stop by again to try a bubble tea but overall I wasn't overly impressed with the empanadas or coleslaw.",15,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I would have given it four stars, but the prices are too high for the food you get.  These are strip prices, not some off-Strip mall prices.

I had the southern Indian style diced lamb.  The seasoning was wonderful.  My friends had 1) the Origin India Kebab platter and 2) the lamb shank.  We also had one order of regular and one of garlic naan.  We also ordered fried papardam.  They were out of the fried so we got baked instead.  It was only 4:45 in the afternoon.  

For the three of us, the bill was just over $100.  We had cokes and an iced tea, no alcoholic drinks.  Since we had a Restaurant.com certificate, they added 20% service charge to the bill before the discount.  That's just too much for three people for what we got.

After browsing through the plethora of options I decided on a protein bowl and an iced tea. The protein bowl has various meaty options was well as tofu, with your choice of grain (quinoa or brown rice) and sauce. I chose the quinoa and tumeric tahini sauce. It was fairly busy around lunchtime so it took some time to get my bowl made. When it did arrive it was a beautiful mix of colors and quite a large portion of food. It included roasted beets, fried tofu, red bell pepper, carrot, cabbage, and roasted sweet potato. Quite a lot of veggies for your bowl! A perfect mound of microgreens was placed on top. All the components meshed together well taste wise and I enjoyed the tahini sauce which was a good consistency to go with the bowl. They did sneak a piece of chicken into my vegetarian bowl though. Good thing I'm not totally vegetarian!

There is a counter off to the side that offers the various iced teas. I had the Kaleidoscope blend which was light, refreshing and delicious. The cup they gave me was huge too!

If you can't finish your meal they do have a self serve station with various to go boxes.

UL3n_yKPA93XlnUgB_YqgQ,0,2014-01-05,1,od7i79MYpvStbIJ6ESGcpQ,2,"So... when your establishment says they will be open at 8:30, and you arrive after 8:45, you'd think they would have food ready. Not the case. An unenthusiastic, stony-faced employee told us that they weren't ready to serve anything yet. We asked if we could take a look at the menu in the meantime, and the employee told us to look at their website. Um... what restaurant doesn't at least have a list of their items available for people to look through at their physical location (Or maybe he just didn't want us in the restaurant even though they are supposed to be open)? Disappointed, we left and ended up just making breakfast at home.

Despite getting the cold shoulder in the morning, fate brought us to this area again in the evening. After an outing with the pups at the dog park, Jeepney was within such close proximity that we decided to try some items to go. I entered and while the unenthusiastic employee glanced briefly at me, no ""Hi"" or ""Welcome"" was to come my way. I had to go around the counter and wait for a few minutes until he decided to ask me what I wanted to order. 

There were maybe 10-12 items sitting in bins available, ready to serve up. I didn't see any heat lamps though, so I'm not sure how they kept the food hot? Some of the items, like the pancit, looked really dried out on the surface as if they had been sitting out for a very long time (Maybe since they started to make the food in the morning?). We ended up ordering 4 items with rice. They were as follows:

Chicken adobo- good taste, with bone-in dark meat chicken. The sauce had a deep tasting soy-sauce flavored base, and reminded me of chicken my mom used to make when I was growing up.

Mechado- This was a hearty beef stew. Another flavorful entree, with tender chunks of beef, and a thick tomato based sauce.

Opo squash- Sliced squash marinated in a vinegar based sauce. The delicate, slightly sweet flavor of the squash contrasted with the sourness of the vinegar well. It was decent, but not a favorite dish out of the 4.

Bopis- Another person at the counter said that the meat in this dish was pork liver. Taking it home, trying it, and then looking at the menu online, this dish is actually made with pork heart, which has a distinctly different texture and taste. There were some chewy white bits, which turned out to be pork snout. While the meat itself tasted alright, the sauce was too murky tasting and indistinct for me to actually like it.

I had actually requested a few other dishes, since I had browsed through the online menu before entering, but the employee said they were out of them (Lechon Kawali, Dinuguan). 

The price was very inexpensive for the amount of food we got ($6.45 per 2 item combo). However, since some of the items weren't really that great tasting, and others looked very old, I'm not sure I'd order from the ready-made trays again. I've heard their family meal ""Boodle Fight"" is great, so maybe one of these days we will try Jeepney again in hopes of a better meal.",4,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I ate mostly vegetarian dishes because they were so good and they came first on the buffet.  There wasn't much room for anything else.  Well yes there was, but the vegetarian selections were excellent!

For plate one, I had some Saag Paneer, Dal Maknni, Butter chicken and another chicken whose name I can't remember. (Note to self - bring a notepad).  The spiciness of the first two dishes--the vegetarian ones--was simply superb!  The spices were not overpowering but were just right.  There was also a little bite which is always welcome.

For plate two, I had some Aloo Korma, Fried cabbage, Eggplant Bartha, and some more Dal Maknni.  Again, the flavors were outstanding.

Plate three - I tried three of their chutneys - tamarind, coconut, and mint.  They were all good, but the tamarind was my favorite.  I used them as a condiment on my naan.  While it was not needed--the naan was excellent--I did want to try the chutneys alone and this was the bets option for me.

My last dish was a small bowl of mango custard that was a perfect ending to the meal.  

Service was right on.  Dishes were removed, iced tea refilled, and the waiter checked on me often to see if there was anything I needed. The hostess was a simply lovely woman who was very friendly.  She had to leave while I was eating to run an errand, and she came over and thanked me for coming by and asked me to return. Top notch customer interaction!

The store is very nice.  Everything was very clean.  It looks like they took over the furniture from the previous shop as they are the same and the layout is the same.

There are 6 banks of machines with 2 flavors in each and the chance to do a twist flavor at each of the 6 machines.  The price is $.55 an ounce which puts it on the higher side of the frozen yogurt scale in the area.

I tried a swirled flavor today.  My go to flavors when I'm trying a new place is Cake Batter and Red Velvet.  I swirled them an put some plain coconut and a few pieces of mochi.  The yogurt was very good.  Before I can give the place a higher rating, I need to go back and try the pistachio they have.  I can't say I've seen that flavor at other yogurt places.

The shop sells coffee and they also make waffles and you can get a warm waffle and put frozen yogurt on top.  Sounds intriguing.  On a 100+ degree day in Las Vegas, this little stop was a nice respite from throwing 240 pounds of softener salt into the car.

Whenever I'm in this shopping plaza there always seems to be a line for the drive through so I figured this place must be doing something right to have that much business! We decided to eat in for our first visit and entered to smell the appetizing scent of fried chicken. The menu is very basic and consists of primarily individual combo meals or large party packs. While this does cut down on ordering time I would like a more convenient option for a chicken only package that doesn't feed an army since it seems you can only order by the piece if you want just chicken with no drink or sides.

I went with the 6 piece combo. The sides are already determined for you and are Texas toast, coleslaw and fries. It was ready only a few short minutes after we got our drinks and sat down and were piping hot. The chicken was a large portion, tender, juicy, with a crunchy crispy breading. The breading itself was well executed but a bit plain as I needed the special sauce on the chicken finger to add more flavor dimension to my meal. The sauce itself was pretty tangy/vinegary but had a creamy component to it as well. It was alright but after a while it was too one dimensional of a flavor for me. 

Unless I missed it on the menu I didn't see any other sauces available other than the ketchup at the counter for the fries. I really would have liked some hot sauce to go with the chicken fingers instead of the creamy vinegar tasting sauce. 

The fries were crinkle cut and plentiful. The coleslaw was cool and refreshing but a bit bland tasting to me. The Texas toast had a salty buttery outer layer and was pillowy soft on the inside. 

Drinks are self serve and the options are sweet tea, unsweetened tea, and Coke products.

Service was fast and friendly. 

For what it is, a fast food chicken finger place, this restaurant delivers just as it advertises. While I do prefer other fried chicken places better, you can't deny the quickness and efficiency of Raising Cane's!

I got the prix fixe menu.  You automatically get egg drop soup but then you have choices.  For my appetizer, I ordered pot stickers, my main course selection was Kung Pao chicken, for rice I got the vegetable fried rice, and for dessert I got the mango pudding.

The egg drop soup was good but it needed some salt--at least for me.  There are no salt or pepper shakers on the table and I was OK eating it as it was.  It was a good soup with some small pieces of small broccoli florets.  That was great for texture.  The pot stickers were very good and the sauce served with them was a winner.  The Kung Pao chicken was good.  A good amount of chicken, quite a few peanuts, and a few red peppers but not enough to give the dish much zing.  It's not supposed to have zing so it was made properly.  Portion size was good but not I need a take out box size.  The fried rice was a whole bowl of individual grains of rice, fluffy and tasty.  Finally, the mango pudding for dessert was great!  It stole the show.  The pudding had fresh chunks of mango on it.  What a good way to end the meal.

Service was very good throughout the evening.  I never had less than a half glass of iced tea when a server was there to refill it.  The pace of the meal was good.

After ordering, while the restaurant was still quiet, my waiter escorted me to the glass windows that separate the kitchen from the dining room and explained the four cooking areas and the kinds of cooking sone in each--sea salt baked, open grill, pan searing, and sous-vide.  He also explained their use of apricot would for fuel and taste addition to the food.  Score many more points here.  I must mention what fun I had watching the chefs work behind the glass.  It was quite a show.  I also have a long explanation as to why they use apricot wood.

I started with Michael Mina's signature first course of Tuna Tartare on a small bed of arugula with pine nuts and a quail egg.  It was excellent.  The bread had been brought out by now, and I had two pieces of grill toasted ciabatta and one corn muffin.  Along with the bread was a small plate with butter and a container of garlic and rosemary flavored olive oil.  Wow, was everything good!

The main course was sea salt-baked Branzino with a few green beans, crispy fried polenta, some minted peas, and some pearl onions.  The fish and the accompaniments continued the winning streak of the meal.  Everything was superb!

The dessert course was Valrhona chocolate custard with red velvet cake, sweetened pecans, and some cocoa nib ice cream.  The custard was so smooth and delightful.  It was heavenly!

Everything about tonight's meal was excellent - the service, the food, and the room.  I really enjoyed this experience so very much.  I will be coming back.  And, I had lots of time to get to the art gallery near the Mandarin Oriental and to Las Vegas Little Theatre for the play.  A super night!",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The breakfast was a huge portion that I could only finish half of.

When making my reservation, I never thought of the date being Easter Monday after spring break and when people might not be going out because of the vacation period and the Easter eating.

Nevertheless, Chef Eric gave me a wonderful lesson in making sushi, where the different parts of the meal were sourced, and proceeded to put on a great show with the artistry he used in creating the different sashimi, nigiri sushi items, and some other dishes.

Chef Eric first made some wasabi and then showed me the two different soy sauces that were served.  The Japanese soy was so much better.  Then a series of pieces of sashimi were prepared.  The bluefin tuna from Spain was almost like eating a piece of steak.  Excellent!

In between, he made some sea bream sashimi.  After I was finished with the sashimi, he had the fish taken to the kitchen for deep frying and then brought back to eat the tail and bones up to the head.  It was very good and the soy based sauce served with it was tasty for dipping the pieces as I broke them off.  The same thing would happen later when I had some needle fish sashimi and the bones were again deep fried.  being a smaller fish, the fried bones were more tender.

After this, there was a series of pieces of nigiri sushi put on my wooden plate.  He put a small piece of wasabi under the fish and brushed soy on the sushi.  I can't remember all the things but they just kept coming.

Because I was there by myself, I didn't get the live lobster.  That's a dish meant for two or more people and would be too much with everything else I ate.

Two and a half hours later, I had learned a lot about sushi and I had enjoyed the finest sushi I've ever eaten.  Service was exemplary.  My iced tea was always refilled before it got to just under half full.  

I think some of the micro flowers and greens aren't necessary but they are important to Chef Eric as he is very much an artist with his food and the enjoyment of the food comes from its appearance as well as the taste.

I need to go back with some friends so I can share and try more things.  This is a great experience!!!",27,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I went in to indulge in one of their lunch specials, a panang curry with seafood ($10.95). It didn't take too long for them to make my meal and I was in and out in no time.

The curry came with a small spring roll, a nice little appetizer, with good crunch, filled with veggies. The curry was a sizable portion, filled with fresh veggies, lime leaf, bamboo shoots, and a generous amount of seafood. The seafood itself was tender and perfectly cooked. I asked for it Thai hot and it was the right amount of spiciness for me! It definitely packed a punch. It might not be good for a lunch if you have to work right afterwards though, since your nose might be running a bit from the spiciness.

Service was good and there are frequent regulars that come by for lunch. They were greeted warmly. I was thanked after I received my to-go meal and the cashier said she hoped I enjoyed the meal.

I don't run, but I walk the 5K.  I always have my beard with me so that's never a problem.  I also park in the north lot and make a quick exit on Sunset.

I really dislike the growth in the numbers of dogs that are here every year.  At least they had the good sense to crap at home before they came here, because I saw no doggy do anywhere.

It's fun doing the walk because the entertainment beforehand--Jabbawockeez from the Monte Carlo, some dancers from the topless show Fantasy at the Luxor, and five flying Santas that parachuted to the parking lot from a helicopter high above the boulevard, and others--make this a fun event. Also, the chance to walk over the freeway on Sunset, something you don't do everyday is worth the walking.

fRRQKs10X2JU7pmlWJhKzw,5,2014-07-08,5,aR6CUtnY5By_vlFXQu-Z3g,3,"This review is for their first preview performance.  I am taking into account this was the first show before an audience.  That being said, what i saw last night was an OK show with some promise.  It's in the PH Showroom on the second floor of Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino.

The show begins with good use of the large LED screen installed for Peepshow years ago.  There's a black and white video of Sydney, Australia with views of the Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House along with some skyline shots.  The video continues until the day turns to night and the lights of the city are on.  That's the beginning of Sydney After Dark.  It's a nice video to introduce the ladies from Australia.

The show starts with lead vocalist and MC, Natalie Conway, singing an opening number and the nine girls coming out from archways on the stage that have hanging crystal lines.  

From there, the show continues though a number of traditional topless show scenes.  While not named, I have my descriptors for them--the naughty school girls, the cowgirls with whips, the nurses with the male patient (audience member), a classic showgirl kind of act, and some others.  In between, there are two aerial acts, a woman performing with some silks and another act with a woman doing tease like moves riding in a hoop above the end of the runway center stage.  The women are not topless all the time which is fine.   Except for most of the singing, the music is recorded.

One of the things that needs looking after is transitioning scenes.  The three school girls were almost in their seats when the spots were turned on and two stagehands with their headsets were still on stage from moving the desks into place.  They hurried off the stage.  The transitions need to be done in the dark like all theatre so the lights come up on the women, not stagehands.  This same error happened a second time near the end of the show.

As for transitions, there were times that the people sitting around me and I were not sure an act had ended.  When the dancer(s) started walking upstage and the lights dimmed, we then knew that this section was over but there were times when I wanted to say, ""Huh?""  One section that did nothing for me was the sole ballet dancer.  It's not needed and It didn't add any tease or seductiveness to the show.

There was also a number where three ladies dance one behind the other to Indian sounding music and move their arms and legs like Hindu gods are depicted.  My suggestion would be to move the ladies closer to each other to add to the idea of one being having multiple arms and legs.

TIP:  Do NOT buy the most expensive seats in the floor section near the stage.  When the theatre was redone to accommodate Peepshow, three walkways were built out from the main stage and many times the action is taking place behind the person sitting up close.  There were some unaware that there was a woman in a hoop above and behind them until the lights got their attention.  And there are times when those same people turned around to see not topless women but the rears of the topless women.  Be aware of that when you buy.

There are a number of deals available for discount tickets--a Groupon and a code on the Sydney After Dark Facebook page.  The show is OK.  It can be better and it needs to get better if it's going to succeed.  This theatre has chewed up and spit out a number of shows.  This could be just one more.",14,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
7wHLFohwCw8l6WS-feLjeg,18,2015-04-25,12,VZKpvF1K9m6ILZmuh2JiRQ,5,"I would normally rate Other Mama four stars but eating, unexpectedly, with freinds from Yelp, and the service and good fun we had with the bartender, this is a five star review.

I was just sitting at the last chair on the right side of the bar area when I saw Philip T and his wife.  I moved one seat and set next to the corner by them and that was the start of a fun dinner with good food and good conversation.

I ordered a half dozen oysters, two Fanny Bay, two Duck Island and two Beau Soleil. The two sauces I ordered were the wasabi cocktail and ponzu salsa.  Being from NY where we generally had the choice of Bluepoint or Bluepoint, it certainly is nice to have a selection to order from.  For the next course, I got the octopus carpaccio.  Then I got the pork belly kim chi fried rice.  For dessert, I opted for the Japanese cheesecake.

The oysters were wonderful.  While the sauces were both good, I think I enjoy my oysters au naturel without any sauce for the most oyster flavor.  The octopus carpaccio was a thing of beauty and very tasty.  The sauce in which the tender slices of octopus were resting was absolutely one of the tastiest I've had.  

Next, the pork belly kim chi fried rice was excellent!  It was served blisteringly hot and I recently learned my lesson about carefully moving hot, cast iron serving dishes.  I also learned how to correctly eat this dish.  Remove the pork belly, break the egg on top of the rice, and use the ladle to mix the egg into the rice and then push the rice against the sides of the bowl to get some of the rice to be crispy fried rice.  I learned this by watching Philip's wife who was a master at the technique!  Thanks!  The kim chi is homemade.  It could stand to be spicier for my taste but it was very good.  I finished the meal with Japanese cheesecake at the suggestion of my server, Grazzy!  A good ending to a very good meal.

Not only was the food good, but the service was good also and we had a show by sitting at the bar.  It was interesting to watch the bartender making some exotic drinks including one he made up on the spot.  If you read the drink section of their menu, you read some of the exotic ingredients in their cocktails.  The top shelf of one cabinet behind the bar held a number of jars with his concoctions (I say that in a nice manner) that are used to make different drinks.  He also gave Philip and me a piece of watermelon rind so we could taste what was in the drink of Philip's wife.  The rind had been softening in a blend of his that contained one habanero pepper.  That one pepper was enough to give the rind a spicy afterburner taste, not enough to bother you, but enough to let you know it was there.  Watching him do his thing and chatting with him truly was a show of his craft at cocktail mixing.

In about two hours, I left knowing I'd be back.  The oysters are so good and are priced very reasonably.  There are other menu items I have to try.  Some many choices, so few days in a week!

One final word.  The music was outstanding.  It was as if they had hired me to put their music track together.  Sorry millennials, it's my kind of music!  :)",17,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

During our last visit, I had the mean green burger with sweet potato tots. The burger was a hearty patty, cooked to order (Medium rare for me), loaded with green chiles, jalapenos, and guacamole. The burger bun was lightly toasted with a light buttery taste. The sweet potato tots, while small, were nicely cooked, and the cinnamon-marshmallow sauce that went with it was amazing!

While it took a few minutes for a waitress to realize we were seated and come over, service after that was good. Drinks were refilled as needed and she checked up on us regularly.

LrxDRg8SQdgHMoz3TSAYFg,9,2015-03-02,4,lKLUnrh2XBJojJZgaw1iaA,3,"I was in the area for a play and decided to try something completely different.  After searching Yelp and in spite of the less than outstanding rating, I decided to give DT's Filipino a try.

I looked at the menu for awhile and from the reviews and photos, I had two dishes in mind.  In the end, I ordered pork sisig.  My server seemed a bit surprised and asked if I really wanted the one with the liver.  My answer was yes.  Since it was a cold, rainy day, I ordered Asian coffee instead of an iced drink.  The coffee is merely powdered coffee reconstituted and sweetened to a small degree.

I was brought a plate with a large mound of white rice and then the server brought a plate and the sizzling platter with the sisig inside the covered metal pan.  The pan had the requisite raw egg which i broke and spread among some of the sisig.  There wasn't much sizzle left by the time she got to my table but everything was hot.  The menu descries this sisig as ""grilled pork parts and chicken livers sautéed with onions, sweet peppers and jalapeño served on a sizzling plate.""

The dish wasn't sizzling as I mentioned and I didn't see many onions or peppers or jalapeños.  The jalapeños I had were some fresh sliced pieces on the top of the sisg.  The dish was missing something so I put fish sauce on and this gave the whole dish a good taste.  Since this was my first sisig, I don't know how authentic it was nor do I have any other place's dish to which I could make a comparison.

After finishing the dish (be prepared to take some home--there is a lot), I couldn't ;eave without trying a Filipino dessert.  I was torn between the halo halo and toron.  While the server thought it was too cold for the halo halo, that's what I went with anyway.  It was quite good and had a good amount of fruit and three pieces of flan.  I was surprised that I was charged an extra $.50 for the flan.  One would think it came with the dessert.  The halo halo was a huge wad of ice in the center with the sweetened condensed milk having been poured over it and there was a good amount of white and mung beans and some other fruit that I can't identify.

Service was quite good.  Charina was very pleasant and she helped this newbie order and looked out for me.  This experience has piqued my interest and now I'll have to try some other Filipino dishes at some other places around town.  I may be going back here on a Thursday night if I can round up some friends for their Thursday kamayan night.",11,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

There is an area off to the side for rides and carnival games if you bring your kids with you.

Goods for sale were varied. They were mostly cheap knick-knack type items, clothing, or accessories. They did have some more unusual items for sale at the swap meet, such as a dubious looking stand selling cages overcrowded with budgies, lovebirds and canaries, and a booth selling fancy looking furniture. Off on the far side of the lot they had a lot of produce for sale, including an intriguing spiky-haired avocado looking fruit that I had never seen before.

Food options are basically fast food and Mexican, offering burgers, churros, raspados, elote, hot dogs, burritos and tacos. I was starving and paid $3 for a generously sized churro heavily laced with sugar. Although served hot it was slightly stale, and it tasted like it was fried in really spent, old oil as well.

Service was prompt, and my server was a delightful woman who was very proud of Mix's Yelp certificate.  I decided not to eat all the curry but to take some home for lunch.  She packed the in a small container and also put a container of rice so I had some rice for my leftovers.  Then she stapled the bag shut so it was easy to carry.

Our main courses were quite nice.  They looked like small servings but that was deceiving.  The plates were quite large and somewhat deep so there appeared to be less food than there really was.  My Jakarta chicken was excellent.  Chicken with seasonal vegetables in a Thai peanut sauce with a nice tangy spiciness.  Perfect!  My wife enjoyed her vegetable pasta.  Mushrooms and yellow and green sautéed squash in a sun dried tomato-white wine sauce.  She didn't finish all her pasta so there was room for dessert.

They offer both private and community acupuncture sessions at reasonable rates, and I also appreciated that the bios of each acupuncurist were online. 

My first session was with Kathleen who was very detailed and thorough. She has a kind, peaceful sensibility about her and is a wealth of knowledge on natural medicine. She recommended some things I could do outside of the acupuncture clinic which would be easy to implement. 

I've seen every acupuncturist on staff since and I've been happy with each of them, whether it's Danielle's friendly demeanor and clinical thoroughness or Nicole's cheerful, bright personality and gentle touch.

I also like how the community acupuncture prices are on a sliding scale with a minimum of $25, on a pay as you are able to basis. There are also package discounts of 3 sessions for $70 and also packages of 5 or 10 sessions for a greater discount.

I called up, and the receptionist said to just bring my dog in and the vet would look at him. Once we arrived, we were escorted immediately to one of the rooms and filled out some forms.

The center itself looks very nice, with a contemporary, relaxing atmosphere. There was a TV facing the waiting area playing an old version of The Nutcracker.

Our tech was very friendly and took down all the standard questions. After some waiting, our vet came in. Dr. Dickson was detailed, thorough, and had a great ""patient-side"" manner. He prescribed a radiograph (Chest x-ray) to make sure that my dog hadn't ingested anything that would cause him to vomit, and went through the findings with us on the x-ray light-screen.

I had the Duck Confit Caesar salad for an appetizer, Filet Mignon and Crab Gratin for the main course, and Buttermilk Spice Cake for dessert.

The ambience of Kokomo's is very nice.  If you're familiar with the Mirage, it's a part of the area under the dome - the atrium  with live palm trees, blooming orchids, and tourists in the distance walking through the atrium.

A friend suggested this was a good place to go after dark when the room is darker with soft lighting.  I can understand that now, and I plan to return for a dinner when it's dark out.

I was so pleased with the dinner and the staff that I know I will be returning!",0,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I'm not really totally against them per se but I certainly don't love the food enough that getting a $100 card to them will elicit cries of happiness when I could be eating somewhere else. This is especially true if you received this card around the same time Chipotle had their e.coli issues. But anyways, I've had everything on their menu as a result so I know how everything should typically taste like.

The wrapped burritos at this location are fine, they are the same size and the same amount of fillings and taste as other locations. However, the burrito bowl was very stingy on the rice portion. Out of all the ingredients to skimp on, you skimp on one of the cheapest elements? Odd. I could hardly taste it in my bowl.

I was thinking of getting French onion soup but I noticed that steaks come with house salad and baked or mashed potatoes.  Asking my server about the size of the salad, he assured me it was large.  I opted to forego an appetizer and go instead with the 10 ounce filet, house salad with blue cheese dressing, and baked potato with butter, sour cream, and chives.  For dessert, I ordered carrot cake.

The salad was indeed very large with iceberg and romaine lettuce along with cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and some other items.  The blue cheese dressing was very good and the server ground fresh pepper to taste.

The steak was a little too done for my order of blue.  It was more on the rare side than being less done than that.  I think too many chefs want to make sure they have a char look that they overcook when ordering blue.  The steak was very tasty and quite tender.  The vermouth mushroom butter ($2 charge) made no difference in taste.  The mushroom flavor nor vermouth were there.  I'd get the steak naked another time.  The baked potato was stuffed with the things mentioned above and was good.

For dessert, I ordered the carrot cake.  It was a large slice of classic cake.  It was a bit dry, however, as if it had been the exposed end from the day before.  It was more plain carrot cake without a lot of spice as some bakers do and except for the dryness, it was quite good.

Service was excellent.  

I am of two opinions about bundling the salad and potato as part of the cost of the steak.  On the one hand, I like the fact that you're not being charged a lot for separate items in your meal.  On the other hand, it would be nice to have soup instead of a salad and I'd order French fries any day of the week before I'd get a baked potato.  

I was made aware by my server that the sides were all very large so I stayed with just the potato that came with the meal and that was more than enough.  This is an OK place to have dinner.",10,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

YRyYbOSwvHkZsZOLv98oQg,1,2012-09-03,0,PPYqgbplhWEuCZocQfh73Q,4,"Review is for Restaurant Week Fall 2012 menu:

This was a four course meal with no choice for each of the courses.   

Course 1:  Carpaccio Of Mediterranean Caught Fish With Fresh Herbs, Citrus, Afrala Sea Salt And Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The fish was so delicate and so tasty.  The olive oil and the salt made the dish.  It was very good.

Course 2:  Grilled octopus with roasted peppers and assorted grilled mushrooms.  Another winner of a dish.  The octopus was so tasty and the mushrooms were very good. 

Course 3:  Grilled Mediterranean sea bass.  It was the whole fish with the head cut off and placed to the left of the opened fish.  The server cautioned me about avoiding the collar bones which were attached to the meat.  A very tasty fish, perfectly cooked to preserve its moistness.

Course 4:  Greek walnut cake with Kaimaki ice cream.  Very tasty cake and flavorful ice cream.  

The meal came with a basked of bread--2 slices in my case--I was dining alone.  There was a small dish into which the server poured olive oil for dipping the bread.

I really like the room.  The decor is very nice that I'd like to call modern rustic.  The lights have small filaments in a twist formation that give off a pleasant glow.  The furniture is modern.

Service was quite good given that there was a party of about 20 people that came about 10 minutes after me and they took a lot of time.

A few things keep this from getting 5 stars.  Between the second and third course, the waiter removed my bread and olive oil.  As he was doing it he said, ""You're done with the bread, right?""  I was so surprised by his question and his taking that I just shook my head in agreement.  Maybe he thought I had eaten the main course and would soon have dessert.  Maybe I should have jammed a fork into his hand if I had one.  He'd already taken that.  

There were several small bones in the main part of the fish.  I could just imagine being a judge on Chopped and having my say about that.  Very surprising.

Last, I wish they'd shut the door to the outside.  It was Saturday night and not too far from the entrance are some table games at the Cosmopolitan.  There's also a lot of foot traffic out there of 20 somethings who'd spent part of the day at the pool--not just swimming and ogling the ladies--but also indulging in the spirits of their choice.  They were loud and it carried into the restaurant.  Close the door.

I am a fan of Milos.  I will return, and I think I'll do so for their lunch special.   it should be quieter, too!",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We were immediately greeted and seated.  Our two iced teas were brought in alrge Mason jars and we began to talk about hikes and bike rides and dawdled with the menu.  Our server came back for the order and we were at all ready.  Time to get on task.  When she came back the second time, we were ready to order.

I went with the California sandwich which the menu describes as fresh turkey, bacon, tomatoes and cheddar cheese on grilled sourdough.  It comes with a choice of sides and I stayed with the traditional French fries that I normally get.

We didn't wait very long when she came back with our sandwiches.  I liked that the sandwich was made with pulled apart turkey rather than being made with some lunch meat turkey.  These were serious pieces of cooked turkey.  The sandwich was good.

I was pleased that we had chosen somewhere different because I've been at another BC restaurant a whole lot of times and it was good to have something different to choose from.  I like the bric à brac that decorate the walls to give it an old time look.",13,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The menu offers some unique combinations of food and beautifully presented dishes. We ate here for lunch and had the grilled trout rillettes. They were served on a wooden board with a lovely selection of grilled ciabatta(?) bread, regular and sweet potato chips, arugula, fresh tarragon, pickled egg, pickled beets and a creamy horseradish sauce. The rillettes were well sealed by the layer of (duck?) fat on top of the small glass jar and a treasure trove of trout with cream and herbs lay underneath. The taste was delicate and spread very nicely on the bread. While I loved the horseradish sauce it overpowered the mild taste of the rillette so I had to put the barest amount of it on the bread. As for the other elements on the wooden board, I enjoyed the peppery arugula, fresh aromatic tarragon and vinegary sweet pickled beets. The pickled egg was a beautiful cheery magenta red color. I couldn't taste a lot of pickled flavor in it though and the egg had a slight greyish tinge around the yolk. Unfortunately some of the potato chips were stale and chewy while others were light and crisp. After running out of grilled bread I actually spread the rest of the rillettes on a potato chip to discover I preferred this combination over the bread due to the contrast of crispiness and light saltiness with the creamy rillette.

Service was on point. Drinks were refilled as needed and everyone here was very friendly.

I'll definitely come back again for more one-of-a-kind selections from FnB!",26,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

There are various household items such as nice silk floral arrangements and foliage, cooking supplies, espresso machines, and automatic pet feeders. As for fashion items, when I went they had Gucci glasses cases, Coach and Dooney and Burke handbags, Jimmy Choo handbags, and a large selection of women's, men's, and children's clothes and shoes. Clothing and shoe designers included J.Crew, Banana Republic, and Coach.

Prices are equal to or cheaper than prices at Goodwill. I found some very nice, high thread count pillowcases for $.99 each. The high-end designer wares and electronics (Such as cameras, and a Sony E-Reader when I looked) will be in a glass case. 

Check out was easy, and I like their summer punch card/stamp system (You get a stamp for every $5 you spend, and once you fill the card you get 30% off your next purchase).

The combination is a huge portion of food, whether you choose any 2 of salad, soup, or sandwich, so come with an empty stomach!

I've had their soups and sandwiches, and while the sandwiches are decent, I think the soups are the better of the two. I've had the lobster/red pepper, and tomato basil, and both have had a lot of flavor, with a good consistency. Each soup comes with a chunk of French bread to dip it in.

The sandwiches I had were OK, but nothing special. The grilled cheese was, a grilled cheese. I did like the addition of pesto to the sandwich though. The turkey/artichoke/spinach was the better of the two, with a nice play of textures and flavors on a grilled panini bread.

Service is the counter is fairly speedy, and they will let you sample soups before you try them out.

The drink counter is unique in that they offer different syrups, with an occasional sugar free syrup, to add to whatever soda or tea you want.

7tcfLr-QpzJF-y5dfNFjKg,26,2014-11-09,15,hBaEL0VPuuRQc9CiKMcsSA,5,"Michael U and I decided to try this new place.  We made a 6:30 reservation for the Chef's Counter.  On arrival, we were greeted and promptly seated.  The two sided, 20 seat Chef's Counter is the remnants of what was a sushi restaurant at this location.  The other restaurant seating consists of booths one one side along the wall and the side toward the windows consists of tables but not booths.  The Chef's Counter gives you the chance to see some of the work being done by the chefs.

We ordered 22 plates and asked our server, Sean, to arrange them in courses which he did quite well.  The menu lists items as bread, beef, whitefish, etc. and then describes the ingredients.  Over the next two and a half hours, we had:

Salmon belly amuse-bouche
Simulated sea water with uni and seaweed amuse-bouche
Bread
Corn bisque soup
Yellowtail salad
Scallop plate with tamari, finger lime and tobiko
Mushroom bruschetta plate
Foie gras
Jumbo lump crab cake
Rice with uni, salmon, and reggiano cream
Boudin blanc
Berkshire pork belly with pear
Chicken with green chile and macaroni
Black tiger shrimp
Duck leg confit
House made lo mein noodles with garlic, more garlic
Lamb t-bone with shishito peppers
Beef tenderloin
Yukon gold scalloped potatoes
Sticky apricot pudding with vanilla cream and rum toffee
Chocolate feuilletine crunch
Crème brûlée
Eposisses cheese with quince and truffle honey
Truffle gouda with fig and marcona almond
Chocolate truffles with basil with the bill

We shared everything except for getting two orders of bread and soup.

Rather than go over everything, I'll try to mention my favorites although there was nothing that wasn't excellent!  The scallop on rice with lime was stunning in how good it was.  The lime in the rice just made the scallop shine.  The rice with uni was very creamy and tasty.  The noodles with garlic and more garlic was a stand out for sure.  House made lo mein noodles with lots of garlic and some scallions was superb!  The chicken and a nice zing with spices and the black tiger shrimp were equally spicy.  We ended the meal with a trio of desserts--all excellent--and two very good cheese courses.  Finally were were brought two homemade chocolate truffles with basil.  What a great addition for a chocolate truffle.

Sean delivered some of the plates and explained their ingredients.  Sometimes another server would bring the dishes and explain.  Sean tried to get around to do some more in depth explanation.  Service was excellent.  It matched the food.

Chef Clawson's restaurant has been open for about 5 weeks.  The menu is well thought out with a diverse list of items from which to choose.  We tried almost everything but it would be a great place to come and have one or two items and some drinks.

It certainly was worth the trip to the other side of town to try Clawson's restaurant.  A great menu with all items very well executed!",27,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

When I hike this trail, it's because I'm hiking through what's known as White Owl Canyon and after going through some pipes to get to the old road, I return to the car by joining the Shoreline Trail about a mile from the parking area for 33 Hole and the 3 Islands Lookout.

Some volunteers have done some nice work over the last couple of years by placing boulders along the trail so one knows where to go.  This section has changed over the 7 years or so that I've been hiking the trail.  The boulders work now because the level of the lake has fallen so much there's little danger that the trail will be covered by water and the rocks become useless.  In fact, it has been very discouraging to watch the level of the lake drop so much that you now have to leave the trail to get to the edge of a stream that was once the lake.

I passed on the tortillas and had rye toast instead.  The skillet was very good!  The home fries were very hot with lots of cheese on them.  The salsa verde and the chorizo went well with the potatoes to make a super skillet.  I had coffee with my breakfast.

When I was here in May to see Pin Up, I walked around the casino to see if anything had changed because I hadn't been to the Stratosphere in many years.  As I was walking around, McCall's caught my eye.  I didn't see a menu outside but I checked it out when I got home.  Since I had a ticket to see Frankie Moreno last night, I made a reservation at McCall's to give the place a try.

I started out getting the PBB&J crostini, something I'd read in Yelp reviews.  How could I resist?  It's 4 slices of toasted baguette with peanut butter, bacon, bleu cheese and drizzled with jalapeño jelly on a bed of some shredded lettuce, sliced cucumber, red onion, and some red bell pepper.  It is excellent and what a different start to a meal.  The only thing I'd do differently is to up the jalapeño in the jelly and give it some kick.  The appetizer was delightful!  While eating the crostini, a server brought the bread basket.  Wow!  What a selection!  I had one cheese stick because I had enough bread with the crostini and I didn't want to fill up on bread.

For the main course, I got the coffee rubbed NY Strip steak with bleu cheese butter.  I got a side of their cheese croquettes.  The steak was done perfectly, charred on the outside, blue on the inside.  The cheese croquettes were good but I would have used more cheese or a stronger cheese.  It just didn't have a strong cheese flavor.  Both dishes had very thin slices of leeks that were blanched in hot oil just enough to give them a crisp.  What a tasty and different topping to food rather than a sprig of parsley!

Yes, of course I had room for dessert, and I ordered the triple chocolate flourless cake.  It was very good.  Rich chocolate with whipped cream that was thick and seemed to have some mascarpone whipped in.  

Service was excellent.  Everyone at McCall's had a smile, greeted customers very pleasantly, and were courteous and helpful and it started with the hostess.  My server was VInce and he was top notch.  He checked back with me every course at least once, and he refilled my iced tea without me needing to ask.  The only service fail was my obsession with keeping the table clean.  It wasn't until the end of the meal that a server removed my three empty artificial sugar packets.  That's my gold standard of excellent service all other things being equal.

That then became my second dish.  As I was carrying my tray to the table, the woman asled me what kind of soup I wanted.  She decided I should have chicken soup and she filled a styrofoam cup with soup.

The soup was very good.  This was homemade and the broth was rich.  The lechon was a bit dry but I guess I shouldn't expect anything else.  It's a fast food place with the dishes already prepared and in warming trays like a buffet.  Of course it's going to be a bit try.  The skin was very crispy and flavorful and the dipping sauce you get made up for some of the dryness of the lechon.  I had never had the tortang dulong before and I'm glad I tried it.  The fish in the omelette was a good fit.  The omelette could have been hotter--heat lamps only do so much, but it was enjoyable.

Customer service was great!  The woman was being a surrogate sister for me making sure I had my soup with this hearty meal.  The price was certainly right, and the location was perfect!",14,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

-The sushi here is quite good, very fresh and flavorful

-They have an all-you-can-eat menu, for around 20 dollars per person on Friday, Sunday, and Wednesday, BUT.... service is verrrrrry slugggishhhhh... especially if you are starving and want sushi now!

- Also, they are very restrictive about what you are allowed to get, so it's more like all-we-choose-for-you-to-eat 

-For instance, each person is only allowed 2 special rolls (although their regular rolls are still unlimited), and if you do not finish your sushi by the end of your meal you will be charged the regular price for it.  Ouch!  I mean, I can see how it's a good policy to eliminate waste, but to be charged the full price of a roll (which is around 10 dollars) for leaving one piece on your plate?

- So, the food itself is good, I'd say 4 stars, but since I was turned off by their all-you-can-eat policies and slow service, minus one star.

-Oh, and they have really cute earrings and necklaces for sale at the front counter.  I was tempted to buy some earrings, but, after waiting a minute and seeing that they weren't even going over to the counter to answer the phone while I was there, I decided I can live without earrings bought from a Sushi restaurant.",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
f-Tr1CGq7u0JIej6GH2Y1w,6,2015-12-18,4,D0TrV_OJ0TdK8xcy0SSH2A,2,"I wanted to take this tour for three reasons: to see the plane, the horses, and the house.  I purchased my ticket online and came early and they were able to put me on a earlier tour.

First, you watch a 15 minute movie about Wayne Newton and his career.  It's very interesting.  I caution the reader, however, that this tour is for middle aged people and older.  It is not for millennials or anyone under 35 unless they know Wayne Newton for some reason.

After the movie, you board a shuttle that takes you across the Sunset Road and in the front gates to the estate.  The stops are in the following order:  the plane at the museum, then the car part of the museum, then costumes Newton wore during part of his career along with photos, letters, and other memorabilia, some of it very interesting.  

Then you go to the horse area where there is a bleacher setup.  Two Arabians are brought one at a time to the arena and they show how well trained they are and how beautiful they are.  What majestic animals!

From here, it's off to the exotic animal area, then the house and then back to the store/ticket office.

My favorite things of the tour were the plane and the Arabians.  Very enjoyable and informative.  I applaud Newton for the many USO trips he made.  He deserves every honor for that.

My problems with the tour are several.  Some of the tour is repetitive.  Some of what is seen in the movie is repeated at the museum or in other places on the tour.  In the auto section of the museum, it would be nice to have a stand with the info on each car for one to read. Instead, the tour leader readers from notebook sheets the year of the car, the make of Rolls (if it is), and who owned it prior to Newton obtaining it if it was someone famous.  This takes so much time doing 10 cars one at a time.

The exotic animal area is a bit forlorn.  There was a beautiful electus parrot out when I was there and many peacocks roaming around, but like any other ""zoo,"" the animals are sometimes not easy to see as they're behind wire mesh to keep them in and safe.

Now the main reason for my poor review.  With no announcement made by our tour leader, some of the group I was with got on the shuttle and in a moment or so, the bus started and before I knew it, we were back at the museum/ticket office area.  As the driver was leaving, I saw the rest of our group walking to the house so I never got to see the house.

I filled out a comment form on their website, and the next day I got a call from a woman apologizing for the mixup.  She didn't know why it happened or why some of the people were coming back early.  She told me she'd send me an email and when I received it, I should list three dates when I could come back to finish my tour and see the house.  I got the email, I responded, and almost two weeks later, I have heard nothing back.  What had been great customer relations turned out to be awful customer relations.

The other thing I'd give as a negative of the tour (I bought the platinum--the most expensive--tour) is just too long.  Three hours?  You have to be a real fan of Newton to spend 3 to 3.5 hours on this tour.  Maybe that's why part of the group returned before the end of the tour but the tour leader should have made an announcement.  We were all on the same platinum tour.

If you're a fan of Newton and you have time to spend while visiting Las Vegas, this would be interesting.  If you have other plans, allow plenty of time so time constraints don't become an issue.",20,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Six of us ordered a lot of things from the menu and shared everything.  Items ordered were:

Foie gras conserva
Spanish Osetra caviar
Potato 'tortilla'
Roasted eggplant dip
Baked Monte Enebro
Paella Valenciana
Black kale fritters
Fried oysters
Medjool dates
Bacalao
Grilled octopus
Bone marrow dip
Chicken croquetas
Patatas bravas
Saffron 'alioli'
Frozen nougat
Arroz con leche
Chocolate and almond cake
Bunuelos

The top dish of this meal was the paella. The Valenciana has rabbit, snails, and broad beans.  The rice was crisp on the bottom and the proteins were perfect.  Next in my favorites is the baked Monte Enebro.  The melted cheese topped with caramelized onions and pistachio crust was excellent.  The cheese flavor was strong and the pistachio pieces made a good texture enhancement.  My third favorite was the Bacalao cod.  The salted fish was very flavorful with the olives and fennel especially adding to the flavor.  If you come here, a must would be the frozen nougat for dessert.  It is delicious!

The other tapas plates we tried were good for the most part but there was nothing that grabbed me.  The Medjool dates were good but there are a number of places that do dates just as well.  I found the foie gras disappointing and the bone marrow dip was OK but lacking in the flavor I get from bone marrow from the bone instead of melted into a dish.

The restaurant just opened so I have to give the servers a little slack.  Everyone was very pleasant but it was the little things that pull down my opinion.  We were not given fresh plates during the tasting but got them before dessert when the table was cleaned for the desserts.  In cleaning, a server took my water glass and it wasn't replaced.  There is a lack of bread--toast points, etc.--with the tapas.  While there wasn't much foie gras to the serving, three small triangles is not enough to try the foie and the apricot jam that accompanied the dish.

The bread had good flavor and was grilled to a delightful crispness. The roast beef was good too, and I liked the piquant chimichurri that went with it.

When we entered we were greeted warmly by one of the waitresses and were promptly seated.  We ordered the garlic dipping oil to start with ($7.95), which came with small freshly baked bread pieces, a generous amount of pumpkin seed oil with freshly chopped garlic and jalapeno.  Although the pumpkin seed oil had a nice, nutty flavor, and the garlic and jalapeno were fresh, it tasted bland as a whole.  What I would recommend is to add salt, pepper, and Parmesan from the shakers to the dip and it will taste 10 times better!

We ordered the Four Seasons, which came out in a unique presentation.  The whole pizza is covered with prosciutto, but then each 1/4 of the pizza has a different vegetable covering it, to represent each season (Artichoke, olive, tomato, and mushroom).  You can also order all the ingredients mixed in equally on the pizza if you wish, but we decided to go with what the restaurant recommended, and we were glad we did!  It was nice to have a different ingredient on each slice I ate.  It made me feel like I was eating 4 different pizzas.  The crust was initially crisp, but the center does get bogged down and a little soggy as the more watery ingredients start to infuse into the crust, but it doesn't detract from the taste too much.  Although it was a bit pricey ($17.95), the ingredients were high quality and there was a healthy amount of ingredient on each part of the pizza.  

I also ordered the red sangria, which was smooth, and fruity from the addition of orange juice to the wine and brandy.  Minus some points for using generic canned fruit cocktail instead of fresh fruit in the sangria glass, especially if I'm paying $8.95 for it!

I got the chips and salsa and I asked for the hot salsa.  That salsa with habanero peppers is quite good.  The mild salsa is fine, too, and I liked the small bits of avocado in the mild salsa.

I had read reviews of friends on Yelp and had decided what I was going to get before I got there.  Then I looked at the menu there and I changed my mind.  While we were studying the menu, our server brought our drinks and he kept my iced tea refilled during the meal.

I opted for the Hubert Keller burger which is ground buffalo meat.  It's topped with caramelized onions, bleu cheese, and baby spinach served on a ciabatta bun.  Finally, it's served with a red wine and shallot sauce which the menu states is Keller's favorite sauce.  I ordered the burger rare.

I also got a side of skinny fries which were good but nothing special.  It was also a small amount for the price.  As for Chef Keller's favorite sauce, I didn't find it all that flavorful.

I have driven by it numerous times, I probably have noticed it, but it never clicked in my head to stop.  This small trailer is in the corner of the convenience mart at the southwest corner of DI and Valley View.  There is little parking near the trailer itself, so I parked along the north side of the mart.

I walked over and looked at the flavors and the man showed me two sizes of cups.  You could have up to three flavors in the smaller size I chose which had to be equivalent to a pint.  I chose coconut and banana.  There was a $2 off Yelp check in offer which the man was surprised was still available on Yelp but he honored it making my ice cream $8.  That's pricey for a pint but it is quality, locally made ice cream.  The ice cream maker on display moves and it looks like ice cream is being frozen but it isn't making ice cream.  The gentleman told me the health department won't allow that to make ice cream but they have two others off site where the ice cream is made.

I took my cup back to my car and enjoyed the ice cream.  Both flavors were very good with rich flavor.  I won't be stopping here often as I'm usually going by to get to some place I need to be.  I also am not a fan of eating in my car.  I like sit down places more, but this is good stuff!",10,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I was taken to the back left of the restaurant.  I really like the way the place has been changed.  The large room has been subdivided into several smaller areas that keep the noise to a minimum and also give you a feel of being in a smaller place than it is.

Complimentary chips and two salsas were brought.  The chips were nondescript and the salsas were OK.  The green tomatillo wasn't as flavorful as the red which also had some spiciness to it.

I started with pozole.  It was good tasting.  I was surprised that the corn had been not left whole but had been chopped.  I guess it's just their way but I hadn't seen pozole like this before.  There was a nice seasoning to the soup.

For the main course, I had pollo barracho, drunken chicken.  Along with the chicken were some mixed vegetables in a cream sauce and what I call and open face tamal.  The chicken was cooked and sliced and was served with a sauce that was more a tomatillo than a barracho.  There were no olives and there was no olive flavoring, something I expect with barracho.  The vegetables were good.  It was a mixture of carrot, corn, zucchini and tomato cubes  coated with a thick sauce.  I called it an open face tamal because the masa filling was placed on top of some fold corn husks and one didn't have to open the husks to get to the filling as you normally do.

Time for dessert and I got the raspberry tres leches.  The menu describes it as vanilla tres leche trifle with raspberry compote and a cinnamon sugar buñuelo (Mexican style).  The dessert was really good.  The trifle with the raspberry was great!

Service was good.  The pace was perfect.  There was ample time between courses.  I was never tapping my foot waiting for something to be brought, either.  My server checked on my several times while I was there and my iced tea was refilled without asking.",5,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Crispy oysters
Endive and date salad
Date and bleu cheese jam spread
Spicy shrimp
Three beans
Mini burgers
Whole smoked romanesco
Meatball sliders
Kimchi tacos
Ribeye cap
Fruit loop panna cotta
Lost bread

The crispy oysters and the date and bleu cheese jam were repeats and just as good as the first time.  Some of the new items we tried that were amazing were the three beans, spicy shrimp, and whole smoked romanesco.  I had never seen a romanesco in a store but I was blown away by the great flavor with the red onions, capers, raisins, and herbs.  The smoking gives it a fantastic flavor.  The spicy shrimp lived up to their name and I could have eaten the entire serving myself.  Finally, the three beans with a house XO, fish sauce, and garlic.  The beans were crisp, spicy, and very tasty.

For dessert, the fruit loop panna cotta was not available the first go round.  This time it was and it's quite good and what a take on a cereal.  The lost bread--pain perdu--was better than the first time around.  The cinnamon flavor comes from being made from cinnamon rolls and the bread was moist throughout.

The bar is called a dive bar and I guess you could say it is although it was a lot nicer than I was expecting and there was a lot less smoke than I thought there would be.  The place is small.  A narrow aisle past the bar to the performance area in the back is the only space to move around.  As we gathered in the back, we tended to block the entrance to the ladies room.  

The bartender from whom I got my Coke was very kind and the price was right.  

There were some problems with mic feedback at times, but nothing serious.  The band rocked the joint and it was great fun to see and hear a friend lead his band with his great fiddle playing!

It was a fun night and the Lounge was great.  I'd like to go back sometime and get photos of the whole Frank Bowers mural behind the bar.  Bowers was a Los Angeles mural painter who is said to have painted this mural to pay off a bar tab.",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I got the order to go and it was packaged well, all ready to go when I came in to pick it up. The lunch special includes a generous portion of curry, a mound of white rice, salad, and a tiny little egg roll. The egg roll had a ton of wrapping with a small amount of filling. The rice was very slightly crunchy tasting in some parts. The red curry was lighter and a little sweeter tasting than other versions I've had and was watery. The salad had a peanut dressing on it which tasted decent.

The tom kha gai was also a sizeable portion of soup, filled with chicken and vegetables. The soup was actually thicker than the curry, and had a strong sour flavor. 

Service was friendly and polite at the counter.

Yesterday on the way home from a play at UNLV, I had this place in mind for quick take out before going to the evening play for which we had tickets.

I had looked at the menu online and had already decided I'd get a square (thick crust) white pizza with some toppings I chose.  They've changed their menus and I ask the greeter if I could still get the white pizza.  She told me too different kinds I could get and I opted for the white truffle with mushrooms.

I agree with Nelson Q. that there was so much garlic that it hid the truffle flavor.  The pizza was very good nonetheless.  There was a lot of garlic and there were many mushrooms.  My only negative comment would be that some areas of the pizza were baked to a black crust rather than an evenly done one.

Service was pretty good.  I waited about 15 minutes for it to be ready.  The greeter asked me if I'd like some water while I was waiting--a nice touch.

I almost wished that my wife was with me so we could have stayed there and eaten in their patio area with just enough shrubs and trees to make Hualapai Commons and the cars almost disappear.  Instead, I got my hands greasy and salty at the kitchen table. 

I also long for the menu at pizza places where you have the blank canvas and get your white pizza with toppings x, y, and z.  You can still do that some places but it seems to be a disappearing thing at the more upscale places.",5,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I like the sliced cucumbers and their spicy hot green salsa.  It was very good.  On the lengua, I put some pineapple which made the flavor of the tongue stand out.

The junior beef was a pretty hefty portion of meat and bread. The sandwiches come with just meat, and if you want provolone, hot, or sweet peppers it will be $.60 extra per topping. I opted to have it with hot and sweet peppers, but I think the provolone would have helped the sandwich taste even better.

The bread was good. It had a crusty, yet chewy quality, which held up to the juices and broth from the beef. The beef was tender, and a generous heaping, but I would have liked some more flavor in the broth to bring an even greater dimension to the sandwich. The sandwich seemed like it was dipped half-way, since one side was juicy while the other was dry. I would have liked the sandwich to be dipped more so that it was uniformly soaked in rich brothy goodness. 

Compared to another Italian beef I've had in the Phoenix area at Lobby's in Tempe, while the portions are bigger at Lukes, I like the taste of the sandwich better at Lobby's as a whole. 

I liked the Chicago dog better than the Italian beef. It had all the right condiments, right down to the peppers and poppy seed bun. The hot dog itself was cooked just right, with a lot of flavor. In Chicago dog-dom, I crown Luke's the winner vs. Lobby's version.

Since we were on a limited time schedule for lunch, we appreciated the lightning quick service as our meals were ready as soon as we filled up our soda drink and sat down.

Located in the heart of downtown Chandler, Peixoto is in its sophomore year of serving up caffeinated delights to the East Valley with no signs of slowing down.

The deep potent espresso elixir poured over the chocolate hazelnut gelato was a delightful combination of hot with cold, and bitter with sweet. Julia came over and gave us a sample of her favorite Bourbon vanilla gelato and I was even more amazed! It was so creamy rich, packed with vanilla essence and had a bit of coconut undertone at the end.

The iced chai was absolutely delicious, one of the best iced chai drinks I've had. It was beautifully presented, with a rich, velvety foam on top, a dusting of cinnamon, and a lovely chai flavor that reminded me of the great chai tea they serve at Indian restaurants. The vermicelli was equally as beautiful to behold, and had a wonderful combination of textures, temperatures, and flavors, from the grilled faux beef, the soft rice noodles, lettuce, spring rolls, shredded carrots, radish cucumber, and sauce. It was a hearty meal that I could have easily shared with another person. The banh mi was also quite delectable, with a light, airy bread with crispy outer crunch, the tender faux chicken, and crunchy pickled vegetables.

Someone decided it would be cool looking to have a metal frame that holds chips on the bottom and 3 bowls on the top for the salsas.  They are fixed--they don't move lazy Susan style.  It makes it a bit challenging to reach up into one of the small bowls to retrieve some red salsa (no heat), tomatillo salsa, or pico.  If my wife had been with me, those little bowls would have been removed and placed on the table for easier dipping.  But, it does look different.

I ordered the carnitas dish.  While another reviewer noted the saltiness of the dishes, I looked for salt and pepper on my table.  There is absolutely NONE!  I guess you have to ask for it.  There was also NO Cholula nor Tapatio on any table.  By the time I got my server to stop long enough, I was 2/3 of the way through my meal.  Is this really a Tex-Mex place?  My carnitas were OK but nothing that I can't get in any number of places around town for a lot less.  The redeeming part of the meal was dessert.  The crèpes were quite good and the ice cream in the sweetened tortilla bowl was very good and a great ending to a lackluster meal.

I stumbled upon Car Beyond actually on Amazon, but then saw the local area code and found out that their store is in the Phoenix area! I was looking for a gift for a friend, and found a Wonder Woman DC Comic brand emblem for her car I thought she'd like. 

The current address is on 78th St (They moved recently), and the store can be a little difficult to find. If you keep a constant eye out you'll be able to find the ""15982"" sign on a nondescript, brown building. There is no sign (Yet?) on the suite saying ""Car Beyond"", so if you're looking for this store go to Suite C.

The store is catered more towards online orders so there is not much of a showroom, but the staff here are friendly and helpful. You can buy various accessories for your car here, from decorative adhesive emblems to seat belts. Although most of their inventory focuses on the particular make of your car, they do sell some novelty accessories such as the DC emblem I bought. 

Upon check out, the associate was very nice and wanted to make sure I got the lowest price listed online. He also mentioned that exchanges could be easily done if my friend decided to get something different. The emblem was around $24 and made in the U.S.A.

I'm not sure how my experience would have gone if I had ordered online, but solely based on my shopping experience at the actual store here, I'm a fan! If they had more selection for the pop-culture type accessories, I would be tempted to get something from here too!",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The restaurant had a fairly steady stream of customers here, always a good sign! The buffet had a good mix of vegetable, fried, and meat dishes. Dishes today included saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, and biriyani. My favorites were the fish curry and the malai kofta (Vegetable fritters in curry sauce). 

Dessert consisted of gulab jamun, kheer, fresh watermelon, and carrot halwa. The dishes all tasted pretty good, no complaints on my end! The spice level was just right for a buffet. Not too mild but with a slight kick to make it about a low to medium level for me.

Service was friendly and attentive. In addition to the buffet items they will bring fresh naan to your table which was plentiful and refilled as needed.

I stepped inside and liked the retro feel of this place. It was a busy morning for them on Friday at 9 A.M., but service was still cheerful and friendly. I decided to get an order to go at the counter to the side of the entrance. 

I ordered the #2 breakfast special: Corned beef hash, potatoes, 2 eggs, and toast. Quite a lot of food for only $6! You get your choice of how you want your eggs cooked, and type of potatoes and toast. I decided on poached eggs, country potatoes, and wheat toast.

I only waited maybe 5 minutes for my order. Wow they are fast! Driving home, the delicious savory smells wafted through my car, increasing my hunger for breakfast! I opened up the to-go boxes and found hearty portions of each component of my meal. They were as follows:

Corned beef hash: Looked like it came straight from a can (Perhaps a Hormel can?) Tasty nonetheless (I grew up on that stuff!), and it looked like they dumped the whole can's contents, griddled it, and put it in my meal.

Country potatoes: Perfectly cooked and griddled, with a good savory taste.

Poached eggs: They came in a small Styrofoam cup with lid to keep the other parts of my meal from getting soggy. The yolks were a little more hard-cooked than I usually like.

Toast: The weakest part of the meal. I got 2 whole slices of buttered wheat toast, but each slice was burnt. The toast came with one packet of grape jelly.

Overall, it was a lot of food for the amount I paid, and I ate everything (Except the really burnt parts of the toast) with gusto. They accept cash or check only, which keeps prices down. 

Since it was cold outside that morning, I didn't venture out to the patio area, but it looked nice. One of these days, in nicer weather, I'd like to try it out. I hear they are dog-friendly too, so maybe my pup will come along for the ride!",5,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I ordered the baked ricotta, the poached king salmon, and the peanut butter lava cake.  The baked ricotta was served with truffle honey and toast points.  Very tasty.  I did let one of the pieces of bread go back so I didn't fill up with that.  I'm not much of a honey person but the honey on the toast and then the hot ricotta on top made for a combination that was very good.

The poached salmon was excellent.  Perfectly cooked, it was a nice pink inside.  The salmon sat on a bed of eggplant, chick peas, and herbed yogurt.  An excellent, healthy main course.

I asked my server about two possible dessert choices.  His recommendation--the peanut butter lava cake--and his suggestion was great.  The peanut butter cake was filled with wonderful butterscotch that oozed out when I broke the surface.  There was also some brown butter ice cream served with the cake.

Finishing this task, though a chore, would be my crowning achievement.  Enter a friend who offered to give me two tickets!  Yes, the price is right and I'm set to go.  My wife is not a late show person, so I met a fellow Yelpie, Tony T, at the Peepshow Theatre at Planet Hollywood last night.

I was not disappointed.  The premise of the show is a bit weak.  I guess with a show like this, I really didn't plan on going for the story line, so this wasn't too much of a drawback.  Holly Madison is gorgeous.  Her role is limited to brief appearances to move the story along.  In the last scene, we get to see the real Madison and it's worth the wait. 

The music is quite good.  There are some very good singers on that stage.  The ""Feelin' Good"" number is very well done!  The scene with Timber is excellent.  His strength is amazing.  

Finally, the one scene that was the best for the night was the giant milk bath.  The three ladies in the vat were quite good.  This part of the show was quite clever and it was staged beautifully.  It brought a big smile to my face.  Got milk?

I'd go again to see this show.  The ladies are quite pretty and the vibe of the place is so Las Vegas.

Edit:  After reading Tony T's review, I remembered I wanted to mention being totally blinded near the beginning of the show when the dancers stand in front of a huge Peepshow lighted display that is so bright you are literally blinded for a second.

SR3kKXob2PtBPop_pNxIvg,3,2011-01-01,2,LusyCg9CgxS0QLKv1zC6QQ,5,"Calico Tanks is a moderate 2.5 mile out and back hike at Red Rock Canyon.  To get to the trailhead, take the Scenic Drive to the 3rd parking area, Sandstone Quarry, and hike the trail that goes out from the west end of the parking lot by the wooden fence posts.

There is about 500 foot elevation gain/loss.  Some of the trail is packed gravel, some is soft sand, some is made up of large rocks that make you watch your footing carefully, and some of the hike is going over sandstone.  In short, this hike has a little something of every kind of terrain.  And, if you're lucky, you'll see some water in the tanks (natural depressions or erosion of the sandstone) that hold water until it evaporates.  

After you start hiking, you'll pass an historically significant area where there once was a quarrying operation in the early 1900s.  Stop and look at the blocks abandoned there around 1913 and read the interpretive marker about ""The Big Devil.""  From here the hike crosses a double wash and then continues until you reach a fork in the trail and Calico Tanks goes off to the right.  You'll come around the back of the sandstone you see in the parking lot and you enter a canyon with sandstone walls on both sides.

The trail is fairly evident most of the way.  There are a few places that people have placed cairns to help guide you.  As long as you're going up the canyon, you'll be OK.  The worst that can happen is you get yourself in an area where you're stuck on a ledge.  You may have to retrace your steps and go the other side of the sandy area,

The payoff is reaching the large tank at the end of the trail.  Today, January 1, 2011, there was a large amount of water in the tank from our recent rains.  The top had a good coating of ice.  Enjoy the tank which is dry most of the year.  Then head a little more east and you'll get to an overlook where you can see the Las Vegas Valley.  There are two routes to accomplish this:  1) go along the base of the tank and climb the rocks up the small chute on the opposite side; or, 2) when you reach the tank, stay high on the hill on the right and boulder scramble along a path that leads you to the same area.  Take what you find easiest.  This is a good place to have a snack and to do some exploring.

Retrace your steps to the parking area.  Before you get back to the trail junction with the Turtlehead Peak trail, you'll see and interpretive marker on your right hand side.  This is for an Indian roasting pit.  It's a mound beyond the marker where they cooked their food using the agave plant which is common in Red Rock.  Make sure you see this historical spot, too!

TIP:  This is one of the most popular trails at Red Rock Canyon, so if you go on a weekend, get there early as the parking lot fills up quickly.

They serve fish in tortillas :) The menu is limited to mainly tacos and quesadillas and you can have your fish in various ways: fried, marinated, combined with shrimp, etc. For those that aren't in a seafood mood they do offer chicken and barbacoa. I had a fish machaca taco and a campechano taco. Both were around $3-4 each. I was initially confused because I associate the word machaca with shredded marinated beef. I then found out that machaca is also a type of Central American fish. Anyways, the machaca was flavorful with a citrus-y kick. The campechano taco had battered and fried shrimp and fish. The batter was light and tasted crisp against the tender texture of the fish. The shrimp were very slightly tough though. The name shouldn't be confused with campechana, a cold seafood dish in a tomato-based sauce (I did have some confusion there until I realized it was a different name. Basically there was a lot of word confusion going on in my head today : ) ).

The condiment/salsa bar has a myriad of options for your taco. Tartar sauce, shredded cabbage, various heat levels of salsa, and limes are just a few of the sides available. The very hot salsa is aptly named and definitely packs a punch!

The tacos have a soft corn tortilla shell, double layered and steamed. While they were decent as a vehicle to hold the meat inside, a little grilling would help add some texture and added flavor to the taco.

I came here around 12:30 and there were no seats left in the restaurant. I was originally intending to eat here but I decided to get my order to go since there was nowhere for me to actually sit and eat my tacos.

Snagging the last outside table available, we browsed through the menu after the waitress came over to take our drink order.

We ordered a vast quantity of food, enough to feed quite possibly a small army. We arrived just a few minutes before happy hour ended at 7 P.M., so we were lucky enough to partake in happy hour bites as well as regular dinner items. Our array of food included takoyaki, grilled meats, oyako don, spicy miso noodle soup with tofu, ""The hot rock"", sashimi, agedashi tofu, and a massive array of sushi rolls. Out of all the items, my favorites were the takoyaki and the spicy noodle soup. The takoyaki tasted freshly made, with a nice crispy outer shell and big chunks of octopus. The spicy noodle soup had perfectly cooked noodles, with a light broth. The sashimi was fresh, and while the rolls we had were cheap (Approximately 5-6 dollars per roll), you get what you pay for since they were plentiful numbers of them, but they tasted just OK, nothing special. The hot rock was an interesting creation, which I enjoyed. It had a shitake mushroom base, and was topped with cooked spicy tuna, crab, and eel sauce.

Service was friendly, but due to the popularity of the restaurant (There were a lot people waiting inside, and a huge line of people waiting outside the restaurant as more time progressed during our meal), our waitress was a bit absent minded about getting items for us and checking up on us. 

The owner is Taiwanese, so the menu isn't strictly Japanese by authenticity standards. Just think of it as Japanese with some Chinese flair. :)

I'll come back here if I'm wanting good takoyaki and other small bites, and if I'm planning on eating here at a less busier time. If you do come at a typically busy time, you've been warned about the wait and limited seating!

I'm usually a lightweight when it comes to finishing meals, but in this case, I cleaned my plate!  The salsa tastes good, but is very watery which makes it hard to eat with chips.  We ordered iced teas and they were refilled promptly as needed.  I'd definitely be interested in going here again for some tasty and filling meals.",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We got there 15 minutes before the show supposedly started, and there was a huge line to get in for parking. There was also a huge line to enter the venue. Since there were so many people attending, I figure this was understandable given the sheer volume of patrons.

While the show was advertised at starting from 5-10 P.M. on the website, it didn't actually start until more like 5:45-6, with Dave Chappelle at the very end at 10:30ish (He was advertised on a few small handwritten signs near the entrance as starting at 10). 

Drinks and food were pricey, due to the monopoly the venue had on eating and drinking options (You are not allowed back in after you exit). We didn't feel like paying $9 for a hot dog, or $10 for a burrito, so we toughed it out until the end of the show and got some late night eats afterwards.

The seats are hard plastic, which was fine to sit in around 5ish when temps were reasonable, but I'm not sure how hot they would be in summer temperatures. The seats themselves are kind of narrow, and you might be bumping shoulders and arms with your neighbor.

While the huge fans overhead are nice when it's hot outside, as the temps got cooler, we were blasted by the fans and the wind and I was very cold in my seat at night since we were directly above the fan

If you are sensitive to smoke, in either cigarette or ""medical"" variety, this is not the place for you. This is pretty much to be expected since you are in an outdoor venue. I wasn't sitting in direct contact with any smokers, but I could still smell various smoke fumes from rows away.

Not all the seats are covered, so if you are getting a seat on the side, make sure it is as close to the center as possible if you want to avoid sitting in the sun with no shade.

Overall, meh. While I'm glad I got to see Dave Chappelle live, it's going to take a really phenomenal show to entice me to go to the Ak-Chin Pavilion again.",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The theatre seating is divided into three sections.  There are floor seats, theatre style seats, that are in front of the stage.  Behind these are raised seats that go up levels for good viewing.  There's a third seating area on the north side of the theatre like the rear seating.

There are a couple of shows running there on a regular basis.  One is Red Dress and the other is Tribal Night which is held the last Thursday of the month.  There are shows on other dates and it's good top check the website to see what may be playing.  There is a regularly scheduled Reggae night, too.

The theatre is perfect for the kind of shows done there.  If you're interested, there's a bar in the lobby that sells soda and alcoholic drinks.

The restaurant is fairly small but it's very nicely appointed with tablecloths even for the lunch buffet.  Nice touch.  There is no TV so you won't be watching Indian MTV.  Instead, there's quiet music playing in the restaurant which makes it conducive to conversation.

The pakoras and samosa I had were probably the best I've had on a buffet.  Crispy coatings that had not become softened by sitting in the warming pans.  Very tasty fillings also.  The chicken curry had some bite to it which is always a plus.

While enjoying my first plate, I was brought naan.  There was no choice of garlic or plain naan.  Everyone gets plain naan.  I'd prefer garlic so this is a negative.  I had some chicken kabab which was different from what I was expecting.  It's ground chicken coated and cooked.  Something different but it didn't grab me.  The dahl curry with pakora was very good.  A different dish again and one I really liked.  The one piece of chicken tikka tandoori chicken I had was juicy and had a good flavor.  I finished my lunch with some very good kheer.

I missed the idly and samber (sambar) until I had eaten too much and didn't want to force more.  A good reason to return.  

Another negative was the lack of food in some of the containers.  There was one piece of bone in the goat curry and I didn't wait for more to be brought.  The same with the kheer.  I did ask for more and the container was refilled in the kitchen and brought out.

Service was quite good with water refills without asking and plates removed while at the buffet.  This could be a four star with a little bit of adjustment on making sure the pans have food in them and a choice of garlic naan would be nice.

I found the place very relaxing and the interior was very classy.",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I love cajun/Louisiana style cuisine and was excited to try out this restaurant based on the good reviews and close proximity to my house. The last time I had eaten Cajun food at a restaurant was actually in New Orleans. :) We ordered some hush puppies, boudin balls, I had the Cajun combination and shared some bread pudding.

The hush puppies and boudin balls were perfectly crispy on the outside, with tender filling. I loved the boudin balls. They tasted exactly like those I had in New Orleans. The Cajun combination was a great way to taste all the typical Louisiana style dishes. The crawfish etouffee was my favorite of the three bowls. The jambalaya was interesting in that it wasn't tomato based, so for me it tasted more like a Cajun spiced fried rice. Quite honestly I've had so many different versions of this dish (With a few that I've tried in Louisiana) it's still hard for me to say what a typical jambalaya is supposed to taste like. It tasted decent, but the rice was very slightly undercooked and thus very slightly crunchy tasting. I had the chicken and sausage gumbo which was flavorful and filled with meat and veggies. I tried my friend's seafood gumbo which was by far superior due to the smoky, intense flavor from the dark roux. I also loved the complimentary garlic bread which was buttery, garlicky, toasty heaven.

The bread pudding was a sizable chunk and came with a bowl of whiskey sauce (We asked for it on the side). It was thick, dense, and filled with a ton of ingredients such as nuts and shredded coconut. The sauce was very light and tasted more like very lightly sweet, watery whiskey.

Service was good and our drinks were filled as needed. Our waitress had the foresight to ask if we wanted separate checks or one single bill since we were a party of 6 which I appreciated. 

We went here on a Friday night and they had a musician singing and playing music, which might be a draw for some, but not so much if you are looking for more of a quiet environment where you can chat with friends. Good performance nonetheless by the musician.

I'll definitely come here if I'm craving Cajun style food for that lovely etouffee and seafood gumbo.",11,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The main problem here is the painstakingly slow service to get our food. We each ordered salads, mainly because we thought that would be the easiest item for the chefs to make. We ordered around 12:10-12:15, and had an excruciating wait for our food, which did not come all at the same time. My order came last, at 12:45, leaving me only a few minutes to eat before we had to get back to work at 1 P.M. 30 minutes to make a simple salad? Really?

When I actually got my salad, it was a fairly sizable portion. I had the roasted beet salad ($8), which included slices of roasted beets on the bottom layer, with mixed greens, candied pecans, and feta cheese. It was slightly overdressed, but overall decent. Too bad I only had a few minutes to eat it, as I tried to scarf as much down as possible in a short amount of time.

While they have a Coca Cola freestyle machine here for fizzy fountain drinks, their iced tea is made separately and has to be refilled by a server. The fountain drinks come in a plastic cup you can bring back with you, as opposed to the iced tea, which comes in a glass. Due to the slow service and our need to get back to work, I wasn't able to request a to-go cup or a refill on my tea so I could take it back, while the other people who got a fountain drink instead were able to take a refill to go.

The buffet is small but is in the size range of others.  At $11.99, it's price is OK.  Not the cheapest, not the most expensive.  The restaurant is attractive with comfortable seating.  There is a separate section through which you enter where the bar is located.  The buffet is in an adjoining area out of view from the dining room.

There was a selection of salad, yogurt, chutney, and desserts at the beginning of the buffet.  After the initial bar, there were several chafing dishes with various foods.  I tried the chicken tikka masala, a curry chicken, dal makhani, onion pakora, and some fried chicken balls--the name of which I can't remember.  Accompanying this was basmati rice.  

For the most part, the dishes were good and flavorful.  The dal was bland.  It could have used some seasoning.  The chicken balls were tasty and different.  I should have gotten some chutney for that and the onion pakora but I failed to do so.  Next time.  One of our group noted that the chicken tandoori was dry.  I didn't try this but noted this for future reference.  I made a second trip to the buffet to get something sweet to offset my disposition.  I got one gulab jamun and it was very good.  It was quite soft, and it was not overly sweet.  A very nice ending to lunch.

Service was average.  We were there when the restaurant opened and it soon got busy but there were a couple of people working the small room.  When I went to get my gulab, my dirty plate was not removed.  Other than this, things went OK.

If I'm in the area, I'd certainly stop again.  It is in the middle tier of Indian buffets I've tried.  Since it's the closest place to where I live, I'll be back.

We generally park near the bathrooms as the Yellow Trail leads out from there.  After a short walk, the yellow trail splits and goes off to the right.  We generally take the Red Trail which goes to the left and adds a greater distance to the hike than just doing the Yellow loop.

At the top of the ridge, the Red Trail heads north.  Don't take that unless you want to do many extra miles.  This is meant more for mountain biking and horseback riders.  We followed this trail once and came upon a group from the Great Basin Institute who were expanding the trail.  They assured us the trail was easy to follow.  It wasn't and after a couple of miles, we decided to go cross country back to the cars.  That's when the GPS unit comes in handy.

Instead of taking the Red Trail, we walk across the top of the ridge until we get to and old road that the Forest Service has blocked off.  We go down this steep road to get back to the Yellow Trail and follow it back to the cars.  If you keep going on the ridge, you're in for an 8.5 mile hike.

If you get one of the new trail maps at the Spring Mountain Gateway, you'll notice that the trails are not color coded anymore.  They have names for the two longer trails.

In any case, this is a good place to hike in a cooler area than Red Rock when it's hot in the summer and the views of Mummy Mountain and the playas on the east of the 95 give more outstanding views.  You'll often see planes from Nellis Air Force Base flying on their way to training exercises.

I went to see Bye, Bye Birdie yesterday at the church.  I was asked if I'd judge the 6 productions the company is doing during the 2013 season that began with Birdie.  

First, the venue is quite nice for doing a theatre piece, but it does have some drawbacks.  The scenery changes had to be done very carefully as there are three steps that go to the floor.  The youngsters and adults who were changing the scenery did so with flashlights so they could avoid a fall--quite understandable but something you don't see with most theatres.

The sound in the church was very good.  With some other theatres in Las Vegas, the person in the sound booth didn't turn on microphones quickly enough and some of the first words were not heard as well because the mic was not yet live. 

Given the nature of the ""stage the actors did a fine job in moving in and around set pieces.  At times, there were quite a few performers on stage which made the going a little difficult but they pulled it off well.

Brown has updated some of his material including an attempt to do some rap to appeal to a younger crowd.  The problem is, a younger crowd is generally not buying tickets for his show.

That's not a bad thing--it's merely what people like.

I'm sure I'll be heading back to see Gordie in another two years.  It was almost exactly two years since I saw him before last night and I enjoyed myself.  And, I still laughed at k-nock, k-nock!  If you don't understand that, go see his show!",5,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I came here yesterday for a play being performed in their auditorium.  The auditorium is large with comfortable seats that all have side boards for lifting up and putting in place to take notes if you were at a meeting or lecture.  The auditorium is directly to your right as you come in the front door.

After the play, I looked around the library to spend some time in their art gallery and to see the book area.  The book area is open and filled with light.  It's a very nice space.

The only question I had was the entrance.  Parking is both east and west of the main entrance to accommodate the double driveway with its book return area.  It seems like a waste of some extra parking spaces but then I'm not an architect nor traffic planner. 
On leaving, you can only make a right on Windmill from the area of the lot I left and there's no u-turn allowed when the island ends.  Instead, I went a little more west and made a U well past the no U turn sign.  Oops, Metro cars returning to their headquarters across the street from the library.  They didn't see me.  I guess the shift was over.

Unfortunately they only sell the fried chicken on the weekends here due to low demand on the weekdays (Boo... Who wouldn't want some gut bustin' crispy crunchy goodness on a weekday?). So, I was left to browse the menu for my little silver medal of meals. I ended up with the Jamaican spicy beef patty, a small side of collard greens, and a small mango-passion fruit juice.

The interior is pretty basic and is a small space but has a comfortable feel to it. The menu consists of various jerk meats, vegetable curry, Jamaican style patties, appetizers and sides. The meals only took a few minutes to make and came piping hot.

The collard greens were excellent. They had large chunks of meat in it, were perfectly seasoned, and were tender with a lot of smoky flavor. I wasn't a fan of the ""meat"" patty though. The dough was brightly yellow and had a good crispy flakiness, but my filling had an anemic amount of paste in it with no meat. It was also not spicy. There was actually more empty air pocket in the patty than filling. If you look at my cross section photo you'll see the big gaping hole where meat should be in the patty.

I tried some of the jerk chicken which was tender and nicely grilled. It tasted slightly too salty for my tastes though. 

The juice was very nice. It was a tropical tasting nectar that went well with our meals.

There are a plethora of hot sauces at each table for those that want to kick up the spice level, including a tasty Scotch bonnet pepper sauce.

Service was warm and friendly. The only other criticism I have is that this place closes really early, at 6 PM most days and at 5 PM on Saturday.

Sure, it's only $8 so I wasn't expecting a lot, but when there's a total of 6 or so people cleaning and drying your car in addition to the automated wash, shouldn't most of the dirt on your car be off?  There's still some dirt spots on the top of my car and towards the undercarriage there's no difference in the dirt streaks that were caked on the car before. 

Pluses: The car wash guys were fast and friendly, and the free vacuum stations are very nice. They also provide you with a very basic air freshener for free (Lemon, cherry, or baby powder scent). It's the type you place underneath your seat. I chose the lemon scent, which smelled a bit industrial, like there was pine-sol in my car.

They have a ""Sexy barista"" theme at their drink kiosk going on this spring and summer, where a bikini-clad girl will make your latte for you if you so desire (This also means they aren't selling donuts here right now, just muffins and coffee). Kind of weird to me, but to each their own!

It's a small casino.  I really can't remember much of the Lady Luck which used to be here as it closed so many years ago.

I did a walking tour of the casino and dining areas and it's all very pleasant.  I played for awhile and came away up $3.  Wow, big spender--major winner!

The runner had made arrangements with the house for a tasting menu for the three of us with specific dishes included in the tasting.  More on that later.

The evening started with our dual appetizers of Torchon foie gras and Paté de Campagne Bourguignon. The paté and foie gras were excellent with some frisée served with them.  We each got two slices of bread on which to spread the paté.  

Following this, we were brought escargots spätzle with chicken oyster, garlic, parsley coulis, and hazelnut.  The spätzle was soft and very tasty and the nut pieces for texture were a perfect addition.

Next came a course of sea scallops on a bed of corn.  The scallops were cooked on point and this, too, was a very tasty dish.

The the Tunisian lamb chop with some merguez sausage with cousocus, lemon braised spinach, red pepper tagine, and some chickpeas.  The chop was excellent, perfectly rare, and the spinach was very good.  The sausage had a small bit of spiciness to it.  Another winning dish.

For the last main, we got the crispy duck confit with a petite onion ring, trumpet royale mushroom, and some swiss chard and a small turnip.  Excellent duck.  

We then went to our dessert course.  We had ordered 6 items--a cheese plate with 5 selections, raspberry clafoutis, black and white fondant, Gateau Basque, ""Le Président"", and Madeleines.  The five cheeses were: Pierre Robert Triple crème, Humboldt Fog goat, Petit Basque sheep, Pennsylvania Noble cheddar, and Fourme d'Ambert bleu.  The cheese plate was served with cranberry bread, nuts, and quince preserves.  The cheese plate was outstanding!  My favorites were the triple crème and the bleu.  I often buy Petit Basque so that was nothing new for me.

The desserts were quite good.  Standouts here were the Gateau Basque, ""Le Président"" and the black and white fondant with verbena ice cream. ""Le Président"" was a chocolate-hazelnut mousse tort and coffee chantilly.  The gateau Basque was a custard cake, brandied cherries, and vanilla Anglaise.   The texture differences of ""Le Président""--the mousse tort with the bitter chocolate rings hiding the interior were wonderful together.  The gateau Basque was very smooth and quite a different cake than generally served.  With dessert, two of us had coffee and one had a single espresso.  

Throughout the meal, the waitstaff was excellent.  There was a little hesitancy with one server as the restaurant has only been open for about three weeks.  I was brought a fresh glass of iced tea before finishing the one I had.  Water was refilled during the meal.

The only reason I didn't give the fifth star was the mixup in the tasting menu.  The runner had taken the lead in contacting the restaurant about a tasting menu.  After some conversation, a list was sent and approved for our group.  However, two of the things we had chosen were not served and one of the appetizers we got, the scallops, was not ordered.  Additionally, we were headed from our lamb right into our dessert course skipping over the duck confit--one of the must items on our list.  When brought to the attention of our lead server, a manager came over in a short while and told us the chef was preparing our duck.

I know the restaurant has only been open a short time, but for a Daniel Boulud restaurant, when a menu has been submitted and agreed to, it should have been followed.  The serving staff was excellent.  The back of the house service needs some improvement.

This was a nice piece of salmon with some lump crabmeat and bay shrimp in a brie sauce.  It came with some lightly cooked thinly sliced carrots and some green beans.  The dish was very good.  My wife ordered the parmesan crusted chicken which came with lemon caper butter and linguini Alfredo.  This, too, was very good.

For dessert, we shared a molten lava chocolate cake with chocolate and caramel sauces.  It was topped with vanilla bean ice cream.  The dessert was fantastic!  It is similar to the other places that have some kind of molten chocolate dessert.  It seems to be one of the in desserts now.

Service was outstanding.  Our server, Dan, was around often but was not intrusive.  One of the managers also came around during the meal to see how things were.

Thanks to Ty W. and his excellent review, I was able to go from the Neonopolis garage directly to the Scullery for my first screening of the Las Vegas Film Festival.  

I think the room sign says 79 people capacity if I rememebr correctly.  For the film festival, they have plush sofas in the front reserved for film makers and other VIPs.  They then have several rows of standard metal chairs--not folding ones--for the audience.

There was some difficulty with the sound last night and the movie had to be restarted and they still tinkered with it after the movie was going.  Also, there were only a handful at this screening so we were told to move up.  The sofa seats are quite comfortable.  It's good the movie was good.  I could have been asleep easily with the comfort I enjoyed.

When you are seated, you can sample some of their sodas before placing your order.  Our sampler consisted of the root beer, vanilla, orange, and apple cider.  The apple cider was the best out of the samples- not too sweet, not too tart, just the right amount of carbonation.  The orange soda was mild, and was a bit like carbonated orange marmelade since I could taste a bit of orange peel in the flavor.  The vanilla was, well, vanilla, and the root beer was pretty mild tasting, not a lot of ""bite"".  I had the butterbeer, which was delicious.  It is more ""butter"" tasting rather than typical ""butterscotch"" flavor, which made it pretty unique.  

They also have sandwiches, and Cincinnati style chili.  The sandwiches are very good.  I tried the veggie sandwich which was filled with nicely roasted and marinated vegetables on fresh toasted bread.

Michael U had received notice from one of the employees at Twist that Chef Gagnaire would be in Las Vegas for a range of dates.  It was because of this we booked at this time.  The restaurant, on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in City Center, is elegant and the view is very good.

The three of us ended up getting a modified version of the grand tasting menu.  We were brought three rolls each and then the meal began.  First up was an amuse-blouche of two small bites with the server suggesting the correct order to eat the two. 

Course one was sea urchin mousseline with caviar.  There was gelée of bonito and grilled onion infusion and olive oil infused salsify spaghettini.  It was recommended that we mix the sea urchin with the spaghettini for the greatest flavor.  An excellent dish and an auspicious start for the evening. 

Course two was lobster fricassee with kaffir lime and enoki mushrooms, baby carrot stew and sweet wine and green tea butter and the dish was topped with some edible flowers.  The lobster was simply superb!

Course three was modified by us.  We added an extra course at an extra charge. It was carnaroli risotto with artichokes and pine nuts.  It was topped with some micro greens and a LOT of shaved truffles.  What a grand melding of flavors with the truffles and risotto and the pine nuts added a texture that made this dish another winner.

Next was time for a palate cleanser of some sorbet to ready us for the foie gras coming next.

Course four was the roasted foie gras with coffee and chestnut velouté, prunes and porcini.  More truffles were shaved on this dish and it was absolutely sublime.  The sauce was so rich and the mushrooms with the foie were the tops!

Course five was another divergence on our part.  We asked if we could sub proteins and we could.  Instead of the American Wagyu beef, I got Muscovy duck.  It ha d a green pepper sauce and caramelized pear and pine nuts.  The duck was accompanied by whisky jus eggplant cannelloni with duck confit.  Another winner, but I don't think I need to keep stating that.  A very good switch.

Course six was a series of desserts.  One of them we added à la carte--the mille-feuille with praline cream, cassis compote and blackberry sorbet.  We each took a third of this shared dessert but only one (me) slopped on the nice white linen.

The grand dessert course consists of three items: 1) Cassis: sorbet, wurtz, marmalade and cane sugar and pink pepper opaline; 2) Honey orange gelée, shortbread, mango and passion fruit topped with fromage blanc ice cream; 3) Chocolate gateau with golden raisins and Amarena cherries.   A suggestion was made in what order we should eat the desserts to get the fullest flavor profiles and it was a grand suggestion.  The dessert were rich, full of exceptional flavors, and very satisfying.  My favorite was the sorbet with grape halves that had been frozen and were around the sorbet.  A great concept.

Wait, we're not done yet.  Next we were brought a plate of three lemon meringue bites that had lemon filling between the two sections of meringue.  Each meringue bite was accompanied by three blueberries on an edible toothpick.

We're still not done--dessert six was brought for the three of us to share.  It was Gagnaire's Tanzanian chocolate parfait with coffee granité and caramelized hazelnuts.
This was rich, smooth, and a perfect chocolaty end to this grand tasting meal.

Service was outstanding as you would expect from Twist.  Chef Gagnaire came from the kitchen for a brief hello and the Chef de Cuisine, Ryuki Kawasaki, also came out and chatted with us for a short time and talked about his upcoming move to Bangkok, Thailand.

Before leaving, we each received a signed menu from both chefs with the date.  A keepsake for sure!  We also got a small package of two biscotti with the Twist logo to take with us.  Our jackets were waiting for us at the host's stand and we were helped on with them.

The premise of Bonnie's Old West Musical Revue is that you are going to be seeing an old time vaudeville show and that's exactly what the cast does.  It's  an hour and forty minutes--with a short intermission for B&B--of singing, dancing, and lots of jokes some of which are very corny, but they are funny when delivered by the cast.  They're jokes most of us have seen in emails, but it's a lot of fun to hear the laughter from people hearing them for the first time.  

One of my favorite parts of the show was the finale when the cast spoofed the Strip shows when they did a number about what you could have seen in Vegas if you hadn't come to Bonnie Springs.  Phantom, Cirque, Elvis impersonators--all were subject to being made fun of.  It was hilarious!

The stage is small but it's perfect for the show and for the room it's in.  There is an option for buying dinner before the show.  I had already eaten so I didn't opt for this.  There's a bar with a full complement of drinks.  

I have known one of the performers for a few years now and it was good to see her singing and dancing once again.  The piano player is absolutely fantastic.  The narrator has the perfect look for his role, and the rest of the cast do a fine job.

The show is scheduled to run every Saturday and Sunday through the end of August.  If business warrants, this may be extended and there are plans to have a holiday show later in the year.  

I definitely recommend this show.  However, it's better for older folks like me.  I'm not sure the 20 and 30 somethings would appreciate the cornball humor.  The kids sitting near me with their parents last night seemed to enjoy it too!",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The broth was indeed rich and flavorful and the noodles were very fresh with a chewy texture. The pork was well seasoned and went well with the ramen.

Service was good and I was checked up on as needed. Note that there is no soda fountain so soda is by the can or bottle (Coke products and Ramune).

We shared a peach tartlet, caramelized croissant, cinnamon roll croissant, and my husband had the shepherd's pie and chicken pot pie with garlic mashed potatoes. The desserts were all amazing. The peach was light, delicate, with the perfect amount of sweetness. The caramelized croissant is a dessert we all oohed and ahhhed over with each single bite. It had crispy, flaky, caramelized crust with a perfect soft textured interior. It was really a lovely balance of textures and sweetness. The cinnamon roll croissants were fresh from the oven. Oh my. If I had room in my stomach I'd eat a ton of them!

I didn't try any of the savory pies but my husband enjoyed them. The garlic mashed potato side he had with them was infused with garlic flavor, with creamy skin-on freshly mashed potatoes. Delicious.

The owner is incredibly friendly and sweet and it's no surprise that in such a short amount of time his business has grown from selling out of a small food truck to a brick and mortar location. The prices are so reasonable too it's really hard to not like anything about this place.

The donuts were soft, and fresh, with a light amount of glaze on them. I had some chocolate covered long donuts and a maple glazed and they were all great.

We were seated promptly and our server came by to take our drink orders. That's the extent of our good experience here. From then on things went downhill. Our coffee cups came with cream but it took a long time for someone to get sugar packets to us. I looked at my coffee cup. The rim was filthy with what looked like dirt as I could rub a powdery brown substance off of it. I requested another coffee cup which came out with brown stains still on the cup.

I opted for the standard breakfast, with carne adovada. Unfortunately we were told that they ran out of carne adovada (AKA they did not prep any yesterday to cook for today). So, I opted for the chorizo instead. The breakfast came with 2 eggs, which I ordered poached. After a few minutes our server came by to say the kitchen has no way to make poached eggs right now. Really? I refuse to believe that they do not have a pot and water to boil in their kitchen. 

The breakfast, when it finally arrived, was OK, nothing special. The chorizo overall had good flavor but parts of it were looking overcooked and black. I do appreciate that they added 2 extra pieces of bacon to the meal to make up for the lack of carne adovada and poached eggs.

WsIJixo-2iDc-V078c_afQ,2,2013-04-16,0,sAvJjtxXwiaalD9XvehoOA,3,"One of the benefits of living in Las Vegas is the large amount of talent and opportunity to see shows.  Raack N Roll is a newer topless revue that moved from Hooters to the D.  

The show is opened by Robert Nash, a look and sound alike for Robert De Niro.   He provides some comedy relief, and quiet, throughout the show.  He's quite good at what he does.  As with all impersonators, he's much better with some than others.  Of course he does De Niro well.  His Marlon Brando is a little off but funny nonetheless.

Now to the reason why I came to the show.  This is a topless revue and it's well done.  The ladies are quite attractive and their dancing is pretty good.  The big problem with the show is the venue.  The D has spent a lot of money renovating the property since they purchased it.  The showroom has a new entrance, but the room itself remains pretty much unchanged.  That means there's a low stage, perhaps 2 feet raised from the floor.  When the ladies are doing some moves that have them low on the stage, it's difficult to see what they're doing.  If you really want to see them without anyone in your way, get there early and hope for front seats.

The music is loud--too loud, I think--basically hard rock.  Of course, I'm not the demographic to which they're appealing. The younger folks in the audience last night seemed to be moving with the beat.

A couple of my favorite scenes--the woman on the swing to ""Feelin' Good"", the mini-bondage scene, and of course the classroom scene where an audience member--male--gets to join in the ""fun"" at school.

I had a reservation for opening at 5:30.  I wanted to have a slow meal with time left over to get from the Bellagio to a show at the Venetian at 9 PM.  I was seated promptly.  I was immediately given menus and asked if I had a show or other time constraint.  Explaining my need to be at the Venetian by 8:30 to get my tickets, my server and I agreed I had lots of time for an unhurried meal.  (I should note for one of my Yelp friends--I was offered a darker napkin option from white as I was wearing dark pants.  I kept the white.)

They had four options.  There were two dégustation menus--a regular one and a black truffle one.  They also have three course pre-theatre dinners and à la carte selections.  I ordered and iced tea which was quickly brought.  I looked at the truffle menu, but I had already decided on the regular dégustation from looking at their online menu.  There were some changes to the menu.  I ordered and the delightful dining began.

Bread service consisted of several kinds of rolls.  I chose an onion and bacon roll.  I really appreciated the butter.  It was in two sections--one unsalted and one salted.  I am not a fan of unsalted butter.  The butter was shaped in the Le Cirque logo and was thin in depth so it became soft quickly which is another plus for me.  I hate fighting with near-frozen unsalted butter.

An amuse-blouche of a soup with a quail egg on top started the evening.  There were a couple of pieces of Iberico ham referred to as bacon truffle in the liquid.  It was very good.  There was a thin toast round on top of the glass and it was suggested I take the spoon and pierce though to the egg and goodness below.  I wish I had noted the soup on which the quail sat but I was more intent on getting a photo and then eating.

Course one was New Zealand langoustine topped with some osetra caviar and edible gold leaf.  The plate was adorned with some tapioca, passion fruit, and apple and vodka gelée.  I liked the langoustine, but the adornments were more for that than for a taste point of view.  It was beautiful plating and pleasing to the eye.  

Course two was Santa Barbara Sea Urchin Royale with king crab and a lemon grass emulsion.  It was served in a white cup that would remind you of a sea animal.  Great plating idea and very tasty.  The sea urchin and crab were superb!

Course three was wild Atlantic turbot with roasted sunchokes, chanterelles, a celeriac purée, artichoke chips, and Barigoule sauce.  The fish was very good.

Course four was different from what I had planned.  The online menu has not been updated.  I was going to get their venison, but the menu had rotated and they hadn't changed the online version yet.  Instead, I got duck with a port wine reduction with a potato puff.  The duck was so moist and tasty and the duck jus was excellent!  The potato puff was so good I wanted to get another.  It was like you puffed a french fry after removing the potato from inside its out wrapping.  The reduction had solidified on the plate and was one point where I wondered why it was done.  A little nit pick.  Maybe it was a plating reason.

At this point, you have a choice of cheese or pre-dessert.  When I found out the pre-dessert was sorbet, I ordered the cheese.  It was a cows milk cheese from Switzerland served with some candied walnuts and two raisin bread rounds.  The cheese was delicately sculptured and the cheese course was very good.  The cheese was just a tiny bit on the way to sharp.

There were several desserts for the finishing touches.  I had ordered coconut soufflé.  They also had chocolate and Grand Marnier soufflés but he had me as soon as he said coconut.  With the soufflé was a spoon of mango sorbet and a container of chopped mango and pineapple.  The spoon of sorbet was kept in place on the plate with some brown sugar so when you picked up the spoon to have some sorbet, you also got some sugar sweetness.  Very clever and tasty!  Accompanying the soufflé, as if this wasn't enough dessert, were four mignardises--a lemon merengue tart, a raspberry tart, a caramel puff, and a dark, unsweetened chocolate goodness.  I felt guilty eating all these sweet things--well 2 seconds of guilt, that's all!

Service was impeccable except for my other nit pick.  As soon as you finished a course, a young man was there almost immediately to remove the plate so you didn't sit with a dirty dish.  The one time, he was almost too quick to remove the plate.  I was still eating a piece of bread when he removed the plate.  It wasn't to hurry me.  It was simply so you had a clean table in front of you.   He brought me a new glass of iced tea when my first one was almost empty.

I've tried a myriad of dishes here, both Taiwanese and more generally Chinese-  oyster omelet, stir fried napa cabbage with dried shrimp, a fish entree with some chili sauce, Taiwan style rice noodles, Taiwanese sesame oil chicken, and some Hainanese chicken rice.  My favorites out of all these dishes were the Taiwanese rice noodles and the Hainanese chicken rice.  The rice noodles were full of flavor and were reminiscent of the rice noodles my mom used to make when I was a kid.  The Hainan style chicken rice had a nice ginger-sesame oil paste to go with the steamed chicken and rice.  The Taiwanese sesame oil chicken was a stewy concoction of slowly simmered dark meat chicken in a flavorful ginger-sesame broth.  I loved the broth, but you have to be hardcore Asian to eat the chicken, since it is roughly chopped with a cleaver and you will have to really work at getting all the meat from the chicken pieces, as well as picking out bits of bone while eating the meat.  

We also had some bubble tea- taro and pineapple coconut.  The drinks here are more frothy and light as opposed to the more heavier and dense drinks you might find at other bubble tea shops.  I like how they have a good selection of jellies to put in your drink if you aren't tapioca inclined.

When we went to be seated, they suggested we sit in the bar area as they had two large parties in the main dining room- one with 70 people and one with 20.  We were told that it would be difficult to take our orders and get served in the dining room.  We decided to sit in the bar area.

We didn't know it at the time, but our orders went to the kitchen right after the orders for the 70 something party.  Little did we know it would be a long wait.  

After about 20 minutes, pour waitress came by and apologized for the delay and said the food would be coming soon.  She offered us chips and salsa to munch on until the food came.  We declined.

Ten minutes later, she stopped by again and asked if the manager had been by.  She said the manager would be bringing our meals presently and again she apologized.  WIthin a few minutes, the manager did bring our meals and apologized offering to give us two desserts or a discount on the check.  We declined dessert and when she brought the check, she had deducted the cost of the one meal.  That was great customer service and was certainly a way to bring us back.  The thing I wish, however, is that they would be honest up front.  Had I known the wait would have been that long, I would have gone elsewhere.  Had I known -  had they told me.

As for the food, I had chicken fajitas and my wife had their Chicken Monterrey.  Both dishes were normal Chili's dishes and everything tasted great.  It's a shame the dinner was diminished by the service issues, but I can understand the problem of dealing with that many people in one large party.

I had looked at the menu online and I knew what I'd order before I got there.  It sounds like I had truffle mania but actually there was little truffle taste in anything that had the name truffle attached to it.

I ordered the Sunny Side burger which is also known as the truffle especiale.  The menu describes it having parmesan frico, fried egg, truffle butter,and truffled arugula.  Along with this, I ordered the truffle fries described as thin cut fries with truffle cheese.

I ordered my burger rare and that's just the way it was served.  That was great!  The burger was large.  I didn't eat the top bun with its U brand for the company.  The burger was good.  I ate it with knife and fork rather than the pick up and slop over yourslef.  The fries were OK.  They were limp which I gather is the way Umami always serves them.  They were like an 80 year old who hadn't taken his Viagra.  I also had a black iced tea--known as gun powder tea--that was refilled without needing to ask.

My server was Courtney and she was TERRIFIC!  She was pleasant, knowledgable, and good at her job!

Entrance to the canyon is from Canyon Road in Boulder City.  As you go up the road, there are two traffic circles.  The second one has a metal mountain bike sculpture and the 35 mile River Mountain Trail passes one of the circles.

There are bathrooms at the small park and this is a trailhead for some of the trails in this section of the canyon.  The historical marker in my photos tells how the canyon got its name.

The sound and lighting in the Joint are exceptional.  Needless to say, KISS had a lot of pyro effects and the lighting was great.  It would be nice if they could have raised the catwalk.  It was in the way for some of the stage viewing.

I chose the Caesar salad, upgraded to the French onion soup ($1 more), had the 6 oz. top sirloin with raspberry cheesecake as dessert. 

In general, everything was good. The salad was cool and refreshing, the soup had beefy onion flavor, and the sirloin was cooked nicely at medium rare.

Would this be my lucky day for ramen?  I was excited to try out this place since I saw the signs go up in this shopping center. We got here on a Friday night and were quoted a 30 minute wait but actually got seated in maybe 10-15 minutes. Seating is a bit limited as the shop itself is small. 

The namesake ""hachi"" or 8 refers to the number of ingredients in a bowl of their ramen. There are currently 4 different types to choose from: Shoyu, tonkatsu, miso, and the hachi special which comes with more chashu pork and egg. Note that getting the miso ramen or combination is an extra dollar versus getting the shoyu or tonkatsu. After browsing through their menu I decided on the miso ramen karaage combination and tried some of the tonkatsu ramen. The combination includes a side of karaage chicken, rice bowl, and a small bowl of bean sprouts in addition to the ramen of your choice. 

When I got my ramen I was disappointed that there weren't any slices of pork in it, despite paying an extra dollar. On the menu too it states that the ramen bowls come with your basic toppings: 1 piece chashu, 1/2 flavored egg, black mushroom (Or corn, bean sprouts), 1 piece dry seaweed, and green onion so I was expecting some kind of meat at least in the bowl. I thought at first a brown clump spotted on my ramen was maybe ground meat but it turned out to be miso paste. The flavor of the broth itself was very light, and the bowl had the thicker, yellow crinkled kind of noodles. Quite honestly I didn't really enjoy the flavor that much and the only thing I liked about the bowl was the lovely 1/2 egg which was marinated in soy sauce with a deep gold colored soft yolk. The tonkatsu ramen I tried did have the piece of chashu pork in it which was flavorful and tender, and it came with the thinner, straight, more pale noodles that look similar to what they serve at Tampopo Ramen. 

The karaage chicken was lightly battered, very juicy and tender. 

If I came here again I wouldn't get the miso ramen again due to the higher cost for value but maybe another variety of ramen from here will be better!",24,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We got an order of bacon guacamole for an appetizer and it came with four wedges of seasoned chips.  The guacamole was excellent.  The cotija cheese gave the guacamole a super flavor in addition to the bacon.  The chips tasted a bit stale and didn't have the crispness of their taco chips.  We were brought the complimentary chips and 3 salsas and all three were good but the inferna was the best flavor, yet it wasn't that spicy.

For our mains, I got one of the lunch specials--turkey mole enchiladas.  The enchiladas were spread inside with a thin layer of very good masa.  The enchiladas were covered with an almond mole that was complex in flavor and very good.  The enchiladas were filled with well seasoned turkey meat and there was a small frisée salad on top with some very thin fresh peach slices.   My wife got the carnitas tacos.  There were three soft tacos with two kinds of rice and some black beans with cotija cheese.  I ate one of the tacos and the pork and toppings were very good.  The chipotle salsa was very good.

We waited for awhile and then ordered two half desserts.  They allow you two pick two desserts and get a half portion of each.  We got the pastel Rufina.  The menu describes it this way:  layers of puff pastry, sweetened cream cheese, chocolate chunks, and fresh berries.  The berries were raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries and the dessert is made with eclair-like puff pastry and topped with the cream cheese and chocolate chunks.  It was superb!  The other selection was a small wedge of their flourless chocolate truffle cake. The menu describes it as rich, delicate chocolate truffle cake with prickly pear lychee sauce and raspberries.  The chocolate is very rich in flavor but it is not delicate.  It was very dense although very tasty.

Service was good although we waited for a time to get an iced tea refill.  I really like Border Grill and I'll be back.",14,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The shrimp were huge, and served in the shell, head on. Peeling them was no problem though. The snow crab were a little harder to crack open (Obviously), and the meat inside was a little bland and needed that extra kick from the sauce to make it tasty.

The sauce was a good mixture of salty, spicy, lemony heat, especially with the shrimp. The corn on the cob came in the bag and was really tasty since it was marinating in the seafood juices and sauce. The sweet potato fries were good as well and a nice side with the rest of the meal.

I looked over the menu and I also asked her suggestion.  She pointed to an oxtail stew that's not on their online menu.  I opted to take her advice.  

I started with their papas rellenas--mashed potatoes stuffed with picadillo beef and deep fried.  Presentation was very nice with two very thin plantain pieces deep freid and stuck in the papas.  There was also a small salad.

The menu said all dinners come with red or black beans and rice.  I specified black beans.  That was the first language mixup.  Not only did I get black beans with my meal but my server brought me an extra bowl of black beans because she thought I ordered an extra dish.  It was good so I ate both!

The oxtail stew was very flavorful.  I think some people might have thought the broth was salty, but it was just great for me.

Dessert order time.  I asked about the size of the tres leches cake tower with flan and coconut.  She assured me it wasn't that large and then she brought me the normal flan and not the tres leches cake.  Language problem number 2.

She asked if I wanted more Coke and I said, ""No, iced tea.""  She then brought me a Coke.  I didn't notice, but I soon had a table side science experiment.  You have no idea how Coke foams when you put artificial sweetener in it.  I managed to keep little Vesuvius from flooding the table, but I didn't drink the Coke.  Last language error.

I got a salmon roll (They offer spicy, smoked, and regular raw versions here) with asparagus, green onion, and avocado.  It was a huge portion, and I was definitely full after just 1 roll.  I upgraded by getting a combo, and the miso soup was light, and not too salty.  The quality of the roll itself: decent.  The rice was a little mushy, but the veggies and salmon tasted OK.  My friend had the 3 alarm roll, and it looked out of this world good!  It was topped with so much sauce and spicy ingredients that she could only finish about half of it.

While waiting for Chris  to arrive, we got coffee and water and we started looking over the menu.  As Chris said in his review, we deferred to Michael for the ordering.  We ordered 6 items--two in each of three courses.  First up were biscuits without the gravy and an order of high roller tater tots.  These two were winners.  The biscuits very buttery and flaky and the tots really good with the kalbi.  The scallion in the tots was a great addition and added a counterpoint to the kalbi's sweet flavor. 

Course two consisted of more carbs--stuffed strawberry French toast and a stack of blueberry pancakes.  The French toast was good.  There was strawberry syrup but I expected it would be stuffed with strawberries which were not there.  The blueberry pancakes were excellent.  I used a bit of butter and a small amount of syrup.  The fresh blueberries made this the second course winner.

We ended with an order of fried cookie dough bites and pumpkin bread pudding.  Hands down, the bread pudding was the winner of this course.  I thought the cookie dough bites were a little sweet and the bacon didn't cut the sweetness.  

The owners are very pleasant people.  We were present as Carolyn made Chef Robert repeat himself--twice--saying, ""You were right"" to his wife.  My how she enjoyed hearing those words a few times.

While waiting at an office yesterday morning, I did a Yelp search and found The Crêpe was on the way home.  After the appointment, off I was to Tivoli Place for breakfast.

There was a sign to seat yourself and I went a few tables in from the open door.  It was a perfect place because you could enjoy the morning air but the breeze coming in wasn't overwhelming.

I was brought a menu by Agnes.  I later found out she was the owner.  After looking over the selection of breakfast crêpes, I went with the special of the day which was a crêpe with pastrami, scrambled eggs, potatoes, and Russian mustard.

The crêpe was very tasty.  The mustard absolutely made the dish, however.  It was a rich, spicy, brown mustard with a lot of favor.

As I was waiting for the crêpe to be made, Agnes came by and as we starting chatting, she sat down across the table from me and she explained that the restaurant had only been opened for two months.  We also talked about the music and dance evenings they have.  I think I need to go back for one of the jazz nights and have a dessert crêpe.

The crêpe was tasty and it was artfully presented.  As I said before, the mustard made the dish!  I will come back again.  I like the space and the ambiance.  The crêpes are a bit pricey, but then the rents for Tivoli have to be high, too!  A coffee Americano is $3 with a $1.50 charge for a refill.

The title of the program was ""Roasting Las Vegas: The Critics can DISH it out, but can they take it?""  As it turns out, they can and it was a lot of fun!

When I arrived at Three Square, my first time there, I was taken back by the huge size of the buildings where canned food is stored for distribution, other food is prepared for delivery to kitchens for serving those in need, and all the other space needed for helping to feed the hungry in Las Vegas.  The numbers are staggering but the one that hit me the most was that they serve one in four children in Las Vegas.  That's a staggering number of kids who depend on Three Square to augment or provide their food needs.

The three reviewers being roasted were Max Jacobson, Al Mancini, and John Curtas. Their reviews appear in the local free papers and they are known to the foodie community in Las Vegas.  This was a chance for the chefs to fight back, so to speak, and roast these critics for what they've said in their past reviews.  Chefs there to roast were Todd Harrington (executive chef of Central by Michel Richard in Caesars), Stephen Hopcraft (executive chef of STK in the Cosmopolitan and former Top Chef contestant), Gary LaMorte (corporate chef for the Michael Mina Group), Vic Vegas (executive chef of Vic's Restaurant in Henderson and former Next Food Network Star contestant), Carla Pellegrino (executive chef of Bratalian Neapolitan Cantina in Town Square and former Top Chef contestant), and Beni Valasquez (exceutive chef at the Bar + Bistro in the Arts District). Also roasting was Theresa Woo of the family that owns Fu in the Hard Rock Hotel).

It was a fun evening with a lot of laughs, some good food, and good beer and wine or so my table mates told me.  I managed to get a table near the front and next to the three tables where the chefs and their friends sat.  What a great way to help Three Square and get to see and hear the chefs we know and the critics we read.

The interior is basic, but nice, with sunny yellow colors and a TV playing in the corner (They were playing Shaolin Soccer when we were here).

We started with the Taiwanese sausage. It was excellent, with tender pork, a slightly sweet flavor with a hint of spice. It's some of the best Chinese/Taiwanese style sausage I've had in years. It was served with some sliced pieces of raw garlic that accented the sausage well when eaten together.

We shared the three-cup chicken and the Taiwanese rice noodle/vermicelli for our entrees. The three-cup chicken was delicious. It had chunks of dark meat, bone-in chicken marinated in a deep, robust sweetened soy-sauce broth. The vermicelli was perfect. The delicate rice noodles had a hint of smokiness, and a generous serving of soy-sauce marinated meat was piled on top. The vermicelli tasted very similar to how my mom used to make it at home. Ah the memories!

Service was good, and the owner would stop by to check in on us. Our main waitress spoke both English and Chinese (Mandarin), but another person bringing out our food seemed to know only Mandarin.

Aside from your cans of American sodas, they have sodas you would find commonly in Taiwan, like Apple Sidra and Hey-Song sasparilla. They also serve up fresh fruit smoothies, which I would love to try one of these days.

The order taker went back and checked the cookie boxes and came back and told me what WAS available.  I went with the white chocolate chip cookie.  I got this with cookies and cream ice cream which I knew they had because I had seen it.

There was a bit of a wait because the boba orders were ahead of me and they were somewhat busy.  In due time, a gentleman came back and opened a new box of white chocolate chip cookies and removed two.  He then used a two-piece plastic gadget to make the ice cream sandwich.  First, he put a piece of plastic on top of one of the cookies and pressed really hard.  This plastic had a raised portion and it was in here that he scooped the ice cream.  Then the second cookie was placed on top and another piece of plastic was used to push very hard on the cookie to press the ice cream into the perfect sandwich shape it is.

The ice cream sandwich was placed in a paper holder and given to me.  The cookies must be specially made for this purpose because they were as hard as rocks.  They would have to be to survive the pressure placed on them by the person making the sandwich.  Optional dental coverage should be available!

The dishes, when brought out, look so nice you almost feel bad eating it (Well, almost).   In almost every dish, there is a blending of East meets West which makes each meal unique.

For example, our amuse-bouche was an avant-garde interpretation of pepperoni pizza.  In a shot glass, you have a basil-tomato type puree with basil foam on top, and a singular slice of Chinese sausage (or Chinese pepperoni, as they call it).  For the ""crust,"" a thin cracker stick is laid on top of the glass.  I was apprehensive because I've never really tried to imbibe my pizza before, but it actually had a quite pleasing taste that did remind me of a pepperoni pizza.  

The Pepsi shrimp appetizers were delicious, and I tried some of the sesame chicken and had the chicken trio.  The sesame chicken, as stated by my husband, is the best sesame chicken he's every had.  Tender chicken, crisp batter, and a delicious sauce.  I appreciated the idea of the chicken trio, and it was beautifully presented, but for me I probably won't be ordering this again.  Compared to the other two types of chicken in this dish- a 5-spice marinated drumstick and pesto-topped chicken breast, the stuffing and chicken in the ""chicken cheesecake"" seemed mismatched due to its heavy taste.

Dessert was superb.  The 14-layer chocolate cake was very light and not overly sweet.

In general, this is a great place to have a nice dinner. The entrees are very reasonably priced for the quality of food that you get, and the atmosphere makes you forget that you are actually in a restaurant that is part of a mall.

For lunch, the 10 of us shared these Shanghai style dim sum selections: soup dumplings (XLB),  crab and pork soup dumplings, pan fried pork buns, beef fried buns, pot stickers, spicy won ton, rice cake stir fry with pork and cabbage, Shanghai fried thin noodles, red bean pan cake, and eight treasure rice pudding.

All of us liked the food very much.  I found the XLB to be a bit bland.  My favorite was the Shanghai fried noodles.  I'd go back just for that.

Service was excellent.  Shirley spoke with the staff for the most part, but the hostess and one of the servers had great English so we'd be OK if we went without Shirley.

The restaurant is very nicely appointed.  It's not very large but can hold several large parties like ours at their large round tables.  The parking lot is very, very small!

I have to come back and try this for a regular dinner, not just dim sum, to get a better feel for the dishes.  But, this was a very good lunch!

Edit:  My photos don't do justice to most of the dishes.  I was sitting in the wrong section of the circle and those from our group started digging into the dishes before I could get a photo of the entire dish.  Plating was very nicely done!",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I got two fritters--an apple and a blueberry--and one croissant doughnut, a.k.a., cronut, that was raspberry filled.  The fritters were both quite good and while one was bought for my wife, she only got a small taste of it.  I had it gone in a flash.

She didn't care for the raspberry cronut thinking it was too sweet.  I soon dispatched the rest of that so she didn't have to suffer.

We realistically weren't expecting to see any of the guys on the show, but we were excited to see some of the items that were shown on TV.

We got here around opening time on a Sunday morning (Around 9 A.M.). There was no line, and there was no problem finding parking during that time. 

The store is comprised of two different sections. The front half is reserved for their pawn shop items for sale, mainly jewelry and accessories with a smattering of antique and unique items that you might have seen on the show. The back half holds the large items (e.g., cars, bikes), various works of art (Including sad clown paintings selling for thousands of dollars), and souvenir stuff from the show. We browsed through several times, but found that:

1. The jewelry and accessories were priced pretty high.

2. While there were a few items I recognized from the show, I was disappointed that they didn't have the ""Death Clock"" on the shelves (i.e., the ormolu clock).

3. I really wanted to buy a souvenir, but I didn't see any shirts that I wanted to buy, and I didn't want to pay $7 for a Pawn Stars bandana or lanyard. Other items I saw for sale were hats, glassware, keychains, decorative plates, pens, posters, and a fuzzy Chumlee blanket.

If you're a fan of the show, it's worth a stop to see the pawn shop. They do post what people from the show will be at the shop that day (When we went, Rebecca the historical books expert was going to be there in the afternoon).",11,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

ncsg2Dj8q8oqQPkGAMTM8Q,3,2010-12-19,0,8FPZn8p199EgWiWT_OJweg,4,"This is a moderate, 3 mile round trip hike in the Conservation Area.  You get to the trailhead by driving the Scenic Drive about halfway.  Between Mile 7 and 8 on the drive, there's a side road that turns off to the right.  There is a sign saying Willow Springs Picnic Area and Lost Creek Children's Discovery Trail a couple of hundred feet before the road.  Turn right onto this road and go to the end where the fencing is at the picnic area.

From here, start hiking west on a dirt road that goes by an Indian roasting pit, down into a wash, and back up.  On the other side of the wash, Rocky Gap Road (a 4x4 road that's very bad) goes off to your left.  For La Madre Springs, turn right and follow the signs to the Springs.

The trail is a busy one at Red Rock so you most likely won't be hiking alone.  There is an elevation gain, and you may need to stop and catch your breath.  Also, the trail is not smooth.  For a fair amount of the trail, you're walking on some good size gravel and rocks, so take care as you hike along.

After a while, you'll come to a side trail, the White Rock Loop Trail, that goes off to your right.  DON'T take this trail.  That's for another day.  Keep going straight ahead.  You'll come to some concrete pads. This was once used by an archery club.

Eventually you come to a small concrete dam that is La Madre Springs.  The dam was built by an owner of the property years ago to store water for animals.  This is technically the end of the hike.  To make it more interesting, you can walk along the creek that runs into the dam and follow a well used trail that leads to some small waterfalls.

The trail continues beyond here into the mountains, but I don't recommend this unless you're with someone who has done this trail.  It can be a bit muddy in a couple of places, you have to cross the creek a couple of times, and the footing gets poor.

It's best to explore just past the dam and then re-trace your steps to the parking area.  If you bring a cooler, the Willow Springs Picnic Area is a great place to have a sandwich and drink before driving back to Las Vegas.

M5dqqrla2JsBn5G3pV3Dmg,6,2014-06-24,2,852blALy90_CQc58tyOvKw,4,"I've hiked the Bonanza Trail twice and don't plan to do it again.  It's a strenuous hike of about 10 miles round trip to the summit and back.  To get to the trailhead, you have to drive US 95 north past the two roads that lead to Kyle and lee Canyons at Mount Charleston.  You turn left where the sign says Cold Creek.  The road goes between the two prisons along US 95.  Drive west about 10 miles to the village of Cold Creek.  The last section of the road is rough and it's best to have a high clearance vehicle.

There is a parking area at the trailhead and a group camping area.  From here, you go cross a meadow for about a half a mile to get to the first of many, many switchbacks.  One website says there are 80 switchbacks.  The elevation gain makes the hiking tough.

Part way up the switchbacks, you'll come to an old burn area and you can see how the forest has tried to recover.  None of the large trees are growing much and it will take a long time.

After what seems an interminable hike, you reach the saddle.  From the saddle, the trail heads south in the direction of Mount Charleston.  The Bristlecone Trail in Lee Canyon is only 8 miles down the trail.  As you start toward the limestone peak to the left of the trail, there is a small use trail that goes to the peak.  If you get to the cairn in one of my photos, you've gone a little too far but you can get to the summit from there.  From the saddle, as the trail heads south, find a spot where you can head to the left and get on top of the limestone cliffs.  If you go left too soon, you'll have a climb up the cliffs.  If you stay more to the right, you'll be able to get to the summit without any climbing.  I used my GPS unit to find the summit.

Once at the summit, it's time for a well deserved rest and a chance to enjoy the view.  Find the ammo box and sign the register.  There is cell phone coverage for almost the entire hike so doing it alone is not a problem.

After your rest, retrace your steps.  This is a different trail for another reason.  It's one of the few trails I hike in the Spring Mountains that you can see the parking lot for a good part of the hike.  That's interesting but not essential information.  

I would not recommend this hike on a windy day.  The  winds at the summit can be fierce and you'll be fighting your way up the mountain.  If you do this hike, take plenty of water, wear good hiking boots, and a GPS unit for finding the summit is always a good idea.

When we walked in we were immediately greeted by the host and chef Eddie was there too. My friend is a fan of his and talked to him for a little bit and he introduced himself to us too and wished us a great night at the restaurant.

The interior is lush, warm, and a bit eclectic, with large stuffed trophy fish on the walls, a large fish pillow on the side couch, and kokopelli figurines decorating the shelves. Our table was large with comfortable seating. 

We browsed through the menu. Feeling in a red meat type of mood, I decided on the restaurant week special with steak tartare, lamb with fattoush and hummus, and lava dessert ($33). I also tried some bacon infused meatloaf, brown butter shrimp, and pumpkin cheesecake. 

The steak tartare was excellent. The flavor it was infused with actually made me think I was eating tuna instead of steak. The crisp cucumber it was perched on made a nice contrast to the soft texture of the meat.

The lamb was decent, and the hummus was good (Although more pita triangles to go with the amount of hummus I had would've been nice). The fattoush salad tasted like it had been sitting in the dressing for slightly too long. 

Unfortunately, the whole shrimp I tried wasn't cleaned well as I could taste a lot of grit when I chewed, distracting from the rest of the dish.

The bacon infused meatloaf was the real star of the show. It was heavenly. Moist, with a perfect mix of spices, with smoky bacon flavor in each bite. I will definitely be ordering this next time!

The pumpkin cheesecake was packed with pumpkin spice flavor, with a light whipped texture. the pepita brittle was delicious. The lava dessert was actually touted as a ""warm Boston 'LAVA' banana chocolate cream pie"" but it looked like a chocolate lava cake with sliced bananas on the bottom. I didn't really see anything pie-like about it? I also didn't taste or see much Boston cream pie in it. There also wasn't any lava center in the dessert. The chocolate flavor was good though.

Service was impeccable. Our server was warm, humorous, and very attentive to our table. 

Overall I'll definitely come here again for the warm friendly service, the lovely atmosphere, and that lovely bacon infused meatloaf!",5,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

They have an all you can eat fish fry that also comes with the requisite chips/fries.  After ordering the Scotch egg appetizer, I decided to go with the fish fry special. 

The Scotch egg was decent, and came with a mixed green salad with strawberries, which I thought was a bit odd since the heartiness of the Scotch egg didn't really go with the delicate taste of the salad and strawberries.  The fish fry was pretty good, albeit greasy.  The batter was light, and the fish was flaky and moist.  The chips were unevenly cooked and seasoned, as some chips were very salty, while others were very bland.  Also, some chips tasted slightly undercooked and mushy, while others tasted OK.  My friend also ordered the fish fry, and after he had eaten the first 2 pieces of fish that were served, he asked for some more.  It took a very long time to get the 2nd order of fish in, and once it did come in it was just a single piece of fish, swimming with grease.

OdeDt-ceeNTu7LSTUqqBbA,10,2014-04-08,12,3c3Yjvv_x_JQiPdGLgPFIA,2,"I wonder what Don Arden and Fluff LeCoque would think of the new, relaunched Jubilee! After being closed for several weeks, it had its official relaunch at the end of March.  I saw the show last night, my 7th time seeing the show, and I am aghast at what has been done.

I never thought I would go to see Jubilee! and I have a man acting as a master of ceremonies for this section of the show ask, ""How you doin', Vegas?  I said, How you doin' Vegas?  Get out of your seats and clap with me.""  At this point, most of us stood and clapped while some singers did a number and then we all sat back down.

The show now is a mishmash.  It doesn't know what it wants to be.  It starts out somewhat like the old Jubilee! with pretty showgirls parading in wonderful showgirl costumes.  After this, the train starts to jump the track.  We have music that tries to appeal to Boomers and near Millennials.  

Along the way, the curtain comes down and a showgirl is ""lost"" outside the curtain from her friends.  Thus begins Jubilee's attempt to return to the friends.  (Yep, the lost character is called Jubilee).  We see her later stage right as some sing about the lost Jubilee but then it ends.  We don't see her anymore as a lost person.  During part of her journey, she's guided by dancers carrying light sticks.  I think I had to push by jaw back in place when I saw that!

The classic Samson and Delilah and Titanic numbers remain in the show with some costume modifications and some scenery changes but they are about the same as they have been.  

One of the new parts that really was appealing was a tap dance number with just the showgirls' legs showing from the knees down. It was quite well done and lasted all of about 30 seconds.

The lighting has been changed so it often shines at the audience.  The show used to have two or three short segments between the big numbers where contract acts did specialty things.  The last time I was here, there was a person who did some work with silks.  This bit of diversion gave the dancers time to change and the tech crew time to get the scenery changes in place.  These specialty segments are now gone.

There are some good projections but seriously do you have to make it seem like  Caesars Entertainment is the only thing on the Strip.  I know Bally's is a CET property but come on, showing The Cromwell, the High Roller, Caesars Palace et. al. in some of the projection is amazing!  We know where we are.  We're on the Las Vegas Strip seeing what was a classic Las Vegas topless showgirl review that has been relaunched.  Keeping the Titanic in the show is quite correct.  The Jubilee! ship is sinking.  Time to play Nearer My God To Thee for Jubilee! 

Edit: I have to add that the final scene is as marvelous as ever.  A grand staircase with lovely showgirls coming down in their heels and wonderful costumes. The ending is classic!  

It saddens me to see what they've done to this show.  Judging by attendance last night, it's not working and that's a shame!",17,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
ljMmNkWxqoxS37_h6JTS2g,9,2012-06-07,1,IQhv8fcrSJwTotFrl89ByA,5,"Fletcher Canyon is an easy/moderate hike at Mount Charleston that is great to do in late spring when the snow is melting and coming down the canyon.  This hike is about 4 miles round trip with only about 600 foot elevation gain.

The trailhead is along SR 157, Kyle Canyon Road, about 5 miles before the end of the road at the lodge.  There is adequate parking on the south side of the road, but this fills up fast on Saturday and Sunday, so if you're going to try this hike, get there early.  

The trail at the beginning is wide but it turns west into the canyon and it narrows.  This is a pinyon and ponderosa pine area.  After a short walk, you drop into the creek bed (this part is generally dry) and you continue up the canyon.  The trail crosses the stream several times.  If you hike this when there is water coming down from melting snow, you may have to walk in a higher area or just plan to get your boots wet. There's is a spring, and there's usually some water flowing here, but it's not enough to be a bother.

After a mile and a quarter, the canyon narrows as you approach the end of the trail.  Some of the side walls are 200 feet tall and it's often very cool in this area.

You eventually get to Obstacle Rock.  This is the place to do a bit of exploring and to have a snack before hiking back.  There's a way to get beyond this giant boulder, but it's a lot easier coming down from above than trying to climb up the slippery rock.  

Retrace your steps to the car. This is a hike you'll want to do more than once.  It's quite interesting to do this when there's snow on the trail.",14,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The potatoes were a bit mealy tasting though and I would have liked an extra texture such as the addition of onion or pico de gallo to contrast with all the soft textures of the burro. The carnitas was decent, filled with slow cooked pork. The pork was moist as if it were cooked in a pot rather than roasted or fried like how I've encountered other carnitas in other restaurants.

I've been in the plaza several times when I was picking up Thai food nearby, but I never never stopped here.  Sunday, they open a 8 and I was there at 8:10.  A little warmer and I could have eaten outside, but it is December!

Misty was my server and she was a gem!  Very pleasant smile, lots of helpful information, lots of coffee refills.  

I ordered the Red Rock Bene which the menu describes as layers of Focaccia bread, bacon, fresh spinach, poached eggs, and homemade Hollandaise.  It's not ""layers"" of Focaccia.  Rather, there are two very large cuts of Focaccia each about two and a half to three inches tall.  I'm guessing those are the cliffs at Red Rock.  The rest was the standard Benedict except for the bacon.  The breakfast comes with choice of home fries or breakfast potatoes and if you get breakfast potatoes, you can get them plain or with fried onion and peppers.  There's a small charge for the onions and peppers, something I didn't see on the menu.

The Bene was OK.  There's simply too much bread. I ate one slab and halfway through that, I moved the other poached egg and spinach onto the half eaten cliff.  The breakfast potatoes were seasoned well and the onion and peppers were very good.  Worth the up charge.  Other than too much bread, my one complaint would be that the eggs were poached too long.  They were not runny when pierced but were semi hard yolks.  

Note:  Saturday and Sunday are the only days they sell the two kinds of Benedicts.

I really liked the inside.  The 60s, tie dyed things, peace symbols, and the music being played that I grew up with made for humming along with the sound track.  It was OK.  There was only one couple besides me in the place and they were at the other end so no one needed to go running out!

The room is almost identical to what it was except for changing some of the decoration and adding a booth seating area.

I was seated at the first two person high top near the entrance.  The place wasn't busy enough to get a counter spot where you can watch the cooks work.

My server was Gracie and she was very good.  She brought a menu and went to get my iced tea.  I asked her about the comparative sizes of the appetizers and other dishes as I was dining solo.  I opted to get the roasted chicken tortilla soup.    For the main course, I ordered the pork chile verde enchiladas.

While waiting for the soup, I munched on too many of the chips and salsa.  The chips are house made tortilla strips rather than chips and the salsa has a small bit of heat.  It's a fire roasted tomato salsa and it's quite good.

In a short time, Gracie brought my soup.  She put the wooden platter in front of me and cautioned me that the cast iron broth holder was VERY hot so I should use care when pouring the contents of the cast iron pot into the soup ingredients which the menu lists as shredded achiote chicken, tomato, cilantro, lime, shredded cabbage, diced avocado, sliced radish, sweet onion, roasted jalapeño, and crispy tortilla strips.  The soup was very good and there's a spicy kick to the broth.  There was one time when some of the spices got to the back of my throat and neither my tea nor a drink of water put out the brief fire.

A problem arrived when a runner brought my main course while I was still eating my soup.  The runner said, ""Oh, I hope I'm not hurrying you.  Here's your enchiladas.""  She then pushed some glasses aside and put the large platter on the table.  I didn't quite finish the soup and then moved the soup holder to the other side of the table and brought the enchilada platter in front of me.

The menu describes the enchiladas as marinated pork shoulder, queso casero, tomatillo salsa, sweet onion, tequila-lime crema, and cilantro.  The enchiladas came with the requisite beans, rice, and small chopped tomatoes, onion, and guacamole to mix in with the enchiladas or eat as a small salad.  The main course was OK.  The enchiladas were fairly standard--nothing that I would walk away remembering.

After finishing, Gracie stopped by to see if I saved room for dessert which she didn't realize was a rhetorical question.  I asked about two desserts that had caught my eye and I ordered the coconut tres leches bread pudding.  She explained it wasn't the standard kind of bread pudding that it was not baked like other bread puddings.  It sounded intriguing so I ordered it and I'm glad I did.

The bread pudding is sort of a cross between angel food cake and sponge cake that has been soaked in the three milks and topped with some coconut pieces on top.  On the side of the dessert was a small pitcher of crème Anglaise to pour over the bread pudding.

Guy, and I think I can call you that because we once had a photo taken together, here are some suggestions.  Instead of having a server take the time to tell me to be very careful about adding the broth to the soup bowl, why don't you have the server do it?  I've been in many high end restaurants where this has been done and it's classy.  Having me dump my broth is not what I'm paying for.  Think of all the photos and/or video that would appear on social media showing the joining of the broth and soup ingredients.  What advertising!  Also, can servers keep an eye on those dining and course the meal better.  If the soup is that hot that I have to be very careful, it's going to take longer to eat.  It isn't rocket science.  A diner should never have their appetizer interrupted by the arrival of the main course unless they've dawdled which I assure you I wasn't.

Note to locals:  El Burro Borracho gives a 25% discount when you show them your Nevada driver's license.  This makes the Strip plus Fieri pricing much more tolerable.

The meal was OK and I may be back.  There are so many other places--cheaper and more authentic--in this town so I'll try many of those before considering a return visit.",20,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The words hand crafted and artisan come to mind when I think of the selections here. After browsing through the delicious sounding menu choices, I decided on an iced honey lavender latte with almond milk. The drink was a lovely sight to behold, with an ombre transition from honey layer, espresso layer, milk, and a delicate dusting of crushed lavender petals on top. The taste, once mixed up, was smooth and refreshing. It was lightly sweet and you could definitely taste the essence of lavender in the drink. After talking with the barista it turns out they use a special lavender bitters to flavor the drink, very nice!

The coffee they use is locally roasted in Phoenix, which is another plus for those that want to shop local. 

Service was warm and very friendly. 

While I did enjoy the latte, I do have a slight preference over the coffee they use at Infusion but this shop comes in a close second for a fine caffeinated brew. Overall 4.5/5.",15,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

There are 5 ladies who do the burlesque and they are quite good.  The show beings with an announcer telling you to, ""Sit back, enjoy, and prepare to be teased.""  Well, that does happen.  The ladies tease quite well.  The music is good and their dances are often quite sensuous.  Some of the best dancing was done with a hoop with two ladies, three ladies on saddles, and  Lola's dance to ""Whatever Lola Wants.""  The one disappointment here was the very promising lady in the large balloon dance.  It had so much promise, but it went unfulfilled.  For their work, the ladies get 4 stars.

A big factor of the one hour show is the comedy of Bruce ""Big John"" Mickelson.  If you've been to shows in Las Vegas very much, you've seen him before.  His act was stale years ago, and he doesn't do this show a favor.  What is supposed to be a comedic break so the ladies and scenery can change turns into an almost tortured attempt at comedy.  Understand, there were only about 20 people at the show tonight--something Big John noted many, many times as he continued to try to milk some laughs from some pretty awful jokes.  The show would do better with an unknown new person.  I expected Big John to break into his old BBQ routine he did at the Stratosphere Hotel years ago.  For this part of the show, 2 stars.

I've tried it at two other restaurants in Las Vegas and I find it very enjoyable.  There was only one other person eating in this small restaurant when I came in about 5:15 PM.  I was shown to a two top near the kitchen doors.  I was surprised how bright and modern the place was.  I expected it to be like some of the other places in the area, small mom and pop places that have a lot of wear and tear.

With the Yelp check in, you get two free egg rolls.  However, I wanted spring rolls so I let the free ones go to order the spring rolls.  I also ordered a combo pho which the menu describes as their pho bomb soup with beef meatballs, tripe, rare beef, well cooked beef and tendon.  The woman who served me soon brought a bottle of water and a cup.  I needed that later.

First up were the spring rolls.  They were good.  The peanut sauce didn't have a rich peanut flavor but it was OK.

Soon the soup came and it was very hot with steam rising from the large bowl.  Before putting any of the vegetables in it, I tasted the broth and it was nice and rich with beef flavor.  The rare beef was rare and there were a number of meatball pieces visible.  The broth also had some spice.  The pho also had some cilantro, white onion slices, and some scallion pieces.  

I tore the spicy Thai basil in pieces and added it to the pho along with all the jalapeño slices, and half of the bean sprouts.  I added some of their house hot sauce to give the broth more kick.  Now I was ready for my eyes to water as I ate this good soup.  I finished the bowl by picking it up and dumping the last into my mouth.  I didn't want to leave any behind.  The meatball slices were very good, the tripe was tasty but few in pieces, and the rare beef was rare.  The tendon was--well tendon.

I had an expired Groupon and this through my server.  She ended up calling her boss and they told her, I'm assuming, to take it at its face value not the double value which is what's supposed to be done.  When the check came, it totaled $4 and some cents.  I paid and left knowing that I have to eat more pho during these cold months.

The menu consists of Mexican food favorites, breakfast items, and frybread. I had the machaca frybread. It was made in record time, perfect for lunchtime eating. The frybread was puffy and slightly crisp around the edges with a heaping portion of oregano-infused, slow cooked shredded beef, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, and green onion. You have your choice of red or green sauce for your frybread as well. Since this is New Mexico style fare, I had to have it XMas style, with both green and red sauce :). It was such a big meal I could only finish about half of it and packed the rest to go. The only slight negative was that I wish the frybread were a little more crisp but that's me being really nitpicky about the meal.

They even have a whole turducken in the freezer section for the ultimate poultry feast! They have a wide range of fresh, frozen, and smoked products, and chances are you will find something you will like to take home (Whether you had planned it or not!).

We came here in search of fresh bacon and some sausages. They have an extensive selection of summer, smoked, and snack sausages in various flavors. They sell 2 different kinds of bacon- applewood and hickory, both double smoked. In addition, there is a varied selection of raw meats, treats, smoked pig parts, and organ meat for your dog. 

Non-meat wise, they have a good selection of wine and beer, various hot sauces, bbq rubs, oils (Including avocado oil), and bbq sauces. They also have a fine selection of various smoker wood chunks and chips, including woods such as cherrywood, applewood, hickory, etc.

The cuts are big here, so go here if you are looking for a hearty meal to cook!

We got some applewood smoked bacon ($8.99/lb.), a pound of Andouille smoked sausage ($6.99), and a smoked pig snout for our dogs ($2.99). The applewood bacon has a lot of moisture in it, so cooking times will be extended to make a crispy piece. The taste was OK, but I prefer The Pork Shop's bacon to Von Hanson's. Von Hanson's bacon was more salty, which hid more of the natural flavor and smokiness than bacon at The Pork Shop. Still, Chandler is a lot closer to us than Queen Creek, so we will be frequenting Von Hanson's for freshly cut meats and pork products!",4,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
if2QbrpNLOIHEgqw-aHpfw,2,2010-12-21,1,D_VfgO71ewi5RwILopLvkA,5,"This is a strenuous 6.5 mile round trip hike down White Rock Canyon to the Colorado River and back.  If you like soaking in a semi-natural hot tub, you'll love this hike.  It's the coming back up the canyon that will kill you.

To get to the trailhead, go across the O'Callaghan-Tillman Memorial Bridge to mile marker 4  on US 93 in Arizona.  There's a dedicated left turn lane where you cross the northbound lanes and enter a newly paved two-lane road that goes up a hill and down to a new paved parking lot.  The trailhead is at the end of that parking lot.

Walk from the end of the parking lot into the wash.  The trail down is evident.  Follow the wash underneath the two bridges and you'll see the National Park Service sign for the trail.  Their mileage is off a bit.  The hike is simply to follow this wash down to Lake Mohave, which is what this section of the Colorado is officially named.  The wash goes back and forth and there are some small pour overs that are easy to walk down.  Notice the geology.  It's stunning.  There is some wonderful pyroclastic rock with many colors.  At one point, there is a huge boulder in the wash that is jaw dropping huge!  

As you approach the river, you'll start to see some moisture along the base of the rocks mostly on the south side.  There is some seepage of warm spring water coming to the surface and making its way to the wash.  There are some cat's claw trees and some more greenery.  The walls of the canyon vary in width and are 100 feet or more tall.

When you reach the river, turn left and follow the trail south.  There are some side trails that lead you astray, but it's easy to get back on track.  Less than 1/2 mile along the river, you descend to a wash.  The hot springs are gotten to by making a left and going up a small canyon to your left.  Straight ahead will take you to the area known as the Arizona Hot Springs beach where there are two outhouses that are for real.  If you arrive here looking for the springs, head away from the river and bear left, not straight, and go around to the back canyon.

As you make your way up this side canyon, you'll come upon a creek flowing toward the river.  The water is cool at first but gets warmer as you walk on.  There are a couple of places where the footing is very difficult.  Sneakers WON'T do for the most part.  I had water shoes on the first time I hiked here.  In any case, take great care in these areas where there's running water that makes the volcanic rock very slippery.  Eventually, you come to a ladder where there's a warm waterfall.  The ladder is new and safe.  The NPS had it installed after the old one was broken off.  

Climb up the ladder and you're at the level of the hot springs pools. The hot tubs are just around the corner upstream. This is more of a changing area.  People have brought sandbags to dam the hot water coming out of the rocks and have made these soaking tubs.  Just look and take some photos  or enjoy some hot tub time before returning.  Coming back is difficult because it's all uphill and you're hiking in gravel that's  tough to walk in.  

Make sure you take plenty of water with you if you do this hike.  Also, make sure you do take the time to go to the beach and enjoy the view.  This is an exceptional place of great beauty!

Happy hiking!",6,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

It was a very good show and I learned something about some of the rock music that I didn't follow.  While I liked the entire show, my favorite part was the early numbers--The Doors, The Who and the Rolling Stones.  When the Woodstock era ended and we sadly put away our bell bottoms, I took a different musical direction.  While I knew many of the songs when I heard them, I could no more identify the name of the song nor the band if Raiding the Rock Vault had not projected the names onto the large screens on stage and on the wings of the theatre.

My email about my ticket advised me that the show was LOUD! (sic).  I took a pair of ear plugs with me just in case, and while the show was loud, it didn't blow me away nor did anyone near me mind the loudness.  To me, it was a standard concert loudness.

Periodically, the screens would display historic information about the group or song that was being sung.  I found this very helpful because I learned as I listened.  Most of the people in the audience were younger than me and most knew almost every word to every song.  I was lucky if I could understand the words they were singing let alone know them to sing with the band.  

I have nothing but good things to say about the quality of the playing and singing.  The band is fantastic.  There's a small story to get the show started--a little goofy--but it serves its purpose and I liked it.  As the show goes along, there are periodic pauses when some of the group does some speaking parts/skits on the sides of the stage.  It's a bit corny, but it too is OK.  It moves the show along from one era to another.

I single out for special attention Tracii Guns and Howard Leese on guitar.  Wow are they good!  The box office person gave me a great seat, the 4th row center, but part of the center section begins with the 3rd row because they've built a ramp for the performers to stand when featuring them.  It was a great seat (see my photos).  As for vocals, the two I enjoyed the most were Andrew Freeman and Robin McAuley.  John Payne, a singer and the producer, was also very good.  

The lighting for the show was very well done and the laser light effects were quite good!  And a word about the LVH Theatre.  Since I was there the last time, they have redone the room.  The old wooden seats are gone and have been replaced with newer seats with cushioning.  They're fairly comfortable.  Also, as stated above, they've built out the front, center of the stage and if you're lucky to get a ticket in that area, you have a great view of the performers up close.  Regardless, the venue has 4 large screens that display the action so anyone can see well.  Since you're here for the music, you really don't have to see them that up close either.

I recommend this show very highly especially if you're a fan of rock music of the 70s and 80s.  I think it's a bit long at exactly two hours, but it certainly is an entertaining two hours with very talented musicians.  

After seeing this show at the historic LVH Showroom, you know that Elvis has left the building.  And so has Manilow.",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I haven't been here since they expanded their space and changed up the menu a bit so we decided to try out Crepe Bar for breakfast today. We got here a few minutes after opening (9 AM on Sunday) and there was already a line 5-6 people deep to order! That gave us time to decide what to get at least. There is a good variety of savory and sweet crepes, various coffee and tea beverages, and a small selection of non crepe items. I had the octopus crepe, tried a bit of the tahini chicken crepe, and shared the dulce de leche crepe to finish our meal. 

While we were waiting for our order the server brought out a small plate of chicharron with dipping sauce. It was a great way to pique our appetite and had a lovely presentation. Our entrees looked even more beautiful, with a well balanced presentation and mix of colors. My octopus crepe was served on 3 small crepes open faced. Because the crepes were thin, and the filling plentiful but crumbly it was hard to get a good bite of filling with crepe. I loved the presentation but I think having a more traditional folded up crepe would make it easier to eat the dish. In general the octopus was tender and flavorful but was slightly chewier than the amazing octopus dish at Virtu and Nico's Heirloom Kitchen. The chorizo in the dish was decent, but after a while I was wishing there were a slightly sweet element in the dish to balance out all the salty flavors. Perhaps a small squeeze of orange would help brighten up the dish.

I tried a bit of the tahini chicken crepe which had a lovely balance of flavors and textures. The chickpeas were a wonderful surprise as they were dehydrated so they tasted crispy and light.

Our dulce de leche crepe for dessert was amazing. The fresh slices of creamy banana went well with the soft crepe, lightly sweet sauce, and crunchy candied pepitas. I would definitely order this again (And again, and again)!

I ordered a Moroccan spiced almond milk latte, which had a subtle hint of exotic spice with a light flavor of honey. It was a well balanced drink. Note that the hot drinks (At least with my latte) are served in a cup that has no handle. My hands got a bit sticky since some of the coffee and milk spilled off the side and I had to grip the cup with both my hands to drink it (First world problems, right?).

This restaurant is quite the cozy little spot, just like a nook! We came here during happy hour and indulged in a discounted appetizer and pizza. We had the poutine with egg, and the Giardino pizza.

The poutine was a heavenly concoction of mozzarella curds, gravy, and perfectly crisp fries. It was my favorite of the two items I had. The mozzarella curds were fresh and soft, with gravy that complimented the fries and cheese well. I liked how the gravy wasn't super salty which allowed for a better balance of flavors. The egg on top provided some extra creaminess and the runny yolk was great with the fries. During happy hour (Daily from 4-6 PM) this dish and other appetizers are $3 off.

The sandwich itself was a large size and had a lot of filling but the croissant tasted quite honestly like something I can buy from Costco (Not to knock Costco croissants at all, but if your business is specifically selling croissants they should taste better than what you can buy at a store).

The latte looked almost white because it was mainly milk and not much coffee. It also tasted pretty much like milk with the barest hint of coffee and vanilla. I got the large size but I wonder if they just used the regular amount of coffee but then loaded up on milk instead of making the drink more proportional and adding more espresso.

We decided on a large size jambalaya and Buffalo chicken potato, with mixed cheese (Monterey jack and cheddar) loaded style (Bacon bits, green onion, sour cream, butter) with fried jalapeños. They both tasted delicious. The jambalaya had a perfectly cooked mixture of shrimp, chicken and sausage, and the Buffalo chicken sauce had the right amount of vinegary tangy flavor. Both were loaded with a hefty amount of toppings and meat, and the combination of textures and flavors was balanced.

The real downfall of this place is the waiting time. This is definitely not fast food as it took 45 minutes for 2 potatoes to be made. I was famished when I got here and had I known it would take so long I probably would have gone somewhere else for a quicker meal. 

Since the space is so miniscule and there isn't a lot of air conditioning when it's warm, your best bet is to place an order ahead of time and get it to go. Overall the potatoes were great but the wait time really killed it for me.",10,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We decided on a Joe-latti, a layered concoction of soft serve and Italian ice. We picked the granny smith Italian ice, which was nice in that it captured the ""essence"" of granny smith flavor, but none of the harsh tartness. It had a light texture that contrasted well with the thick, custard-like soft serve.

While the menu's flavors are extensive, some of the more esoteric ones should have an explanation to what they are. For instance, I'm not even sure I could guess what a ""Joe J"", ""Black Beauty"" or ""monster mash"" is.

There are 40 adult lions and 7 cubs.  Two of the cubs are small enough that you can pay ($30) to have your photo taken with them.  You can touch the fur up to the back of the neck, not forward of it, as some women who had the photo taken told us.

Admission to the ranch is $20 per person.  There are tours that cost more and you can do a trainer for a day which sets you back about two meals at Joël Robuchon.

We were there at 11 AM when the gate rolled back and you're given entrance to the parking lot.  You sign a waiver, pay your money, and go on your way on a walking tour of the pens.  Today was one of the warmest days so far this spring and the adults pretty much were just lying around.  The cubs, on the other hand, were quite active because a handler was in their pen with them and was playing with them.  He'd throw a large ball and they'd chase it and each other.  It was quite fun and the handler was an employee of the company for several years so he had a lot of knowledge to impart.  He readily answered questions.  Very personable guy.

After about an hour and a half, we had seen about all we wanted.  I would give this a full five stars if they'd let me get in and play with the cubs, too, but alas that won't happen!",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I decided to eat there anyway and opted for the bar where I could watch the baseball game.

The bartender, Alyssa, was great.  She asked me if I wanted the two items separately or served together.  Good service.  I opted to have them served together and it was fine.

Within a short time, the sandwich with fries and my elote were delivered.  The food was quite good and I enjoyed my time there.  Portion size is large and I opted not to have dessert after I ate so much which is unusual for me.

After I left, I checked with the slot club and the people at Freedom beat erred.  The club told me, ""Yes, you have $XX to spend.  I think I'll go to Pizza Rock and spend it there.

I checked their music schedule and opted to go at a time when there wasn't any given the loudness of the music mentioned in other reviews.  Thanks for the heads up my fellow Yelpers!

Major fail--icy gelato.  Part way into the gelato I hit a large amount of icy gelato that had been somewhat frozen and thawed a number of times and that's not what gelato is supposed to be.

After a bit of confusion on our part about what to order and the idea of mixing sauces on one pizza-spearate for each half, we got our order in and then had a seat.  This is a no frills, small spot.  My one photo basically shows all the seating except for some not seen on the right.  You get your own plastic ware and napkins from a table to the left of the deli case and there are salt and pepper shakers there and some hot peppers and other spices you might want with Italian food.

We first got fried gnocchi which were OK.  The marinara dipping sauce was good.  Two of us shared a fried rice ball with some tomato sauce and lots of cheese.  It was good.  Next, we had two pizzas.  Yes, three people eating two pizzas.  We got a thin style white pizza and a Sicilian style Margherita pizza.  Needless to say, one of left Cugino's with some leftovers--me.  Andrea enjoyed the pizza tonight.

The pizzas were both good.  I'm spoiled by a white truffle pizza I'm used to getting so this white pizza was a little lacking.  The Margherita was good with a rich sauce and lots of melted cheese.  We also had an order of garlic knots with their good marinara dipping sauce.  For me, this was the star of lunch.  They had good garlic flavor that wasn't lost when dipped in the marinara.

For dessert, we each had a cannoli.  Thank you M.

I ate at Chou's in the same plaza because I was craving good Chinese food and it was an excuse to try the bubble tea from this place afterwards. :) The shop has all your usual bubble tea suspects, with the option to choose what percentage of sweetness you want your tea at. They are currently running an introductory discount of 15% off for their grand opening. 

I saw on the menu they had sea salt cream/foam green tea so I asked for that but the cashier said that it wasn't in season. There's a season for sea salt green tea? Odd, I guess it's a different season in Seattle because I had the same drink at Din Tai Fung a few weeks ago. :p

My second choice ended up being the green milk tea with pudding and I also tried some of the Earl Grey milk tea. We got it to go and as I was sipping it on the drive home it tasted weird and bitter to me. I appreciate that they use fresh tea leaves but it tasted like they had steeped the leaves for too long. The Earl Grey milk tea was similar, bitter like it had been steeped for way too long. 

This is a minor point, but I also thought it was weird they don't use the bubble tea machine that heat-seals a clear plastic cover on top of the drinks. Our drinks had a normal clear beverage top that snaps on top of the cup. It really isn't a deal breaker for me if the finished product tastes good, but I have noticed that bubble tea shops not using the bubble tea machine tend to have inferior bubble tea. Basically, I think of it as, if you aren't willing to spend the money to get the machine that puts the final touch on your typical bubble tea drink, what other corners are you cutting? I'm totally NOT saying they are cutting corners here per se, but this is the image you are portraying to the public. 

The actual shop is pretty cute though, with a huge stuffed bear mascot and a wall with some angel wings so you can take a photo of yourself being all angelic-like. 

I'm hoping they will work out the kinks since they are still new. I'll give them another shot and hope their tea normally doesn't taste bitter!

Remember your milk tea 101: Don't oversteep your tea!

2.5/5.

The casino floor has gotten a bit friendlier with the removal of some of their machines.  The layout now gives you more room, and they have placed several of their machines on 4 machine pedestals that give you lots of room and separation from fellow gamers.

For a starter, I got a small (8 oz.) clam chowder which is done New England style.  It was excellent and it was served mouth burning hot!!  I had a bottle of hot sauce on my table I'd asked for.  The cook asked me how I liked his chowder (Joe, perhaps?) and he asked if I used the hot sauce in the chowder.  I had not, but i saved enough to give the chowder a good shot of the hot sauce.  It is great!  Next time - hot sauce in the chowder from the get go!

I had the large (12) fried clams.  With it I got the seasoned fries (included with the meal) and cole slaw.  Two hush puppies come with this meal, too!  I got a small iced tea.  Refills allowed. 

You order at a counter and then the staff brings your food to you.  The seasoned fries were very good.  I found myself using hot sauce more than the tartar sauce for my clams.  I agree with Candace that there's too much mayo and not enough acidity to balance the mayo.

This is a nice place to stop for a different dinner.  I'm not sure I'd make the trip there often, but it's a good alternative.

I was the first person here at about 11:30 but several tables were occupied before I left.  The server asked me for my drink order.  I got tap water which.  She then said they had a buffet and I replied that was the reason I was there.  She gestured for me to go ahead and start and she'd get my naan.

The buffet is small by comparison to other Indian buffets in town.  There are 8 hot dishes, some salad, and achaar.  It was a good enough choice and the good taste of the food made up for the limited selection.

The naan was buttered generously and was a welcome addition to the meal.

For my first trip, I got chicken tikka masala, malai kofta, and some basmati rice.  The thing I noticed about all of their dishes was they all had a nice spicy flavor.  It's not overpowering for people who like mild food but it had a definite tang and it was not just one dish but all of them.  It was the first time I know that I had malai kofta and it was really a treat!  The last thing was the vegetable pakora.  This was a bit disappointing.  I didn't read the full description because I know what it is.  The only vegetable I could see/taste was potato.  It seemed more like it was a pakora made from bread stuffing and some potato.

For the second plate, I had aloo matar, daal maharani, and curry chicken.  The aloo matar and curry chicken were good.  The daal was OK.  The sign said spicy lentils but this was the only dish that was lacking in spice.  There were some beans mixed in the daal, too.

For dessert I got some rice pudding and some carrot pudding.  The rice pudding was not labeled as kheer and it had a lot of liquid with less rice unlike kheer or rice puddings I've had before.  The carrot pudding, on the other hand, was very thick and unlike the carrot puddings I've had elsewhere.  Both puddings were very good--I'm not criticizing them but merely pointing out the different preparation.  I wish I had seen the achaar at the beginning of my meal.  I didn't think it would be as tasty with dessert!

Service as I said was very good.  When I went for my second plate, my dirty plate was removed and my water glass refilled.  The server was very pleasant.  The room is quite nice and it was very quiet.  

The price is just over $16 including tax.  For the limited selection, it's higher than most places.  Also, you have to park and walk your way through the casino to get there and it's right in the middle, halfway between either garage.

Still, I won't hesitate to stop here and I think I'll try it for dinner some evening.",10,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
vZLAmpN-hTI3GCT9hlHVUA,17,2015-11-16,18,NGQK_nbmvQXTwPsxulC7eg,2,"I joined six friends to try this new restaurant in Aria.  We ordered:

Double order of Caesar salad
Assorted baked clams
Foie gras
Fettuccini con funghi
Spicy rigatoni vodka
Spaghetti Julien
Meatballs
Veal parmesan 
Chicken Scarpariello
Lasagna verde
Bananas flambée
Carrot cake

We were started with two types of bread and each got a piece of parmigiano-reggiano.  We were given menus and then we waited.  It was approximately 45 minutes from sitting down and getting menus until our order was taken.  The captain was busy with other tables and other things and we just waited.  

After ordering, it was not long until the first items came out.  The good items of the meal were the Caesar salad, the foie gras, the spaghetti Julien, and the carrot cake.  The Julien had a very good mixture of flavors that was interesting and quite tasty.  However, there was not one pasta that was cooked anywhere near al dente.  Everything was overcooked something I wouldn't expect from a neighborhood Italian restaurant let alone one in a major Strip hotel.

The poorest example for a dish was the lasagna verde at $75.  It is a large container.  It's cut and served by the captain.  The dish, however, was ruined by the burnt top.  Evidently it was put under a broiler to brown the top but someone blackened part of the top and it permeated every taste I took of my share.  As soon as I tasted the lasagna I said, ""This doesn't taste good.""  When our group doesn't finish everything on every serving plate--and the last piece of lasagna was not finished--you know something is wrong.  We finish dishes.  Not burnt ones, however.

The room was quite loud.  It was very crowded and the noise from conversations filled the room.  The music was great.  It was from my era--basically from 1955 to 1965.  

From the 45 minute wait, one can tell that service was a little lacking.  One thing that hit me wrong in the beginning happened when the captain was going over the specials.  He held a box with two large white truffles and he waved one of Carbone's rather large menus over the truffles so we could get the rich smell of the truffles.  I thought it was very patronizing.

Two of us at my side of our round table had a blast of cold air coming down on us throughout the meal.  We both wore our jackets for much of the meal.  

Having spent $100 including tip, I felt more than a bit disappointed.  There are so many very good Italian restaurants on and off the Strip that are doing better cooking than this and charging less.  Fool me once!",29,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I love how Tempe is growing to be a community of different backgrounds and cultures, and no greater manifestation of this can be shown by the food that is offered here. I had never had cuisine from Yemen before so I was excited to go on a food journey and try some dishes. The restaurant itself is very nondescript and the overhead signage simply says ""Restaurant"". The name of the restaurant is plastered on the front glass walls and on a sidewalk sign though. 

The interior is similarly nondescript, with tables and booths in the front although there does look to be a nice area in the back where people can sit on cushions and eat on a low table. The menu offers various Middle Eastern dishes you will find at other restaurants such as falafel and shawarma but also has a few unique offerings you won't find elsewhere in Tempe. After finding out that  fahsa/salteh (Lamb stew) was the national dish of Yemen, I knew I needed to try it out!

It arrived scorchingly​ hot, so I needed to wait a bit for it to cool down before trying any. I ended up trying a few bites of falafel, hummus and rice from my husband's plate while I waited. I found the to be hummus smooth and creamy, the falafel crisp on the outside with a good texture and flavor on the inside, and the rice to be soft and well seasoned. The stew was so good; I can see why it would be called the national dish! It was bold and spicy, yet had a comforting homey feel to it from the slow cooked, soft lamb to the thick rustic broth. It was served with some pieces of pita. 

Note that they don't seem to offer any glasses of water. All the water is by the bottle in 2 drink cases to each side of the counter. There is also a selection of American and Middle Eastern sodas to choose from. When I asked if they offered cups of water the cashier said they did but when the server dropped off our food and I asked for a cup of water he brought me a bottle of water. 

Our server also neglected to give us any silverware for our meal which I had to remind him to provide to us. Service in general was genial though and we were checked up on as needed.

The menu is simple. You have your choice of various seafood, and an option for chicken for those that aren't seafood-inclined, with various fried sides such as fried zucchini, mushrooms, and fries. I opted to share a 3 piece fish and chips, and tried some fried okra and fried zucchini. The fish and chips had a perfectly crispy crust, with flaky tender fish. The fried okra and zucchini were delicious. The okra was not slimy at all, and the zucchini had a lovely tenderness to contrast with the crisp breading.

After ordering at the counter, you have a plethora of condiments to choose from, such as tartar sauce, vinegar, ketchup, and ranch. The soda fountain is self serve, and they offer good sugar free options such as diet Mountain Dew.

The neighborhood is questionable at best, but if you are in the area or if you want to catch a quick bite before a show at Celebrity Theater this is a good option.",7,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I ordered the Fruit fantasia waffle, a good sized waffle topped with seasonal fresh fruit and served with boysenberry syrup and butter and whipped cream or sour cream for a topping.  The waffle had a lot of fruit--bananas, grapes, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and strawberries.  It was excellent.

raVyoZbWWuN7JcFUdT7k2g,5,2013-05-06,2,qioIgCr30-MMGIhXycNtlA,5,"Asian-fusion cuisine at its finest. Sochu House serves up innovative tapas-style Asian bites, as well as larger entrees and noodle dishes. The cuisine spans several types of Asian regions, with a hint of Western influence. 

We ventured in on a Sunday night for dinner. Since there was a Groupon for Sochu House expiring soon (One of the reasons why we went that day), there was a slight wait since it appeared to be a little busier than usual for them (15 minutes). We browsed through the menu, and ordered a few tapas items, and shared an entree.

The tapas is served izakaya-style, in that it's served to you as it's made. We tried the soup gyoza, the sochu tofu, and another dish that escapes my mind. The soup gyoza was excellent. The pork filling was juicy, tender, and the broth inside the dumpling was divine. The outer dough of the dumpling was perfectly cooked. The only slight negative was that it was served on a dish. I would have liked it to be served in a bowl so I could spoon up the rest of that lovely broth more easily! The sochu tofu was also very good. The tofu was perfectly crisp on the outside, with a soft tofu texture on the inside. The dipping sauces were very nice.

While the entree was good (Red curry with chicken), the real standouts were the tapas. The curry had a myriad of vegetables, including some okra, which I appreciate as an ingredient in any cuisine, but for me it tasted too gummy/slimy (As okra tends to be) compared to the other vegetables. It was a generous portion of curry, although rice is served on the side and is an extra charge.

The location is a bit odd, as it's in a strip mall neighboring fast-food type establishments (e.g., a Coney Island dog place), and is across the street from Honey Bear's BBQ. 

I love frequenting restaurants where the chef works hard to create delicious, creative meals, and the passion of chef Johnny Chu shows in each bite of delicious tapas. They are open late too, which is another plus. Sochu House is a definite gem in this Phoenix neighborhood!",8,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Won't you take me to... Koreatown!
Won't you take me to... Koreatown
(Cue string instruments)

Anyways, Koreatown is in the newly revitalized shopping center on Broadway Rd in the AZ International Market plaza. You can't miss the giant red letters if you are driving there on Broadway. We ate here for dinner tonight. The restaurant is spacious and nicely decorated with a relaxing atmosphere. 

We ordered the beef bulgolgi hot stone bimbimbap and a spicy chicken bulgolgi to share. While we waited for our main entrees our server presented us with a wide selection of banchan such as fish cake, marinated cucumber, kimchi, bean sprouts, and eggplant. My favorites of all of them were the cucumber and eggplant. The kimchi tasted mild and too sweet for my tastes.

The dishes came out and looked amazing. The hot stone bimbimbap smelled heavenly and had a sizzle that was music to my ears. I found it odd that the beef was hidden in a small mound underneath the sunny side up egg. Wouldn't you want to showcase your main meat in your dish? The bowl itself was colorful with lots of vegetables and pleasing to the eye though and the bits of caramelized rice at the bottom of the bowl are always one of my favorite parts of this meal. 

The spicy chicken was coated with a red pepper sauce with onions on top and bottom of the dish. Overall, both dishes were enjoyable, but I wish the bimbimbap had more rice to go with it, and the spicy chicken's taste was a little sweeter than what I've had at other Korean restaurants. I did like how a bowl of rice was automatically included with the spicy chicken plate. At other restaurants they charge by the bowl.

Prices for some items seemed a little higher for some dishes, such as the $29.99 casseroles (Meal for 2) but since I didn't order them they might be a ton of food for your money so I can't really pass too much judgement. I was disappointed that my $1.50 soda was not a fountain drink but by the can. I'll be getting iced tea or plain water next time!

There are tables by the booth seats and there are very comfortable stools to sit at the tables.

I had eaten at home and all I wanted was a diet Coke.  The barkeep last night was a very delightful young woman with a tremendous smile and a very welcoming demeanor.  She got my Coke and then some of the members of the group started to arrive.

While I was there, one of the partners in this new business came by and introduced himself and the executive chef stopped by to talk about the menu.  Everyone was very polite, friendly, and accommodating.  It was a pleasant place for us to discuss our book and for those that had food, they enjoyed what they had.

I opted for a mint chip ice cream center with a double chocolate cookie and a mint chip cookie for the extremities. It was a lovely blend of textures and complementary flavors.

La Piazza is right across the street from Cityscape next to Cartel Coffee and is certified by Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana so you know this is legit Neapolitan style pizza. 

In addition to pizzas they have salad, paninis, pasta, and a few appetizers. We started out with the arancini appetizer (AKA Palle di Riso) and shared the Napoletana pizza. The arancini was superb. It had a perfect crispy fried outer coating with perfectly cooked risotto, small chunks of prosciutto, rapini, and mozzarella. It was topped with arugula and covered in a delightful tomato sauce. The flavors and textures complimented each other well. I'd definitely get this again!

I wasn't a fan of the flavors in my pizza. The toppings for the Napoletana are anchovies, olives, parmesan, capers, mozzarella, fresh basil, and tomato sauce. I should have known that this would be a super salty pizza based on the ingredients alone. I had never had anchovies on a pizza before, and the ones on my slices were so salty I had to take them off and eat them without the fish. It wouldn't look as nice but for me if they were chopped into smaller pieces that would disperse the flavors out more. The olives, parmesan, and capers additionally added to the salt level so in general I felt like it was a very unbalanced tasting pizza. I did enjoy the sauce, fresh mozzarella and lovely crust though. The crust was crisp with a slight outer char on the outside with a tender chewiness on the inside. 

As for drinks, you should definitely get the iced tea. It's made by Infusion Coffee and Tea in Tempe, and the desert blossom tea I tried was so flavorful and refreshing. 

Service was not the friendliest but got the job done. Drinks were refilled as needed and we were checked up on adequately.

The omelette was delivered and it was good.  I didn't taste the garlic but the feta cheese sauce was good.  Serving the avocado on a separate plate was a good idea so everything didn't get mushed together on one dish.

We started with the spring rolls. They were crispy, nicely fried, with a delectable mixture of veggies, ground pork, and shrimp. We each got a sizable portion of dipping sauce to go with the rolls, which I appreciated.

We also got the pho ga, and the #59 rice porridge (Mixed meats- squid, shrimp, fish meatball, pork, and imitation crab). The pho ga had a sizable portion of chicken and noodles, and came with a heaping platter of bean sprouts, greens, and limes on the side. The broth was very light tasting compared to other restaurants. The rice porridge was nicely seasoned, but also a ""lighter"" type of rice porridge, with more liquid and less rice than I usually see at similar restaurants. There were about 2 pieces each of shrimp and squid, a few pieces of imitation crab, and some scattered slices of pork in the mixture.

I also ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee. It took a long time for all the coffee to drip down into the glass, but once it was ready, it was a thick potent concoction, strong, smooth, and sweet.

Service was very basic. Aside from taking the order and bringing out food and drinks, we didn't really have anyone check up on us. I had to grab my own straw from the packaging table, and grab my own to-go container to package up my leftover rice porridge. We paid for our bill at the cashier's table.

 In general, this is probably a good park for your dogs to play if they are bigger, love to play in the water, and are pretty friendly, but for shy, timid, small dogs that prefer more shade and a more relaxed atmosphere, this is probably not for them.",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I'm still a big fan of the rod burro, but it's such a big meal that I usually only get it if I'm starving or sharing it with someone. Some of my current favorites are the cheese crisps with guacamole or with green chile, the veggie burro, the chicken and bean burro, and the tacos are still quite good. The salsa is still nicely hot and spicy, and the addition of carne asada, fish, and breakfast adds to their menu variety. While I appreciate that they're branching out with new foods, the fish tacos that I tried when they first introduced them to the menu were really not very appealing. They were overcooked, bland, and super oily. Hopefully they've perfected their recipe since then!

The outdoors seating is nice when the weather is not too hot, and they don't mind if you bring your dog with you to sit outside.

The shrimp were good, but I did skip having any sushi.  Instead, I loaded up on some kimchee and then on to the gelato area for my dessert fix.

Today, we went for breakfast.  It's always a nice way to start the day.  A bit of chopped chicken liver, some smoked salmon, and a small sampling of oatmeal with raisins, brown sugar, and cinnamon.

To get there, drive to Boulder City and continue straight on Nevada Way to Utah Street.  Do NOT head for Hoover Dam.  Make a right on Utah Street and follow it until it ends at the Boulder City garbage transfer area.  Turn right onto a graded road and follow it for less than a mile.  You'll see a left turn for a gun range.  Turn left here and follow this road for a short time.  There is another turn to get to the gun range.  DO NOT take that left turn.  Continue to the next left and then go down a steep hill that runs along the south side of the gun range.  You'll soon enter the Lake Mead National Recreation Area.  Inside the fenced area is where you park if you do not have a 4x4.  This will make your hike 8 miles round trip.  

If you do have a 4x4, continue driving down the wash for another two miles.  The rocks are sharp in places and close to each other, so drive this with care.  At the end of the 2 miles, you'll come to the trailhead--a place that's wired off so vehicles can't go any more.  Park here.

From here, follow the wash as it heads to the Colorado River.  The rock formations are amazing and the views are great!  At about 1/3 mile from the trailhead, you come to a 15 foot dry fall that's easy 3rd class.  The best side to scramble down is on the left as you're looking down the wash.  Take care, but this isn't a hard down climb.  

As you near the end of your wash, the canyon narrows and soon you come to the end of this part of the hike.  The end is a 20 foot dry fall you can only get down using ropes.  There are some hooks in the rock above, but I would not recommend you do this.  At the bottom of the dry fall is a pool like area in which I've never seen water.  Beyond this small pool is a high pour over that's more than a 300 foot drop.  Enough said.  You don't need to explore down there!

The next part of the hike entails retracing your steps about 3/10 of a mile.  Look to your left as you're hiking back and you'll see a use trail leave the wash and go up a hill.  Follow this trail which has some ups and downs and eventually it will lead you to a magnificent view of the Colorado and the Black Canyon Wilderness area.  This is a good place to have a snack and take photos.

When you're done, go back to the wash and head back to your car.  This is a great hike with lots of pretty vistas.  Wear hiking boots and take water.  A Camelbak is best!

The staff were quite friendly and polite in moving such a large group of people into Hall A for the opening festivities before Hall B opened and the gamers could get at their controllers and try the games.

One drawback for some would be the long walk.  I parked at the Palazzo and came through restaurant row and then hung a left to the convention center.

Out of all the dishes, my favorite was the XO beef, which had a nice deep flavor with very tender beef.  The other meats were also very tender, and were actually not too spicy compared to the Tom Yum soup.  While the meat and the tofu was nicely cooked, the flavors of the dishes in general were just OK.

All the ingredients here are fresh and well prepared.  The hot buffet today consisted of pancakes, breakfast quesadilla, applewood bacon, pork sausage, and roasted potatoes.  The bacon was excellent- perfectly crispy, not at all chewy, with great subtle smokey flavor, not too salty at all.  The potatoes were also excellently cooked,  as well as the sausage.  The quesadilla was decent, but tasted a bit too cheesy for me.  They have an omelet and Belgian waffle station as well, made to order.  The omelet I had was excellent- very fluffy with fresh ingredients.  The cold selections are also diverse and flavorful as well.  There is a wide selection of fresh fruit, pastries, cheese and bread, smoked salmon, and divine fruit and granola parfaits.  I'm sure these parfaits aren't really that healthy for you since they taste so good, but they are probably some of the best breakfast items I've had in a long time!

Last night, we had a play at Las Vegas Little Theatre and I had some comp dollars from Binion's, so we finally made it here.  I hadn't been in the restaurant since it was known as Top of the Mint many years ago.

As others have said, it's a classic steakhouse and you have a great view.  We were there early and enjoyed our time looking out the window and picking out things we didn't know were around the area.

For the meal, we each started with onion soup.  It was good with a hearty beef broth and tasty cheese.  I ordered the 10 ounce NY steak and my wife ordered the 8 ounce filet.  It came with choice of starch--we each chose the garlic mashed potatoes--and seasonal vegetable which last night was yellow and green squash.  Both steaks were tasty.  Mine was done a bit to much.  It should have been rarer but it wasn't egregious enough to send it back.  

For dessert, we took a look at the dessert tray brought by our waiter, Jeff, and we opted for the same dessert, a chocolate volcano--a small bundt cake made of chocolate and filled with heated chocolate.  It was very good.

A couple of things to note.  Service was very good.  Jeff has been at the steakhouse for a number of years and he's a good server.  I never wanted for a refill of my iced tea and the bus people were there to remove dirty plates when a course was finished.  The view is as good as everyone points out.

I love Tempe. The city is vibrant, bustling, and is one of the more progressive places to live in Arizona. A lot of people only associate Tempe with ASU but there's so much more. I think there's a little bit of something to do for everyone. The parks are a peaceful and relaxing place to spend a few hours, with activities available like paddle boarding at Tempe Town Lake. Although the city is relatively flat, you can do some hiking on Hayden Butte/A mountain. If you are super hardcore into athletics, there is the Ironman competition held at Tempe Town Lake every year. For those into the bar scene there's Mill Avenue and some notable local breweries like Four Peaks. Family activities are also plentiful, such as the Festival of the Arts and our gorgeous Tempe Public Library. The Tempe Arts Center provides various cultural shows and entertainment. If shopping is your vice, Tempe Marketplace offers a wide variety of stores to choose from. Last but not least, there's the FOOD! You can find such a wealth of restaurants to choose from here. Ethiopian, Chinese, Malaysian, Thai, Laotian, Japanese, Indian, Mexican, Middle Eastern, or if you simply want a damn good burger, you can find what seems like a limitless selection of places to satisfy any food craving you might have. Tempe is also home to the very first Cold Stone Creamery which is still in business today! How cool is that?

With a series of fans in a circle, the air is circulated such that two large pieces of silk like cloths float up and down on the currents.  Whoever thought this up was quite creative.  It is mesmerizing and difficult not to watch them as they float.

Tonight, the show consisted of four main acts interspersed with comedy and magic from the MC, Michael Finney.   Finney was a little lethargic at the beginning of the show and the audience didn't warm up to him.  

He quickly introduced Ed Alonzo, a comic magician who is billed as ""The Misfit of Magic.""  Alonzo was quite funny and was a treat.  The brick part was indeed very funny!

Second came Juliana Chen.  She had a different beginning to her set, but it became tedious after awhile when she kept making more and more playing cards appear.  I was sitting in the front row on the side and I figured out how she was doing her trick.  It did grow old quickly.

Third segment was the shadow figures by Sonny Fontana made with his hands and with the help of an assistant.  Some are very clever when he imitates famous people.  At the start, however, the animal he was making was shown on a video display.  If you have to show us what you're making, you're not confident of how well we'll know what you're making.

The last segment was magician Kevin James who was on Season 2 of America's Got Talent.  I saw AGT probably three times in the years it's been on and I saw one of the nights when he performed.  This is a very entertaining and funny segment of the show.  James is very good.  Given my seating, I did see something that helped explain one part to me.

In between the acts, Finney did some magic and card tricks with audience members.  He was OK but there was nothing that was new here.  I simply was to give the crew time to ready the stage for the next segment.

Summary:  The show is new and it needs to pick up the pace a bit.  Chen needs to vary her routine more.  The stars are Alonzo and James.  The show started with a bang and ended the same way.  It is misnamed because there's no cutting edge, avant garde routines with the show, but it's worth seeing.  Get discounted tickets at Tix4Tonite or something like that.",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Anchored by the Regal Village Square Theatre complex, the center had shops of all kinds from a bakery with fine teas to a low cost hair cutting place.  Over a period of time, new businesses took the place of others that closed and the center seem to lose a bit of its original luster.

Then the great recession hit and the place became like a ghost town.  There were more empty stores than open ones and some of the businesses had a hard time hanging on and staying in business.

In the last year, the owners of the plaza announced that they were going to renovate the exteriors and generally make the place a more pleasant area.  New palm trees have been planted, the store fronts have a fresh coat of paint, but best of all they have changed the way you enter and park in the center.  Previously, you had to go east or west and then park in rows facing north and south.  Today when I went to get take out from Archi's Thai Café, I noticed that the parking is wonderful.  You can go right straight through and park in an east/west direction.  This makes so much better sense.

There are some new stores coming including a new Mexican restaurant.  Those holding on have been Archi's, Tropical Smoothie Café, Alligator Soup crafts store, and Cold Stone Creamery.

I was really looking forward to eating the gingerbread French toast, and I was imagining that it was actual toast made with gingerbread seasoned batter. I was surprised when the meal came out and it was in fact, an actual slice of gingerbread. Unfortunately, it was only very lightly battered and fried, so I didn't really get much of a French toast feeling for me, and it was too crumbly and sweet for me. To add a holiday item to your slam is an extra $.50, which isn't bad in the grand scheme of things, but next time I won't go out of my way and pay extra for the French toast I had.

I stopped here for a combined lunch/dinner.  With the help of my server, Anelia, I ordered a sensible amount of food--more than normal for lunch but large enough to be dinner too and not be hungry at 7 PM.

I ordered and iced tea and I was brought some house made bread.  I ordered the Bulgarian feta with lukanka, egg, and tomatoes in a super hot small black pot.  This was my appetizer and it was a great starter.  The melted feta was really good and the lukanka--Bulgarian style salami--was quite good.  The hot tomatoes mixed in also added to the good flavor.

I had a harder time language-wise while trying to pick the main course.  Anelia suggested the special of the day, which sounded to me like some kind of meat that was going to be stuffed in paper.  Sounded good so why not?  It turned out that it was stuffed peppers, you know, stuffed papers.  They have an appetizer that's red peppers stuffed with feta, but this is only done as a special.  

When I was a youngster, I didn't think of my mother's stuffed peppers as food but rather as punishment.  These were a bit different but somewhat the same.  The peppers were red peppers.  They were stuffed with a ground beef and rice combination but instead of a tomato sauce topping, they were topped with a sour cream sauce.  The filling need salt.  It really was bland.

For dessert, I had what they call French cake.  Anelia had a difficult time describing it to me but it's layers of cream cheese, very thin pastry, and raspberry sauce.  It was a very refreshing dessert for our summer heat!

I really need to come back here and try more.  I'm sure I've only scratched the surface.

High tea was something I've wanted to do for a long time but my wife was not interested and some other people I spoke to about going were not enthusiastic.  ""Meh"" was a common word.  OK then, I'll go myself.  Playing myVegas on Facebook, I earned enough points to redeem for the High Tea for one.

I made a reservation for 2 PM.  I went to the mLife club at about 1:15 and after giving her my confirmation number, I had my comp and had time to walk around the Bellagio and watch tourists.  It's great people watching.

At 1:55, I went to the podium at the entrance to the Petrossian, she checked her roster and saw I had a reservation, and she took me to a table that had been set up for one.  She gave me the menu, a quick explanation, and said my server would be by soon.

The rules, if you will, are each person gets to choose four finger and/or open faced sandwiches.  Each person gets two scones and three mini pastries.  And of course, there's the tea which you pick from a selection on the next page in the menu.   For sandwiches, I ordered (1) Smoked turkey, brie, and black grapes on a cranberry bread; (2) chickpea panella, roasted red pepper, green olive mayo on spiced bread; (3) Alaskan king crab and avocado on brioche; and (4) Smoked salmon topped with Transmontanous Oscietra caviar on pumpernickel bread.  (descriptions are from the menu).  My favorite was the smoked turkey.  The cranberry bread was very tasty.  All four made good bites and had good flavors.

There were two cranberry scones and with the scones came three mini containers with clotted cream, butter, and lemon curd.  These were for use with the scones.  The scones were luscious.  They were much better than you get at coffee stores.  Very fresh, very high in butter content, and baked perfectly.  I didn't use any of the butter.  I tried the clotted cream and the lemon curd.  Hands down, the lemon curd was a winner!

The three small pastries were nice to help fill me up. The best of these was a small chocolate, custard tart that had a chocolate coffee bean in shape and taste on top.  This was the winner of this bunch.   For tea, I chose the loose leaf Darjeeling.  

My server, Mary Ann, was very pleasant and came around and poured more hot water into my teapot and I was able to sit after the sandwiches and pastries and enjoy the Bellagio again watching tourists go by.

A few things about the experience.  Even though they have the live pianist, where I was seated, it's enough distance away that it was not so easy to hear them play.  The casino music easily drowned out the pianist but that didn't spoil anything--that's just an observation. Second, men's fingers are not built for tea cups like this.  I don't expect a diner type coffee cup, but to pick up my cup, I look like I had just come in from the barn and was sitting down to have some of ma's good tea.  

I'm glad I had the comp.  At $35 per person plus tax, I may not have done it on my own.  It is something one should do just for the experience.  Go with friends and chat and laugh and share and I think it would be a lot more fun.",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I had a plain cheeseburger, and it seemed like just your typical fast food burger. This was before I knew about the now not-so-secret menu. 

I went in again to try their burgers again, this time ordering a cheeseburger- animal style, with a Neapolitan shake. The burger had a soft bun to go with the grilled burger meat, melted cheese, crisp lettuce and fresh tomatoes. Animal style is the way to go, because of the extra depth of flavor from the mustard-grilled burger, extra pickles, and chopped caramelized onions. The extra thousand-island type sauce helps too.

Compared to other fast food chains, you get a really good value for your meal here. The extra ingredients for ""animal style"" don't cost any extra, and the burger meat tastes way better than something similar for the same price elsewhere. The veggies were very fresh, as opposed to the wilted veggies you find in some places from burgers sitting out on heat lamps for who knows how long.

The neopolitan shake was pretty tasty. It's another ""secret menu"" item, and while I've never had a chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla shake all in one, this will not be my last!

I wasn't too impressed with the fries, despite being freshly cut and fried. They tasted a bit dry and crumbly.

We waited to be seated for about 15 minutes which was OK except for the fact that there were several empty tables.  They're just understaffed enough they can't clear all the tables to accommodate the arriving guests.

Our server, Leo, was a personable young man and answered questions we had.  He's the reason this isn't the two star rating I'd normally give for the food.

Le Burger Brasserie--good burgers and such.  No, not really.  They're burgers made from frozen patties.  They are so uniform in diameter and thickness they have to be packaged ahead of time.  I asked for mine rare but it was more toward medium rare.  My wife asked for hers medium and hers was cooked the same as mine.

The burgers were not at all juicy.  They look pretty, so to speak, because they come in their paper-lined metal basket with the side of lettuce and tomato.  I got a bleu burger and my wife got the Le Paris, a burger with brie cheese, caramelized onion, bacon.  My burger had bleu cheese and bacon with a half avocado on the side.  You also get to choose from among 4 or 5 options for the kind of bun you want for the burger.  When I leave a burger place and the things that stick in my head about the meal are the avocado and the bleu cheese, then it wasn't a great burger experience.  

For dessert, we shared the beignets, 5 small rounds filled with mascarpone and served with chocolate dipping sauce and whipped cream.  They were OK, but nothing I'll remember.

Spending an hour and a half having a burger is also too long.  It turned out to be alright because I was watching the college football game on their big screen.  We got out in just enough time to walk to the Jubilee! Theatre for our show and we had some time to spare.

I had been to the original one and I wanted to try this.  I was going to stop the week before but remembering it was Mother's Day and I knew the place would be slammed, I waited a week to go.

I went inside and had my name put on the list and requested a patio table.  When I was taken outside, I was told to pick any place I wanted.  I chose a two top in the sun. 

I was left a menu and as I looked at it, my server stopped by and asked about coffee.  I ordered the French press coffee which says 2 cups.  It yielded three plus.

I ordered the S'mores waffle.  It was a waffle with some marshmallow fluff, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, and some Chex cereal for the graham cracker.  With the waffle I was served warm maple syrup with some cinnamon sticks infusing the syrup and two small cups of soft butter.

The waffle was good but I was expecting more marshmallow and less whipped cream, and Chex cereal is not really a good replacement for graham cracker.  Some squares of real graham cracker would have been better.

Service was good but I must note that I don't understand the seating problem this place seems to have.  Evidently, one person write names down, where the person requests to sit, and then hands off the person with a menu to one person who seats people coming in.  The patio was 1/3 full, the interior was about the same, and yet I waited for about 5 minutes before being shown outside.  It just seems like an inefficient system and when they're busy, I can understand the reason for the backup.

One note, if you ride here on your bike--yeah, I know, few of you will--you can lock it up using the boards on the ramp going to the entrance as the anchor for your cable and lock.

FYI, your options are fried seafood, Mediterranean, burgers, cheesesteak, wings, and even poke bowls. (OK I'm done with the annoying internet acronyms for now :) )

After browsing through the mind-boggling variety of options I finally decided on sharing a cheesesteak (The Neighbor Affair) and the Mo's chicken shawarma fries. We redeemed a check in offer for a free drink which allowed us to indulge in some Kool-Aid from the many flavors available. The peach mango flavor I had was quite refreshing and good. Other drink options from the fountain area included various iced teas and sodas. 

The food only took a few minutes to make and looked delicious. I enjoyed the flavors of the pastrami and thinly sliced beef with melted Swiss cheese and grilled onions. I would have liked more onion in my sandwich though to provide some more textural difference. The bread was soft and went well with the meat and cheese. 

The Mo's shawarma fries were an admirable size, filled with chopped chicken, sauce, peppers, onion, and mushroom. Unfortunately the mushroom was an unwanted item that wasn't in the menu description and there was actually supposed to be tomato in it instead. The peppers and mushroom both tasted like they were from a can or jar, and I wasn't too impressed with the sauce. I did enjoy the lightly crisp fries though. The fries also came with a side of hummus. Quite honestly I really hated the hummus. It had a weird consistency of goopy texture with small chunks dispersed throughout the dip. It had a strange metallic aftertaste to me. I could only take one bite before deciding to take mercy on my tastebuds.

In general, I'm not sure I would get something from the Mediterranean side of this eatery based on what the shawarma fries tasted like but I would be up for trying another cheesesteak. L8R, WtfExp!",14,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I went to several places in search of the right combination of tiles for my remodeling project, but only at Monterrey Tile did I find both a great sales rep and a wide selection of ceramic/porcelain tile, natural stone, and mosaics. Eric was excellent in converting the schematic we had drawn out for our remodel and turn it into reality. He was very knowledgeable about what they had in stock, and provided several different tile combinations that would look amazing in our bathroom. 

In addition to natural stone tiles such as travertine, shale, and limestone, they also sell a plethora of options in ceramic tile, including wood-like ceramic planks. Some of them were so realistic you wouldn't know they weren't natural stone (Or wood). They also sell mosaics, from the basic rectangular glass tiles to a lovely wavy pattern mix of glass and marble. Prices were very competitive compared to the other companies I looked at. One set of tiles I ended up buying were actually cheaper here than buying the almost exact same quality, shape, and appearance of tiles at Costco (Yes, apparently they sell ceramic/porcelain tiles at Costco now!).

Once our order was placed, Eric was great at providing updates to when our order would come in. 

If I ever need to buy more tile for another remodeling project, this is the place I will go!",5,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,9,2014-08-03,8,OsY8ufBeQmuBSRPcu5DEhA,4,"I came here with two Yelp friends, Michael U. and Chris V., to try the restaurant's new breakfast menu.  I was here opening night and wanted to make a return visit.  The new breakfast menu was a good reason to go.

We were seated promptly and was brought our coffee.  There was a question about the coffee they used and the server was a little flustered.  More on that later.  We were brought two cups of regular coffee.  We ordered four items that were to be brought as two separate courses.  That's exactly what was done.

We started with the chicken fried bacon biscuits and gravy and the Dragon's Breath chili cornbread Benedict.  The chicken fried bacon was nothing special except for the different take on the normal breakfast dish.  The biscuits were flavored perfectly and the pepper flavored gravy was good.  The cornbread of the Benedict was very soft and tasty.  For me, Dragon's breath indicates a hot, spicy flavor.  While there was some heat, it was certainly no Dragon.  But that's my taste buds.  I completely liked this dish.

During our eating, the executive chef, Anthony Leitera, came to the table to respond to our question about the Stumptown coffee that had been asked of the server.  He couldn't answer the question and said he'd send the beverage person to answer.  Before he left, he checked on how we were enjoying breakfast.

The server then brought out part 2 of our order, shortbread pancake and berry pot pie and maple bacon French toast.  I thoroughly enjoyed the pancake pot pie.  I agree with Chris V.'s comments about it falling apart easily.  The pancakes were very soft and the berry filling tended to make cutting and sharing a bit difficult.  I didn't use any of the syrup with the pancake as I tend to eat them without syrups.  The maple bacon French toast was quite good.  Once again the bacon was the weak point.  The candied bacon was nothing special but I really liked the French toast and the brûléed banana slices.  Again, I used no syrup.  The French toast was very moist throughout although the ends were not cooked crisp.

With each dish we received a small glass of juice that was watermelon, orange, and grapefruit combination that was a nice palate cleanser.

During our time there, the GM, Michael Speagle, stopped by to see how we were doing and thank us for our patronage.  

Enough time had gone by that the lunch menu was now available so we decided to share one more dish--the S'mores Monte Cristo.  It's a Monte Cristo made from brioche with a graham cracker butter and stuffed with marshmallow and chocolate and served with chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces.  We used the sauces not for dipping but for pouring over.  This was a excellent!

We had a glitch with the splitting of checks the way we planned but that was rectified.  

While I'm probably not going to be here often, I can see myself returning with a friends to split like we did today.  The process are Strip prices.  Note to Total Rewards members--$1 off each menu item with your TR card.",11,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I got the Lechon plate ($8.50), which included about 4 pieces of deep fried pork belly with crispy skin, a scoop of rice, and some pickled veggies (Carrots, radish, red bell pepper).  The order took a little time to be made, as there was a backup of orders from some customers wanting a lot of extras (Like 8 cups of soy sauce, or 6 to-go boxes for their plates), so the food wasn't out in quick time like I was expecting for a food truck.  The staff were very friendly though, and it's nice that they offer credit card for you to pay (No minimum order), and will send you your receipt through your e-mail.  

The lechon was very rich and flavorful.  It had a mix of juicy pork and crispy skin from being deep fried.  Although they give you just a few pieces, it is a pretty heavy tasting dish, and it was nice to add the rice and vegetables as lighter sides to balance out the meat.  Although very tasty, the price was a little high, considering I can get a pound of lechon for the same price at Heavenly Bakeshop in Chandler.

Overall, it's nice to see some more uncommon foods here in the Phoenix area such as Filipino cuisine, and I'd like to visit their food truck again to try some more dishes.",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Went here for a late breakfast and our waitress was apologetic and mentioned that our meal would probably take 20-30 minutes to make because they were backed up with orders in the kitchen.  They brought out a fruit plate for free, which had fresh, sweet pineapple and melon, to tide us over until our breakfast came in, which was nice.  I had ordered an iced coffee, and when it came out, I was confused because it looked like iced tea.  Turns out, it was just really watery coffee with ice cubes in it= blegh.  

Our breakfasts were both hearty, fresh, and flavorful.  Portions were large.  I had the corned beef hash, made with freshly torn up pieces of corned beef, onions, and potatoes, and poached eggs.  The rye toast that came with it was very nice as well.  Usually I pay no attention really to toast that comes with my meal, but this toast seemed better than others, since it was perfectly grilled and had the right amount of crispiness.  Prices were ok for breakfast considering the amount of food we received.  Generally everything on the menu is less than $10 for breakfast.

Would I go here again?  Maybe, if I'm in the mood for deli food or a sit-down breakfast and I'm in the downtown Tempe area to start with, but I probably wouldn't venture out to Mill Ave. just to eat here.",0,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
FDY7wagp7-rfjopJDRARbA,3,2013-08-14,1,TL2iEM6zCgVZbiS25GeLrQ,5,"We saw Celine two times when she was here with the first show ""A New Day"" and planned on seeing her show after she returned to the Colosseum.  Last night was the night.

The show is very different from A New Day and it is excellent!  They have expanded the LED panel at the rear of the stage with projection screens on both sides of the stage.  That increases the amount of projection space available and it's put to good use in several sequences.

The biggest change with the show is the amazing 26 piece orchestra.  They are excellent and it gives a completely different feel to her show from the smaller band with few or no strings.  She sings a few of her standards--I was glad she did a bit of ""It's All Coming Back To Me Now"" as it's one of my favorite songs that she does.  The show is also different because the dancers are gone.  There is an intimate little combo set with music different from what you'd think of Celine.  The performers showcased while she was changing were also good--the violinist, some of her vocalists, etc.  

The planned encore was ""My Heart Will Go On"" from the movie ""Titanic.""  There was a time when I was so sick of hearing this song, I thought I'd slash my wrists if I ever heard it again.  Last night, I was missing it for some odd reason.  As the encore, it's really well done and a fantastic end to a good show.

A few things to note:  Celine never starts on time.  I've seen her 4 times at the Colosseum and she's started ten minutes (at least) late each time.  That's partly because Las Vegas audiences are notoriously late and we don't start without them and shut them outside until there's a break.  Colosseum people take note.  Start on time and seat late comers whenever.  I saw one person enter 45 minutes into a 90 minute show!  Way to go _ _ _.

The show will be here for a few more years and I can't imagine that we won't be going back to see it again.  And although it's been two years since Celine returned to Las Vegas at the Colosseum, I can say bon rétour à notre Québécoise.",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

This is not a gym for everyone.  The hours are not convenient for a 24 hour town.  Their hours are:   Monday to Thursday, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; and Saturday 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  They are closed on Sunday.  They used to open at 6 AM and they were open on Sundays, but budget cuts and staff reductions have forced shorter hours.

If your schedule fits these times, it's a great place to go.  The people who go there vary in age - well maybe there are a few more retired people than the 30s range, but it a nice group.

There are tow main rooms for most people - the fitness room and the weight room.  The fitness room has 8 treadmills, 2 stair steppers, 4 ellipticals, and 4 stationary bikes.  The weight room has a nice variety of weight training equipment and there is a good collection of free weights.

In addition to these two areas, the facility has larger rooms where yoga classes and dance classes are held.  There is a standard gymnasium where we play paddle tennis several days a week.

While this place may not be for all, it's a great little gym to join and enjoy.

I was looking forward to a sit down spot and Fukuburger is in FAME.

There are 6 burgers from which to choose.  I ordered the Karai burger.  It's a Fuku patty with pickled cucumbers, avocado cream, and topped with habeñero kabayaki.  I also ordered the Jazz fries mentioned by some of my Yelp friends.  They are garlic fries topped with a brown gravy and then topped with what Fuku calls their crack sauce.  When you place your order they ask you for a nickname, not your first name.  They want to have some fun with people making up sometimes wild nicknames.  I was going to use what my mother used to call me but then I knew they wouldn't call that out.

I was a little lost.  I got a cup for my soda but I didn't see the fountain service anywhere.  Finally, I asked a woman going by and she helped me.  I got my diet and sat at the high top counter seats and waited.  My nickname was called and I received my tray with a big smile from the cook who prepared it and put it on the tray.

The burger was very good and the fries were even better.  They are like crack.  I could go back just for an order of them.  The burger was juicy, spicy, and the kabayaki crunch on top gave some nice texture to the burger.

One drawback for Fukuburger and FAME is that there are no bathrooms so there's no easy way to rinse your hands which you will NEED to do after finishing your burger.  Your fingers will be messy from the sauces.  I asked for some wet napkins like casinos provide but they had none.  I was directed to the bathrooms down the Linq promenade past the Ghirardelli Chocolate store.

That's where I went after I had dried my fingers as best as I could and I pushed doors open like I was keeping my hands sterile for surgery.  Be forewarned--take some casino wet naps with you to clean your fingers.  It's a curse of eating at Fukubruger but it's a good curse.

The sushi looked very dubious, so I stayed clear for the most part.  I did try some snapper nigiri, which wasn't very fresh tasting.

Service was fast and friendly, and empty trays at the buffet were promptly refilled as needed.

When I told the bar keep I was just having dessert, he gave me a menu and asked if he could get me something to drink.  Opting for ice water, I was soon given a large glass of very welcome coolness.

It's a good tasting cake with fine pineapple flavor.  I don't think there's anything particularly special about it.  It's good and I might get it again.

Nothing screams Las Vegas like a Cadillac convertible leading 20+ Elvi down Fremont Street to the area where a special stage had been set up.  It was a hoot.

Saturday nights are fun, too, because there are a number of men and women who dress up so you can get your photo taken with them for a tip.  Examples:  the band KISS, an Elvira-like, boot wearing lovely dresses in black with wonderful high heel black boots and a set of black wings.

I ordered the moo shu pork for an appetizer for the two of us and chicken with green beans for a main course, also to be shared.  The moo shu was brought out in a relatively quick time.  There were four plump pancakes filled with goodness.  It appears that Food Express used the tortilla like wrappers instead of the thinner, traditional pancakes.  The rolls were flavorful but before we even had one eaten, the server was back with our main course.  I hate that so much.

When the chicken arrived, it was not chicken with green beans but chicken with broccoli.  That was a language problem or simply an error on the server's part.  We took the meal.  I wouldn't waste that food for one vegetable.

When we were finished, I asked if there was a dessert menu.  The server mumbled something, pointed to the kitchen, and then left the table.  A few minutes later, he came back with two small bowls of warmed, sweetened red bean soup which was our dessert I guess but he never said anything more.

The line to get in was very long, but it moved along quickly.  You stop at the obligatory tourist photo area (I politely declined and I got through without having to pose for a goofy photo I wouldn't buy anyway).

Once to the podium in the theatre, an usher asked if I was alone.  When I answered yes, he said, ""Walk this way.""  No he really didn't but Marty Feldman did.  The usher took me to the front row by the stage stairs.  He took out a felt marker and initialed my ticket and told me to enjoy the show.  Score!  I stopped to see him on the way out.

The show began promptly at 9:30 and what followed was a 75 minute show that featured 4 impersonators of famous entertainers.  First up was Cher.  The woman who did this was very good, the best of the four this evening.  When she opened with Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves she had me from the get go.  Then Half Breed.  Hell, I was in heaven by now.  She not only sounded good, she looked the part, too!  There was audience participation on stage for one poor guy who was a good sport and had fun clowning and singing with her.  I'm glad I don't fit the stereotype she might be looking for to join her on stage.  Besides, I do my scowl well.  It's been practiced enough!

Next up was the Michael Jackson impersonator.  He was just OK.  His dance and body moves were much better than his vocal impersonation.  The two better numbers he did were Thriller and Billie Jean.  

Next up was the Tina Turner impersonator.  She was the weakest in the lineup last night.  I don't think she sounded like Turner at all.  She mangled Proud Mary as far as I was concerned.  I was glad when her numbers were over.

Last came Elvis.  I guess an impersonator show in Las Vegas wouldn't be complete without the King!  This guy was OK.  However, we have so many Elvis impersonators in Las Vegas that many of them would outshine this guy.  He did a credible job but he really had a baby face.  He redeemed himself somewhat in the finale when he did Viva Las Vegas.  How can I knock him too much?

The back up singers and dancers were good.  The choreography could be better.  It looks perfunctory at times,  The three dressed in showgirl outfits with head dresses for the Viva Las Vegas number were top notch.

Backing up the group was a 5 piece band that had a great sound.  They played well and it made the vocals better.

The shrimp was perfectly cooked, perched on top of a crispy breaded eggplant slice with a bright red tomato sauce. I also liked the bruschetta and the hummus, but there weren't enough pita triangles to go with the large amount of hummus we were served.

The sangria was a nice blend of fruity flavors and wine. We shared the lava cake and cheesecake for dessert. The cheesecake was smooth, rich, and creamy. The lava cake didn't have the molten center indicative of the dish, but it did taste good nonetheless.

We attempted to eat here on a Friday night, but it was packed to the gills, with several people waiting outside for a table to open up.  We decided to eat somewhere else, and come back again for lunch.

The lunch specials are a very good deal.  They come with a very good portion of main dish, with rice and soup.  Prices will range from $5-7 depending on what ""tier"" you order from.  I had #19, the ""Fish fillet with hot chili peppers).  Although I've had spicier and bolder tasting versions of this dish, this version wasn't so spicy that it left a weird aftertaste as I ate more, which I appreciated.  Also, the lowered heat level allowed more of the flavor of the spicy peppercorns and chilies to show through, and occasionally I'd get a hit of some fragrant whole peppercorn as I chewed.  The spicy bold broth was a good contrast to the delicate texture and mild flavor of the fish.  In addition to fish, there were bean sprouts and napa cabbage in the dish, with a sprig of cilantro on top.  The only slight negative, which is probably more of a syndrome regarding the dish itself rather than the kitchen's preparation, is that it is a very unctuous broth, layered with a copious amount of chili oil.

I also tried some ""Shredded pork with hot garlic onion"".  It was also a good portion, with tender pork and a salty, slightly pungent flavor.

Service was good, and drinks were refilled as needed.  It helps if you speak Mandarin here, and they do have specials on the wall, but they are written in Chinese.

I came here around opening time and got an order to go. Much of the interior seems to be similar to when it was Chino Bandido. They even have the giant stone panda! The menu is pretty simple and limited to, you guessed it, chicken and seafood : ) I decided on the spicy padak chicken ($17.99).

The order took maybe 15 minutes or so to make, and was packaged very well. The chicken came with a huge bag of sliced spring onions, spicy wasabi sauce, and 2 cartons of sweet pickled radish. The smell was heavenly as it wafted through my car driving home. 

Opening up the box, it was a sizable portion of chicken, definitely enough for 2 people, maybe 3. It consisted of chopped, bone-in pieces of white and dark meat chicken (Wings, thighs, drumsticks, breast). It was perfectly crispy with an even amount of sweet/spicy sauce on it. As instructed at the restaurant, I put the sliced onion on top of the chicken and poured the spicy wasabi sauce on top which added to the taste and texture. It was a very flavorful and strong tasting dish. Overall I enjoyed it, as the chicken pieces were well cooked. The sauce did tend to be slightly too sweet for me though.

They are currently running a 10% off special for their grand opening, so come on over and try some crazy fried chicken and crab!",14,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The chicken was decent- grilled and covered with a sweet and spicy sauce.  The crepe I had was the lobster and seafood crepes.  It was advertised as ""2 large crepes"" but when the dish came out, they looked puny against the big white plate that they were served in.  The crepe filling tasted just OK.  Nothing to write home about.  I couldn't really taste much lobster or shrimp (or notice any difference in texture) because it seemed like the main ingredient in the dish was the bright red ""Krab"" rather than ""crab"".  After the first crepe, I couldn't eat much more, there was something about the flavor and the sauce that really stopped me from wanting to eat the whole thing since it wasn't really that great tasting.  I tried some of the French au jus sandwich and it was also decent.  I wish the sandwich had more beef in it, for it looked like most of the sandwich consisted of toasted bread with just a thin slice or two of beef.

Dessert was interesting.  We had a warm brownie served with coffee ice cream and drizzled with caramel and pretzels.  I wouldn't have thought to use pretzels in a dessert, but the result was a pretty good mix of textures and tastes.

The crepe was decent, but the sauce was cold in the middle, and the veggies inside looked and tasted overcooked, which makes me suspect the crepe was made way ahead of time, then reheated in the oven. 

The soy latte was smooth and rich. It went well with the macarons, which were light, yet chewy with a hint of crispness.

Service was friendly, and my order was brought out to me quickly (Maybe because all they needed to do was reheat it).

This location is doing an ""Eat Like a High Roller"" promotion through the end of December.  It's $10 off when you spend $25 or more.  That's a good discount.

The steak and lobster is $13.99 and the soup added for $1.99.  That's a great value and everything was very good!

My wife ordered their sizzling chicken and cheese with a double side of broccoli.  She brought one of the chicken breasts home and she enjoyed her meal.

For dessert, I got a slice of red velvet cake with vanilla ice cream.  Total for the two of us after the $10 off was $35.  That included two iced teas.

There are four tables--two can seat up to 6 people and two can seat just two diners--making a maximum of 16 at any time.

The evening began with our server bringing drinks.  We all had iced tea save one who had bottled water.   Both green and black teas are served.

Course 1 -- Our Sakizuke or amuse-bouche was salmon roe and mushroom with grated daikon and ponzu sauce.

Course 2 -- Our Zensai consisted of sweet shrimp tartar, celeriac purée, and tomato sorbet.

Course 3 -- The Mushimono course was steamed scallop, mozzarella and grated turnip, and brown sauce.

Course 4 -- The Sashimi course consisted of varieties of fresh fish from Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo served in a large bowl.

Course 5 -- The Sumiyaki was overnight charcoal grilled white fish with truffle soy sauce and served on a round bed of rice.

Course 6 -- For Teppan, we had our choice of grilled wagyu or grilled Kobe (up charge of $80 for the Kobe).  The steak was served with roasted onion and wasabi mashed potatoes.

For dessert, we were brought a large round platter with various desserts including delicately peeled grapes to look like flower petals, mochi strawberries, blueberries, green tea tiramisu and other delights.

The meal was very good, paced nicely, and with the classic Japanese attention to detail in plating and choice of service dishes.  Some of the highlights for me were: the rice served with the white fish was absolutely delicious; the tomato sorbet with the sweet shrimp was another winner;  finally, the steak and wasabi potatoes were very good.

DDgv4aKw2fo_BUumhNtRmQ,1,2012-07-26,0,uDUgLkka74plsvLxx9tf_A,3,"This show is quite enjoyable but there are some problems with it.  One of them is the story, or lack thereof.  There is a small story that moves the action from one song to another but doing over 20 songs in an hour and 25 minutes doesn't leave much time for a plot.  

If you go to the show expecting you'll hear the Beach Boys, you will and you won't.  Some of the songs, duets for example, don't come across as sounding like the Beach Boys but that's OK.  Just don't expect all the songs to be like the originals.

I did like the projection of scenery onto the screens.  In the beginning I thought it was too busy, but after the opening, the videos added to the show.  My favorite scene was the one riding the ferris wheel on the pier.  It was a stunning visual!

The cast is a mixed bag.  In the beginning, I thought Brooke was a bit shrill but that changed as the show went along.  Some of Tanner's singing is just weak.  I wish they hadn't made the ""fat"" kid the nerd.  Why is that always done?

I think the price of the show is also a negative.  I expect tickets may show up in half priced venues.  If not, the show won't last long.  Last night's attendance was awful.  Probably less than 25% of the house was occupied.  That can't continue if the show is to survive.  Perhaps they have full houses on the weekend.

If you get a deal on tickets, I'd see the show.  I enjoyed it.  It's not a show I'd go back and see again like I have with most shows on the Las Vegas Strip.

One final recommendation, if you go, get the cheaper tickets.  The theatre isn't a huge one and you'll be able to take in the graphics on the screen and see all the dancing and other things quite well.  I sat in the front row behind the VIP section, and I thought it was just too close at times.

My server was Shawn and he was excellent.  He gave me the menu and then explained three of the night's specials.  After pondering for some time, I ordered lobster chowder, the 22 ounce ribeye steak special, and a twice baked potato.  

The chowder is a cream based soup with corn, potatoes, bacon, and some lobster meat placed in the center of the bowl.  Great cream soup with a lack of lobster you'd normally get with lobster bisque.  The steak was ordered black and blue and while it was fairly rare inside, it could have been a little less done. The twice baked potato--almost a throwback on menus today--was very good.  A huge baker that had been mashed, seasoned, and put back into the shell of the potato--some now cut away--and loaded with cheese.

Dessert was a let down.  First, there were only 5 things from which to choose and second the carrot cake I got was a bit dry.

I do like the room a lot.  There are no TVs, their bar is in the casino so the drinkers and noise makers are out there.  There is no door separating the room from the casino, but no sound from the casino could be heard.  I really liked having dinner without seeing a bar with multiple TVs--basically a sports bar-- and seeing people around the bar having happy hour small plates.  The room is nicely appointed.

Shawn was an excellent server.  He had good answers for my questions and he steered me correctly in deciding on some things to order.  A little work on the grilling and desserts and this would definitely be a four star steak house.

I ordered my burger rare and that's the way it came.  The Dillinger is topped with applewood bacon, cheddar, and brisket.  The burger was good but some of the flavor got lost with the brisket.  I guess I'm going to go back to being more of a purist when it comes to burgers.  Adding a lot of toppings to make your burgers different from other restaurants is getting a little carried away.  My wife's burger was cooked medium as she wanted and there was lettuce and tomato for on the burger or for eating as a side which was what I did.  No more on top with the Dillinger.

For dessert, we shared a peach bread pudding with some vanilla ice cream.  It was tasty but nothing special.

Who else can manage to cook a 5 star meal in a dorm room using a hot plate and a shower stall? I also admire his diverse interests- not many chefs can boast about being a DJ in their spare time!

Anyways, I was excited to try out his Burger Bar restaurant when we were in Vegas. We got here around opening time, and there was already a line forming to try out the delicious burgers. Although we had a large party, we were seated promptly. 

We decided to order the chicken wing appetizer, and I had a nutella shake to start out with. The chicken wings were good, but quite small compared to other chicken wings you'll find at other places. The nutella shake was beautifully presented, with elegant swirls of chocolate syrup laced on the inside of the cup. The shake itself was smooth, rich, chocolate indulgence, topped with chocolate whipped cream and a sprinkling of whole hazelnuts.

Although I didn't order the beer float paddle sampler, a person in our party did, and it looked amazing! (See pictures for the evidence!)

Although the Rossini burger was indeed tempting, I decided to forgo the $60 price tag and order the signature Hubert Keller burger ($22). After all, why not order the owner's favorite burger? It was perfectly cooked to order (Medium rare), with tender, flavorful buffalo meat, spinach, blue cheese, caramelized onions, with a lovely red wine sauce on the side. I'm not normally a fan of blue cheese, but it meshed well with the other ingredients. The only slight negative was that the burger really needed the red wine sauce on the burger, otherwise it tasted like it lacked a little seasoning. The fries that automatically came with the burger were decent, with a nice crisp outer layer.

Maybe if I strike it big in Vegas one of these days, I'll splurge on that $60 gilded lily of a burger, but for now I'll go for the other signature burgers!",5,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I added an extra 30 minute therapeutic massage as well to my spa day.  The massage therapist/wrap person did not introduce herself to me while being led to the room, and did not care to try with any friendly small-talk or banter.  In other words, just down to business, let's get this done.  The massage was first, and with all the knots in my shoulders and back, it wasn't realistically possible to work all of them out in 30 minutes, but it did help alleviate some of the tension in my shoulders.  

Onto the body treatment and wrap.  First, my arms and legs were brushed with a stiff bristle brush, which felt nice, but then made me feel kind of like I was a pony in a horse stall being groomed.  The pumpkin/oatmeal spice ""masque"" applied to the arms, legs, feet,and belly was more like an exfoliating lotion, but smelled really nice and soothing, and made my skin very soft.  I was disappointed that the ""foot dessert"" was no more than just a covering of more pumpkin spice masque with towel wrap.  Based on the description, I thought there would be some sort of massage, so my feet, while soft and exfoliated, still yearned for some promise of foot massage.  This type of body wrap involves no rinsing off, just rubbing off excess pumpkin mixture with the hot towels applied to your body.  

Would I go here again?  While I did like the wrap, I probably wouldn't pay full price for it since I feel like I get more therapeutic benefit from massages.  I might go here again to try another massage, but maybe from a friendlier masseuse.",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The Mesa restaurant is smaller than the Gilbert and Tempe locations but it is open later than the Tempe store (Seriously, who closes at 4 P.M. on a Saturday? Booooo). The menu is basically the same as the other locations, with your choice of base protein or vegetarian with your style of preparation (As tacos, a burrito, nachos, etc). 

I went with the vegetarian style rolled tacos. The tacos themselves are filled with mashed potato and if you get it vegetarian style you get rice, beans, and guacamole included with your meal. For toppings I had cheese, pico de gallo, onions, roasted corn, pickled red onion, white sauce and chipotle sauce. I also helped myself to some condiments from the salsa bar. 

The salsa bar had a few different types of salsa, fire roasted jalapenos, and lime wedges. Unlike the Gilbert location the salsas weren't labeled according to heat level. My favorite item from the salsa bar were those fire roasted jalapenos. They had a smokey deep flavor with plenty of spiciness.

The rolled tacos were an excellent combination of soft mashed potato center with crisp fried outer taco shell and I liked the beans, rice and toppings that it came with. It was such a hearty meal that I didn't miss the exclusion of protein at all.

Service was succinct but friendly.

I had a reservation for 5 PM and arrived about 3 minutes early.  I was seated in the section away from the far and closest to the casino.  The artwork of lucha libre wrestlers is quite different and it's colorful even if you don't know what it's about.

I was promptly brought the iced tea I ordered and I studied the menu for a minute or two.  My server, brittany--a delightful woman--came by and asked if I had any questions.  When I asked about the meatballs as an appetizer for one person, she explained that it would be fine.  She showed me the size of the meatballs using her fingers and I went with that.  I ordered the chicken machacados for my main course.

In a short time, a runner brought the meatballs.  As I was eating the second one, another runner came with my main course.  What is wrong with this picture?  I finished the meatballs and then enjoyed the chicken.  The chicken consisted of pounded, grilled chicken breasts with a tomatillo sauce and poblano chilis.  A very flavorful dish.

Lest one think that I was taking so many photos and spending too much time on my phone, here's the data.  I was seated just about 5 PM.  I was finished with my appetizer and main course at 5:23.  That's much too fast.  I don't want to wait a half hour for my food, but with a restaurant that wasn't full and had no waiting line, this was ridiculous.

For dessert--ordered separately after the dishes were cleared--I got the churro ice cream sandwich.  It was made with two pieces of churro with vanilla gelato in the middle.  There was a small container of melted chocolate which made the dessert richer.  It was quite good.

To put the time in context, I had from the above mentioned 5:23 until 5:45 when I left to order my dessert, pay the check, and leave.  There was more time with the last part of the meal than any other time.  It's a shame because the food is good and my server was good.

This is so close to being a 2 star review for the run on service with the appetizer and the main course.  If I come back, I'll order each course separately and space it myself.

Edit:  In my review, I forgot to mention the generous amount of complimentary salsa and chips brought shortly after you're seated in Libre.  I especially liked the wide nature of the bowl of salsa because it makes dipping a chips easy.  It's so much easier than small containers some places use.",22,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I had a ticket to see Zarkana so I went last night and ordered from the early dining menu which is a prix fixe 4 course meal.

I started with the corn egg drop soup.  It was standard fare.  Very tasty and a good starter.  Next came crisp fried beef roll with enoki mushroom and Mandarin brown sauce.  The rolls had a crisp exterior and very good tasting, moist beef inside.  The brown sauce was flavorful.  The main course has a choice option and I went with the beef tenderloin with portabella mushroom.  The beef was coated with black pepper and there was a small amount of black pepper sauce with the meat.  Accompanying the meat were stir fried bok choy and rice.  The meat was so very tender it could almost be cut with a fork only.  For dessert, there were two mochi--red bean and green tea.

Service was superb!  The servers knew I had a 7 PM show.  Since the restaurant opens at 5:30, time is an issue.  The courses were brought out in a timely manner with enough time between so not to feel rushed yet never was I tapping my foot nor looking at my watch.  They know what they're doing!

My server, Kenny, was very polite and pleasant.  The restaurant is quite elegant.  It was relatively quiet with modern music playing at a low, background volume which would be conducive to conversation.

The menu offers shredded chicken, beef, and pork, as well as steak and chicken strips in various forms such as burrito, taco, and salad. There are daily specials such as today's chicken tostada for a little less than $8. 

I had a shredded chicken burrito, XMas style (Green and red sauce) with rice, black beans, and pico de gallo. It was gigantic, barely fitting into the container it was in. Overall I enjoyed the meal. The medium green chile sauce was slightly sweet, contrasting with the more savory flavor of the hot red chile sauce. All the ingredients were cooked well, and the pico de gallo was a deep red and very refreshing with the burrito. I would have liked an additional texture in the burrito, maybe some diced onion in the mix though.

Service was very friendly and speedy. They have an app you can sign up for that tracks your purchases and gives you rewards after you reach a certain number of points.

I started the exhibit with the Last Supper video that shows the restoration done and how it was messed up by earlier restorations.  Then on to see many models of the weapons Da Vinci drew including the world's first armed tank.  Next came the fascinating section on the Mona Lisa, La Joconde.  The separate sets of photos of the yes, the hands, that smile--all of them made my understanding of this painting so much more than I ever imagined.

Finally, I went to the section on his flying machines and worked some of the ""please touch"" machines.  The exhibit ends with a sculpture of Da Vinci's--the only surviving sculpture of his.  It was made from a beeswax created by Da Vinci that has survived for about 500 years.

I had Max's on my bookmark list for some time. We decided to try them out for lunch on Sunday. We got there right at 1 when they opened and there were already a few orders placed for to-go meals. 

It took some time for someone to actually come to our table and hand us menus. When we got our orders in, we had more of a wait until another person came by to ask us what we wanted to drink. I ended up getting the MM09, listed as ""Yam, plantain, palaver sauce"" ($14.99). You have your choice of sweet/ripe plantain or more starchy/green plantain. 

Our dishes came out and they were a very generous portion. I was surprised to see a grilled fish on my plate since it wasn't listed on the ingredients for the platter but hey if they are throwing in a fish for my meal why not? The fish itself was tender and flaky on the outer portions with crisp skin but the center of the fish was still raw. The plantain and yam were very basic, whole chunks with no other seasoning. I did enjoy the palaver sauce, which was a chunky spinach based mixture. I also tried a bite of the goat stew which was rich and flavorful. The goat meat had a clean taste to it, not gamey at all. I also tried some fried rice which was decent, but the real star of the show was the amazing sauce it was served with. It had a spicy punch to it that I thoroughly enjoyed. 

I probably wouldn't eat here again to dine in due to the slow service. I might get a meal to go though. While everyone was very friendly, it took a long time to actually eat here due to all the waiting. If you prefer more of a laid back leisurely meal though this might be your place.

Initially, we went to Fatburger, but sadly, Fatburger is now an ex-Fatburger and out of business.

So, we drove down Mayfield on the way home, searching for a random place to get fries (and a burger to go with it).

""Hey, that place Tucky's says hot dogs, shakes, burgers... Wanna try it?""

Tucky's has a limited menu, with 6 different types of hot dogs, a few burgers, and shakes, but what they lack in diversity makes up for it in taste.  The shakes are made with custard, which gives them an extra depth of flavor.  The butterscotch shake I had was delicious.  I had a cheeseburger and chili cheese fries, both quite good.  They have an extensive condiment bar so you can customize your burger as you like it, and several different spices out as well so you can add any additional flavor you like.  

Our food came out fairly promptly after ordering, which is another plus.

The trail gives you freedom to ride with greater security than on the streets.  You still have to cross Hughes Park Drive, Sahara, and Charleston but when I ride on Sundays, these streets are generally quiet.

The trail north also is one of the best viewing areas for the annual July 4th fireworks at Red Rock Casino.  I ride over about 8:45 and then watch the show at 9.  The path is great for that.  Note:  Metro allows cars to jump the curb and park here for the fireworks so ride or walk there with care.

There is an odd curve to the trail at Hughes Park Drive.  The trail ends on he south side and you have to cross HP Drive and then head west on Hughes Park.  Then the trail starts again and does a little loop back until you're at the top of the small hill.  You're then on level ground and can ride to Charleston.

The trail north will soon be longer.  The city is extending the trail from Charleston Boulevard to Alexander Road using Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act funds.  This past weekend, Far Hills Avenue was closed for them to install the new bridge which will allow pedestrians and riders to go over Far Hills without stopping.  The path will go under Alta Drive.

Brenda decided to stop her random dilly dallying and thumb twiddling to hurry on over, take their orders right away and provide speedy service to them. Hmmm... Throughout our whole dining experience here she continued to chat with the other tables and pass by us but then act as if our table didn't even exist. I might be paranoid, but I get the sense she flat out refused to serve our table when we sat down and the bar server had to serve us instead. 

Anyways, I ordered the special for the day, the prime rib. I ordered it ""cowgirl size"" (About $19 I think) but they also had a bigger ""cowboy size"". When it came out it was a giant portion despite it being the smaller size, and a thick cut of meat. I requested it medium rare and it came out just as ordered. It was a great deal for less than $20. It wasn't the most tender prime rib I've had but hey what do you expect for such a great price. The sides I got were a baked potato and vegetables. The baked potato was good, it's hard to mess up a baked potato after all. The steamed vegetables tasted institutional, it looked like the kind of stuff you might get from the freezer section at the grocery store, and had a weird artificial butter taste to them. 

Overall the food is OK, and aside from the rude server that we were supposed to have, our actual server and the friendly server that brought our food to us provided us good service.

EDIT 10/18/16: The manager messaged me about my review and apologized for our experience saying there was a miscommunication about who was supposed to be serving our table. Upgrade to 3.5/5.",13,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

To get to the trailhead, take US 93 toward Hoover Dam and turn left into Lake Mead National Recreation Area where the Alan Bible Visitor Center is.  (The VC is currently closed for renovations).  Parking for the trail is on the right side of Lakeshore Road just past the Visitor Center entrance.  The trailhead is before any fee station if you come this way.

The tunnels were built in 1931 to carry all manner of things needed in the construction of Hoover Dam.  The hike is generally level for the tunnels, but if you go on to Hoover Dam, there are some ups and downs to do. 

When you come out of the fifth tunnel, you have three options.  Option 1 is to turn around and hike back to your car.  That will make a total distance of about 4.5 miles.  

Option 2 is to do a little exploring in this area.  The fifth tunnel is under the scenic overlook parking near the security checkpoint.  You could climb up the bank and enjoy the view.  There are no benches or tables, but you can sit on the rock wall.  

Option 3 is to continue on the trail which goes right to the parking garage at Hoover Dam.  Along the way, you can take an Option 3a.  That would be to cross the road going to the dam and enter the parking area of the O'Callaghan-Tillman Memorial Bridge.  From here, you can walk up the stairs to the bridge, walk the sidewalk across the bridge and back, and then hike back to the trailhead.  I have that trail with GPS coordinates on my EveryTrail page at http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=873657.  This would make a round trip distance of 8 miles.

Continuing to the dam and back without going to the new bridge would give you a total distance of about 7.5 miles.  

The nice thing about this trail is you can also ride it with your bike.  I've done the trail about 5 times hiking and 1 time with my bike and it's a great bike ride.

Check out the website in the listing to read some interesting history of the tunnels and their construction.

Happy hiking!",16,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Shortly after being seated, we were brought drinks and we took awhile to peruse the menu to agree on the items we all wanted to try.  We were brought a bread basket with ciabatta and focaccia.  We then ordered the following:

House made meatball with a fried stick of polenta and a rice ball
Imported Italian meats and cheeses
Spicy eggplant
Risotto with Italian arborio rice, tomato, ricotta cheese, black olive powder
Pesto gnocchi
Capellini puttanesca
Artichoke spaghetti with caviar and cinnamon
House made ravioli filled with spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella, light tear-drop tomato sauce
Tripe in spicy tomato sauce
Osso buco with farro
Farm raised rabbit with sautéed spinach
Flourless chocolate cake with chocolate mousse and strawberries
tiramisu

Noting we were sharing dishes, the house opted to serve our appetizers and initial four pastas on separate plates with a small serving of each.  The imported meat and cheese plate on the menu as affettati e formaggio was outstanding with a good selection of meats and cheeses.  Along with this, the off menu item, sliced eggplant was excellent.  

We then moved to the pastas.  The risotto was not cooked enough and was chewy.  The pesto gnocchi and house made ravioli with spinach, ricotta, mascarpone, and mortadella were the standouts.  The puttanesca was also good.  A fifth pasta was brought, an interesting and very tasty spaghetti with artichoke, caviar, cinnamon, and brown butter.  I never expected cinnamon and pasta to be together but it worker very well with the butter and caviar.

For the main course items, the peppery tripe and osso buco were excellent.  Their menu notes that the tripe is ""awesome"" which it is.

We finished with two desserts--a flourless chocolate cake and chocolate mousse with strawberries.  This was OK but we ordered one more dessert--tiramisu.  It was excellent.  Soft in texture and not overrun with alcohol, this was a perfect ending, along with a double espresso over ice--to a very delightful two and a half hour dinner with good friends.

Service was excellent during the meal.  The individual plating of some of our dishes made sharing easy but sometimes the food appeared lost on the very large plates.  During the second half of the meal, the servers opened the extenders on four sides of the round table so we had more room.",15,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
ecJri9ozyke4dOCWulZiRQ,14,2016-06-21,11,rAjZzNZ2_Rb0lsUysWkdNw,4,"Nishikawa (According to Google) means ""Western river"" in Japanese and is a family name in Japan. Nishikawa Ramen (According to me) means flavorful and delicious noodle soup! 

We came here on a Monday at 7 P.M. I saw on their website that they offered reservations so I contacted them for our reservation on Monday a few days before. When we arrived, I told the server that came to greet us that we had a reservation under my name. She gave me a blank stare and said ""OK. Reservation. I'll...be...right...back..."" Hm.... looks like someone forgot to write down our reservation... Or the server wasn't told about it...

It was fairly busy but there were a few tables still available and we were seated at a booth in a few minutes. The menu has pork based and chicken based broths, soba, and rice bowls. Appetizers include takoyaki, spicy squid, gyoza, and agedashi tofu. I went with the house black ramen and shared some takoyaki and spicy squid salad. 

The ramen came out first before the appetizers. The broth was flavorful and filling, and the entire bowl was filled with noodles, pork, bamboo shoots, nori, kikurage (Wood ear mushroom), fried onion, garlic chips, and green onion. I loved the pork. It was very tender and meltingly soft. It's a more fatty cut of meat so this isn't your meal if you're looking for something healthy. The egg was halfway between soft boiled and hard boiled, as the very center of the yolk was runny but the outer ring was solid. There is a condiment bowl at the table with chopped red chile that I tried with a scoop of broth. It added flavor but only a mild-medium amount of heat for me. The noodles were thicker as advertised, and had a good texture and elasticity. 

The squid came out around the same time the last ramen bowl arrived did and was lightly crisp from the fried battered coating. I enjoyed it with the spicy sauce. The takoyaki came out last, and was comped on our bill since it didn't come out sooner with the rest of our meals. The outer crisp coating was a great complement to the soft center and there was a good amount of octopus in each fritter. I would have liked a little more texture in the fritter other than batter and octopus but to each their own!

I also had an iced green tea which was excellent. It was very lightly sweet and refreshing.

Service could use some more work, but hey it's opening week I won't fault them too much for not getting service 100% right. In general all our servers were friendly. 

My friend initially wanted to take home an order of ramen but was told they don't offer the ramen to go because the quality of the takeout will be inferior to eating it there since the noodles will get overcooked. So, she decided to order a rice bowl (Tonkatsu donburi) and was told they would serve it in a bowl and they would give her a styrofoam container but they wouldn't actually deliver it to her in the styrofoam container. OK..... strange.

Overall we had an enjoyable experience here and while it's a little bit of a drive from where I live, I'll be back if I'm in the area or want to try something else out with some friends.

EDIT 6-22: Jay from the restaurant contacted me the day after our reservation and thanked me for coming (I think he's the head chef/owner?). He said he wanted to come out and say hi to our table but they got swamped with orders so he didn't get a chance to. They are doing some internal adjustments and retraining their servers based on what they've encountered during their soft opening so they are temporarily closing but will open back up again soon for those that are ravenous for ramen!",21,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
X9sDrd6Uia0uQFFKwwQcJg,1,2013-08-22,1,oA8rN8nfJdufgAl6An7-1Q,3,"No surprises here at this simple buffet. For $7.99 you can pig out on various vegetable dishes, chicken entrees, salad, and sweets like gulab jamun and carrot halwa.

The buffet was pretty basic. They had your standard dishes you'd see at an Indian buffet such as vegetable korma, chicken tikka masala, a saag (spinach) dish, and some dark meat tandoori chicken. They also had a tray of chicken vindaloo, a bright red dish with spicy heat! 

Unfortunately, the dishes were lacking in that certain ""punch"" that makes Indian food, when done right, so remarkable. The vegetable korma was a little runny in consistency, and seemed to consist mainly of potatoes and not much else. Same could be said for the vindaloo. I couldn't really find any pieces of chicken in it, just potato. The chicken tikka masala was OK, but nothing really too impressive. There was also a tray of veggie pakora and basmati rice. I enjoyed the veggie pakora the most out of all the savory dishes. There were a lot of veggies packed into the fritter, fried until tender with a tasty batter. I also enjoyed the fresh garlic naan brought to the table. 

There was also a salad area, condiments such as raita and chutney, and some dessert. Out of the two desserts (carrot halwa and gulab jamun), I liked the gulab jamun the most. It had that nice tender cake-like texture that the dish typically has, soaked in some sweet syrup.

Soda fountain drinks are $1.99 and consist of coke products.

The buffet for lunch is from Monday through Friday. The saving grace of the meal was the price point. Since it was just $7.99, I wasn't too disappointed that my meal consisted of mainly potatoes in various curries, rather than a multitude of various meats and veggies.",4,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
OETh78qcgDltvHULowwhJg,3,2013-08-29,2,avF_Sc1FSv0uHvC9AR0Eww,5,"I got a dinner/show package for Gordon Ramsay Steak and Jersey Boys at a discounted locals' price.  Last night was the night and both were excellent!  I am one of those people who dislikes the public persona of Gordon Ramsay.  I'm not sure I would have come here last night but it was one of the food options and I grabbed for the ring and I got the gold one.

I had a few choices from their menu for each course but it was easy for me to order.  For an appetizer, the British ale onion soup.  For the main course, I chose the 24 ounce bone in rib eye.  And for dessert I ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  I did not order a side, an extra charge, since I would be eating approximately a pound of beef alone.  

I had a reservation for 5 PM and arrived shortly before.  A hostess asked me to wait in the lounge area and assured me I'd be shown to my table soon and I was.  Another hostess asked me if I wanted to walk the stairs or take the elevator.  The stairs it was.  She seated me at a small table along the railing which gave me a nice view of the downstairs dining area and a  view of the ceiling with the Union Jack and the neon sculpture.  Coming up the stairs, she explained that the neon was an artist's conception of the movement Ramsay's hands make when he's creating a beef Wellington.  It is very interesting very different.

Richard, one of my servers, brought me their drink iPad.  I politely passed and went with an iced tea.  They only serve bottled iced tea, Republic of Tea, and I was given a choice of three flavors.  The blackberry sage was my choice, a tea I often make at home.  

I gave Richard my voucher for dinner and a few moments later, he brought the Ramsay menu and told me my choices for each of the courses.  I ordered the soup and steak first and waited until later to order dessert.

Some bread was brought to my table and the selection was so different than normal.  There were two lemon thyme focaccia squares, one mushroom truffle mini brioche, a pancetta fig mini brioche, and two slices of Stilton walnut baguette.  On the side of the bread plate was a round of English Devonshire butter with Hawaiian volcanic sea salt sprinkled on top.  Yes!  A restaurant that doesn't hide the salt from you.  I did observe a woman at the next table trying to get some butter without getting a single salt crystal so I understand both sides.  The bread was excellent.  I had one slice of the baguette and one mini brioche--the mushroom truffle.  I knew there was a large steak coming and I wanted to leave room.

The onion soup was excellent.  I had some of that soup at Ramsay's Pub at Caesars so I knew what to expect.  Rich broth, tasty caramelized onions, and the two slices of Welsh rarebit on top made for a very good start.

Then a runner brought my steak and it was indeed huge!  It had a Demi-glace with mustard seeds.  The steak was done extra rare as I requested.  It was marbled very nicely and it was very tender.  I sat their thinking I must be some kind of glutton as I kept eating and eating until I was almost completely to the bone.  At home, I would have gnawed on it like a dog, but I let my better manners take over last night.  After bringing me the steak, Carlos, my other server, asked if I wanted any salt or pepper.  He appeared a but later with a plate with two containers--one with ground pepper and the other with sea salt!  A second Yes!

Later, I ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  I also had this at Caesars. I wanted to compare it to some STP I had the week before at another steakhouse on the Strip.  There is no comparison.  Ramsay's version wins hands down.  It's a moist pudding cake served with toffee in a metal pourer and a stick of brown butter ice cream.  Delicious!

A note on service.  Richard and Carlos were first rate!  They were polite and friendly.  An above and beyond kind of thing happened when I asked Carlos about the types of bread.  He went to the kitchen, got a sheet of paper, and wrote out what they served.  That was really nice of him and it helped me remember the different things on the plate.  At the end of dinner, Richard gave me a business card with their two names on it and I'll keep it for the future because I will be back.  I have to try some more things on the menu.

By the way, Mr. Ramsay, I may change my thoughts about you a bit.  I understand that you're public persona is somewhat of a show for TV and that you're much different--read nicer--when not before the cameras in Hell's Kitchen!",6,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

It's been probably over 10 years since I ate here once as a tourist.  As I was driving by, heading to a familiar place, I decided to give it a go and try something different.  I was glad I did.  It's standard Tex/Mex.  The food could use a little more spice, but I assume they are directing their seasoning toward the people who want the Tex/Mex flavor without any zing.

Chips and salsa were completely average.  The salsa tasted like it came from a bottle of Pace salsa - nothing special there.  For the entree, I had the Pork Rostistado with ""spicy verde sauce"" or so the menu says.  The meal came with rice, black beans with some cheese sprinkled on the beans, and some great sauteed vegetables - zucchini and carrots - and the standard container of tortillas. As for the ""spicy verde sauce,"" well it wasn't spicy.  The plain black beans had more zing than the verde sauce.  I asked my server for some Cholula and the dish took on a spicier flavor, more the way I like it.  The pork was very tasty, and in all, it was a good meal.

Of course, going to a different place means you have to try dessert just to see if the place is on the up and up.  I got their Banana Napoleon that was highly recommended by my server.  It was layers of banana pudding, sweetened, fried tortilla squares, and fresh bananas and whipped cream. She was right.  It was superb, but way too big!  OK, I made the sacrifice and finished it so there was no waste of food from me.

Service was excellent.  My server was a delightful young woman, very attentive, and she brought me refills of my iced tea promptly and without me having to request it.

They explained that the regular was a double patty so I ordered the ""little"" bacon cheeseburger.  I got my burger with lettuce, jalapeños, and grilled mushrooms.
The people I was with took care of ordering two medium fries for the five of us and that was plenty.

The burger was a nondescript piece of cooked, ground beef.   There was one half of a piece of lettuce that was only partly on the patty.  There were no mushrooms that I could see anywhere.  The bacon was crumbled pieces of bacon on the bottom bun under the burger, not the more common bacon slices you'd get at most places.

The fries were good. I liked the amount of salt they used.  Had I been ordering for myself, I would have ordered cajun fries but alas I wasn't.

The fact that they have free peanuts to snack on before the burger comes or after or to take a bag home with you didn't phase me at all.  I think I had three peanuts and that was good enough.

The place doesn't deserve a 2 star rating but I really hate to round it to three.  The fries will push it to a three.  Let's just say it's not a place to which I'd return!  Also, the music was BLARING!  It was awful!!!",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

When added up, the cost from the menu was $2 less if you ordered à la carte than the price they charged for their RW menu.  Their $4 contribution per RW order then is half paid by the customer.  Tacky, but it's OK.  It was not OK to be on the RW page for weeks and not yet have any menus available.  Instead, I was brought a tablet with the menu from the HelpOutDineOut website.  

For the three courses, I ordered the charred shishito peppers, the forbidden black rice, and the funkler.  There was one other party in the restaurant when I got there at 5 and it took ten minutes to find out they had no RW menus, show me the tablet, order, and get an iced tea.

The food was hit and miss.  I liked the shishito peppers.  Charred very nicely, they were quite flavorful and as with most peppers, they varied with their heat.  The accompanying aioli really didn't have much flavor.  I think it was there to help cool some patrons' palates who might find the peppers too spicy.  Next came the forbidden black rice.  It was a nice mixture with the star being the kobacha squash.  I could discern none of the promised mint, cilantro, or Thai basil.  I was about 2/3 of the way through my rice when a server committed what I consider the ultimate serving error.  My dessert, the funkler--a  warm blondie with ice cream--was placed on the bar next to my bowl of unfinished rice.  Didn't anyone watch to see when I was done or did someone just decide to send out dessert when they decided it was the right time.

At that point, I raised the bowl of rice, tipped it toward me, and started pushing the rice from the bowl with my chopsticks.  I should have told him to take it back becasue I wasn't ready but I opted to finish and cut my losses.

The blondie was poor.  It was very hard and very dry.  I had to push very firmly with my fork to break through the blondie.  I should have let the ice cream melt over it and soften it a bit.  I don't know how long it had been sitting around but it was obviously too long.  What a disappointment--in service and execution.

During my meal, I was asked if I wanted more iced tea.  After 5 minutes, the person looked over and snapped his finger as he realized he'd forgotten the tea.  This was indicative of the service during my visit.  No one seemed to know what they were doing.  The dessert error, though, was the most fundamental error any restaurant can commit.  It just should never be done!   Lucky Foo's needs to address their service issues.  They are not training their people or they just don't care.

I paid my bill and left, sorry that I had chosen Lucky Foo's to begin my Restaurant Week dinners.  What a disappointment!!",17,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

She was right, but she never knew about Sweet Addiction.  My mid-day meal was an ice cream sandwich made with two fresh cookies and a nice amount of ice cream.  It makes absolute nutritional sense to me!

On entering the store, I'm sure I had that ""deer in the headlights"" look.  One of the staff  immediately asked me if it was my first time there.  Answering in the affirmative, she explained what they sell and how it's served.  She was wonderful, and I felt like a long time valued customer almost from the get go.  That's good customer service for a place that's only been opened two weeks.

After the explanation, I ordered a cookie sandwich with chocolate malted crunch ice cream.  I opted to get two of the same cookies rather than mix.  I need to save that option for my next visit.  I chose the chocolate brownie cookie.  These cookies are marvelous.  It's a soft brownie in the shape of a cookie with a rich, chocolatey taste.  

The cookie sandwich is served in a styrofoam bowl, so if you're a drip like me, they go into the bowl and not on the table or your napkin or worse--your pants.  Even so, I still had chocolate fingers and I probably had some chocolate in my beard.  They have bathrooms so you can wash off the excess you can't lick off--well not politely anyway.

I spoke with the owner about hiking and his beginning mountain biking and I felt like I was talking with people I already knew.  It's a very comfortable, easy place to go.  And, it certainly is addictive.  I may have to switch now and then the Wallyworld I go to so as not to be tempted to make this a weekly stop.  I'll have to hike extra this week to work off this nutritious mid-day meal.  Thanks, mom!  And, thanks to the Yelpers that discovered this place and let me in on it.  I'm glad they didn't keep it a secret.

Happy mountain biking and hiking (for the ladies of the store)!",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
mh9_KtSt_ebl7vTKiy2vQw,5,2013-05-22,1,NVDhvNafTNBfL7UQC_yAYg,5,"I did my first rock art recording for the Nevada Rock Art Association at Sloan Canyon in 2006.  It was my second and third times there but I haven't been back until I went yesterday, 21 May 2013.  This is a stellar place to see history with all of the petroglyphs left by the Indians.  The rock art consists of about 1,700 figures on 300 panels and they are everywhere when you get into the canyon.

First, Sloan is not a place to go alone.  Cell phone coverage does not exist for a good part of the hike.  It's about 1 mile from where you park to get to what's called Petroglyph Canyon at Sloan.  This one mile consists of walking up a gravel wash and climbing up or going around 4 dry waterfalls.  Of course, if there's a chance of rain, stay out.  This would be a bad place to get caught in a monsoon downpour.  The last dry fall is the one of most concern.  There's a chockstone blocking the way, but you can climb up a slippery rock slope to the left.  Better yet, backtrack to the top of dry fall two and climb the rocks steps to the top of the ridge.  This will get you past the chockstone and will be a safer route.

From here, explore both sides of the canyon both higher up and along the wash.  There are rock art panels everywhere. Some of the figures are easy to understand.  You look at a drawing of a bighorn and that's what it is.  Other figures are more geometrical and there's no one who can tell you with any accuracy what they represent.  When I was trained by the Executive Director of NRAF, she said whatever they look to you, that's what they are!

With some money the Conservation Area got from the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act, the Bureau of Land Management has been increasing the number of trails for hiking throughout the Sloan Canyon NCA.  Here, there are three trails.  Route 100 comes from where you park and goes to the turnoff to trails 200 and 300.  200 is the Cowboy Trail and 300 goes to Hidden Valley.

As with any desert hiking, bring plenty of water and wear hiking boots for climbing the fry falls.  Also, here and everywhere, respect the land and our history and don't vandalize the rock art.  Part of the reason I was there yesterday with a team from BLM was to try to remove scratches someone has made on some of the rock art and we were trying to restore it.  Be considerate of Nevada's past!!  Enjoy the art by photographing it.  Don't touch the rock art, trace over it with a paper, or use chalk or anything else to deface it.  Oh, and, go and enjoy!  This place is a treasure.

Last thoughts, you do need a high clearance vehicle to get here.  4 wheel drive is not necessary.  Check the BLM website for Sloan to get directions.",8,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
OY0-hYJ2q6WiAqhYnCZZ0w,14,2016-03-31,11,b_WCfrZCkqEY4fNSfbZ8vg,4,"As we headed to this restaurant the tune from the '80s song ""Our House"" by Madness floated through my head but with the lyrics below:

Brat Haus...
In the middle of 2nd St.
Brat Haus...

(OK so it's actually south of 2nd St. on Scottsdale Rd. but my brain likes to take creative license on reality, especially when directions are involved).

Quite honestly Brat Haus wasn't our first choice. We were going to go to Rehab Burger but there was a 45 min to 1 hour wait to get a table. Whaaaat? On a Wednesday night? At 6 P.M.? Then I realized it was Spring Training time which made a lot more sense. 

Anyways, Brat Haus, despite being our little silver medal of restaurants, ended up being a wonderful choice for dinner. There was no wait and we were seated quickly. We shared some appetizers and I ordered the Das Fire, their spiciest sausage on the menu, in sandwich form.

Our appetizers were a large portion and excellent. The pretzel ($6) was perfectly cooked with a well balanced beer-cheese dip. The poutine ($12) was a huge plate of fries soaked in thick brown gravy with battered and fried cheese curds and pork belly. Salty, fatty, starchy Canadian inspired goodness, eh?

My Das Fire sausage ($10) had a mixture of habanero, green chile, and jalapeño in it. Our server warned me it was spicy but I said I was up for the challenge! It was a medium-hot level of spiciness for me, almost spicy enough to make my nose run but not quite. I got it with the root beer onions ($1 extra) which were very potent and strong flavored against the savory, fiery flavor of the sausage. I appreciated the huge mound of onions with it, but I probably would have preferred a mix of root beer onion with another condiment to balance out the flavor a little more (Now I know for next time). The only slight negative for me was that the casing didn't have a good ""snap"" to it when I bit into it, so with some bites I really had to work my teeth into the sausage to tear off a chunk with the sandwich bread.

Service was good and drinks were refilled as needed.

While we ate inside today since it was getting chilly, I'd definitely like to come here again to dine at their dog friendly patio and perhaps order a special dog brat for my four legged friends.",17,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I prefer this events center to the MGM Grand Garden because it's a bit more manageable in size which makes parking and leaving a bit easier.  There are plenty of concession areas and bathrooms.  The center is always kept clean.

I have one problem with them and it's a problem with them and TicketMaster.  I had my electronic ticket on my iPhone but the woman scanning tickets in the line I was in didn't have the ability to scan the phone.  Come on--work with your partner TicketMaster.  This is 2014.  Get with it.  

The leg room is awful and the stairs going down the rows has different sizes.  As it turned out, the woman in front of me slipped and as I went to grab her from falling, we ended up sort of groping each other.  That ought to be worth a star of its own.

A lot of other people had the same idea as we did and when we arrived around 11:30 there was about a 15 minute wait which wasn't too bad since there are several benches people can use to sit and chill. It also gave us time to browse through the menu and pick out our food.

I got my old standby, the half and half: 2 normal sized protein pancakes (Versus the flying saucer sized ones that come with a full order) and a skillet of your choice. My favorite skillet is the chicken bacon because of the mixture of ingredients and flavors. It was served with one egg (Ordered poached today). It was made very quickly, especially considering the high volume of customers in the restaurant today, and tasted great. The protein pancakes were slightly crispy with a hearty mixture of batter, oats, a touch of cinnamon, and blueberries. A full mound of butter and some thick maple syrup were the accompaniments. The skillet was equally as pleasing, with a filling amount of chicken, bacon, potatoes, and melted cheese. The only slight negative was that there was a very slim amount of paste-like avocado mixture on the skillet. In other versions I've had they normally give you a few slices of avocado.

Service was decent considering there were so many people eating here today, and I appreciated that the server left us a whole pitcher of iced tea and a whole carafe of coffee so we could serve our own refills. 

The actual atmosphere of the restaurant is similar to the Tempe location, except the Chandler restaurant seems to be able to seat more people.

I was going out for dinner last night and she didn't want the food I was going to be having so I had to provide something for her.  After giving several choices, she opted for Arby's whose Market Fresh sandwiches she liked in the past.

I drove down and got a turkey ranch with bacon Fresh Market sandwich and an order of curly fries.  I was home in no time at all.  When I got in late last night, she elated how good her dinner was.  She liked the sandwich and the fries were something that haven't been in the house for years.

Now from my perspective, service was just OK.  The counter critter who took my order was lethargic and that's being kind.  After taking my order, she went about filling some others and motioned to me when my order was ready.  There was only one person in the restaurant besides me and only two cars at the drive through.

We went on a Wednesday, where it was all day happy hour and caipirinhas were $3.50.  Cheap, but you get what you pay for.  They use 51 cachaca here, which is more easily found in the U.S., but not really the smoothest cachaca out there.  As a result, the alcohol drowned out the overall flavor of the drink.

As for the food, just so-so.  They had a wide selection of seafood at the buffet, such as mussels, bay scallops, snow crab legs, calamari salad, but all were slightly sub-par (either too tough, too bland, etc).  They had a pot of feijoada (i.e., black bean soup), but there was something lacking in the stew (maybe it needed more smokey flavor?).  When we were ready for our parade of meats, they ended up bringing out probably 10-11 of the 14 advertised meats/skewers at our table.  We waited somewhat patiently for them to bring out the other meats we hadn't tried before (such as lamb, ribs), but it seems like they weren't going to be serving those more expensive meats today.  The meats themselves ranged from slightly dry (chicken), to juicy and tender (beef skewers and the ham).  All the meats were simply seasoned with salt which tended to get overwhelming after eating so much salty meat.  Strangely enough, my favorite skewer was actually not meat related at all.

I got 6 potato and cheese but I got them boiled--evidently the default--instead of fried.  I added the caramelized onion for a topping.  Since I also got two of the paczki to take home, the woman who waited on my gave me a cup for some free coffee from the counter near the entrance.  I enjoyed the coffee while I waited for the pierogis.

Mentally, I did a double take when I got the dumplings because of my forgetfulness.  I took a taste of one and it was rather bland.  A little salt helped the situation.  I am also not used to having pierogi made with farmers cheese instead of a more flavorful cheese.  Frying them might have made the cheese taste more, but the potato/cheese pierogi were just OK.  The dough was OK.  I appreciated the thinness of it instead of the clunky thickness of some frozen varieties.

Perhaps they had too high a standard to meet because my mother-in-law used to make the pierogis for the family.  It was her homemade pierogi that I had in mind and to that comparison, these were disappointing.  I think I get pretty much the same quality pierogi buying frozen ones available in a specialty grocery and baking them with onions and butter.

On the other hand, the two paczki were flavorful.  They are only gotten in for a short period of time before Lent--specifically some Polish friends refer to Fat Tuesday as Paczki Day.

I know pierogi are available with a number of fillings but I am more a traditionalist and go for just the potato and cheese although my mother-in-law also made sauerkraut filled pierogi which I tried once and then ignored from then on.",11,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

This time I ordered the chef's tasting menu which is a five course dinner featuring ""the best of the best signature dishes"" from Chef Katsuya Uechi.  That's a quote from the menu.

Course 1 was an appetizer sampling.  There were four items--creamy rock shrimp, yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, crispy rice with spicy tuna, and spicy albacore sashimi with crispy onion.  The spicy albacore was hands down the best of the four but they were all good.

Course 2 was a ceviche of sashimi with yuzu and lime.  Very refreshing, served with a spoon, but I found it difficult to eat with a spoon so I used my chopsticks.  Much easier!  I believe this was meant to be the first course but it didn't matter.  It was small but very tasty.

Course 3 was miso marinated black cod.  The fish was superb.  Soft, moist, and very flavorful.  It was almost impossible to pick up using chopsticks but I managed to do it. 

Course 4 was the sushi course.  There were 5 pieces of nigiri style sushi.  Pretty standard.  Nothing exceptional but good.

Course 5 was dessert and I asked my server about two potential choices from the ones they serve.  He recommended the Yuzu tart and it was perfect.  A very pleasant, light dessert and a super way to finish this meal.

The restaurant was quite busy and alive tonight.  My server, Ken, was spot on with everything he described.  His knowledge of the menu was exactly what I needed in deciding to do the tasting menu or to order à la carte.  He was efficient, polite, and pleasant.

I had just enough time before the Jacksons' show to have an ice cream sandwich.  When I asked the young thing behind the counter what flavors they had, she explained you pick any two cookies you want and any of their ice creams.

I chose a Snickerdoodle and a s'mores cookie and the ice cream I chose was cookie dough.  That's one from each of my 3 food groups.  She placed one cookie on a wooden thing, put a large scoop of ice cream on the cookie, pushed it down to even out the filling, and then she placed the other cookie on top.

She placed the ice cream sandwich in a cardboard ice cream cup and placed a spoon in the cup with the cookies and ice cream.

The dessert is a bit pricey and sitting on a cushioned bench in the Miracle Mile Shops is not a classy eating experience.  I knew that in advance so that's OK.  The ice cream and the cookies were good .",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The sandwiches were OK.  Nothing exceptional nor were they less than anywhere else.  The fries were not salted after frying and they were dry and didn't hold salt once we got them.  Aside from that, it is a fast food court with a pizza shop and the staff went between the two as needed.  You place your order, are given a buzzer, and you get your tray when the buzzer goes off.

The sandwiches are overpriced.  Perhaps they're covering themselves from people who take advantage of the unlimited fries.  The service was slow.  There was one person ahead of us and we waited about 5 minutes for fast food.  Not good.  In addition, there are no plastic forks or knives available without asking.

The interior is casual with lots of Philly memorabilia and you can hear the tell-tale metallic sounds of thinly sliced steak being cooked and chopped up on a griddle.

The menu is limited to Philly steaks and hoagies with fries or chips as sides. You have your choice of 6"" or 12"". We shared a 12"" mushroom pepper cheesesteak and seasoned fries. 

The cheesesteak had tender meat and was a good filling portion with the soft bread. The peppers were a mix of various colored bell peppers and there were a few mushrooms in it. I couldn't really taste the mushrooms too much but I did like the crunch of the peppers with the soft textures of the meat, cheese and bread. If they had an option for hot peppers I would have gotten those with the sandwich as well. The cheese was ooey-gooey, well meshed within the meat.

The fries were a mix of wedges and long cut potatoes. The exterior was nicely seasoned and lightly crisp, with a soft fluffy textured interior. 

The one thing I did notice about this cheesesteak that set it apart from cheesesteaks I've enjoyed in Philly is that the meat was more dry in the sandwich. This might sound weird but it was almost too clean of an eating experience. Usually when I've had a spectacular Philly the meat is very juicy and the cheese free flowing which creates an abominable mess running down your arms and soaking your hands thoroughly. Now am I saying I like wet or soggy sandwiches? No! I like a little more moisture in my filling, that's all. I do appreciate that this style of Philly cheesesteak is easier on your laundry bill though. 

We came here around 7ish and when we finished around 7:30 they had run out of bread and could not serve any more sandwiches, so get here as early as you can to prevent potential Philly cheesesteak heartbreak!

We placed our order of a burger, enchilada combo plate, and cheese quesadilla, and dug into the chips and salsa.

When we arrived, the ordering area was backed up a little.  There;s a choke point at the register when they're busy.  This will be interesting when it's in the 100s outside and people are waiting out the entrance.  There's a large menu on the left.  Some reviews have noted this and how awkward it is.  There are now paper menus available at the counter before you reach the terminals.

We met Mona who expedited our ordering and then sat with us at the table we chose on the patio.  After the order is taken, you get a metal pail with a number on it that lets the runner know where to deliver food.  The pail has two sauces, salt and pepper, some utensils, and some napkins--one for each person.

We ordered a lamb slab, an original burger with cheese, pork bullets with fries and coleslaw, onion strings, and three kid friendly milk shakes--maple bacon doughnut, birthday cake, and pecan banana split.

While waiting for our food, Mona explained the concept of R&B and one could sense her excitement and pleasure at bringing this Australian concept to the US, specifically in Downtown Summerlin where it was halfway between the fast food places at the south side of the mall and the high end places to the north.

My favorite of the meal was the lamb slab.  Good tasting meat with some good flavor from the marinade.  Since I didn't do the ordering, I'm not sure if burgers can be gotten at different temperatures.  Our burger was done well.  I would have had blood running down my chin.  The burger was OK but I didn't get the special nature of the flavors as described by Mona the way R&B constructed their burgers.  It was a burger.The menu notes their ""Famous R&B fries.""  There was nothing that would make these fries famous.  The fact that most of them went back when our dishes were cleared was testimony to how we both felt.

The 3 kid friendly shakes were hit and miss--mostly miss.  The birthday cake sprinkles clogged the straw so sipping it was almost impossible.  The maple bacon doughnut was just lacking in flavor but the banana split was a really good shake.

As for service, there were a number of servers always circling about but when we asked for more napkins, we did not get them.  A trip inside to the sink to wash up was necessary.  

We did ask for some ice water and we were brought glasses with ice water.  I did see some others with paper cups so I'm not sure if we were treated differently.

We shared the pork belly with garlic sauce (#17), water boiled chicken (#25), spinach with garlic sauce (#66), and dumplings with chili oil (#76).

The pork belly was tender and was well seasoned. The sauce it was in complimented it well. The water boiled chicken was excellent, with a depth of flavor from the tongue numbing peppercorns and chiles. The spinach was a sizable portion, with more of a delicate flavor to contrast with all the bold, spicy dishes. The dumplings in chili oil had a meltingly soft dough with a good amount of filling and I loved the kick of spicy oil with them.

I purchased a Groupon and waited for the right day to use it to revel in all that is Chuck Jones.  The trouble is, there's not a lot to revel in.

I thought the most interesting part of the exhibit was the video playing as you enter.  It was very interesting looking at the Type A personality of Jones as he drew many of the characters in the poses he wanted them in and then saw some of them come to life.  Interviewing people who worked with Jones was interesting too.  It was a way of learning how the background artist did his job and the parameters he had to observe that Jones set.  After about 15 minutes of watching the video, the benches start to get really hard and you have the need to get up and walk around.

It's a small area with many frames of cartoons that Jones drew.  I felt the descriptions of things could have been better done.  Many of the plates were small with 10 point or so lettering and they were not at all helpful at times.

I was so glad to look at the Restaurant Week list and see Comme Ça listed.  I've wanted to try this place for a long time now and this made a perfect time to do it.

I went with the 5 course RW menu with the supplemental pan roast of foie gras for an extra charge of $19.

Bread was brought out quickly after we ordered and the thick bread sticks were very hot!!!

Course 1 - I chose the warm asparagus salad.  The salad was a surprise.  On the bottom was the warm asparagus spears.  They were topped with mixed greens and the black truffle salumi was sprinkled on top.  To the side was a poached egg with Hollandaise.  It was an interesting and flavorful way to make a salad.

Course 2 - I got the roasted bone marrow with oxtail jam.  What delicious food and what a lot to eat!  The roasted bone had some coarsely ground salt on the side and the oxtail jam was a large serving of meat with some greens on top and slices of small toasted bread around the edge of the ramekin that held the jam. 

Course - 3 The supplemental roast of foie gras with vanilla bread pudding, foie gras and a goie gras ""cherry bomb"" was next.  The roasted foie gras was on the vanilla bread pudding and the ""cherry bomb"" was another piece of foie gras with a glacé colored red and a cherry pit coming from the ""cherry bomb.""  Very tasty and a nice play on the firework.

Course 4 - Parisian gnocchi with braised lamb neck and goat cheese with some fava beans.  It was good.

Course 5 - Peach pie with almond streusel and rum raisin ice cream.

The whole meal was very nice and quite interesting the way the chef planned the food and its presentation. One of the things that stood out were the rich sauces with the food.  There was a lot of effort into getting those tasty sauces with the courses. The items on the RW menu are available from the everyday summer menu but I doubt I would have ordered them as separates if they hadn't been packaged like this for Restaurant Week.

Our server, Sabrina, was a very pleasant woman.  She looked after our table.  It wasn't too hard as last night was a very sparse night even when we left around 7 PM.  It seemed like all the restaurants at that section of the Cosmopolitan were low on customers.

The kitchen seemed slow.  It took almost 2 hours for this meal, something I'd expect from a multi-course meal at a restaurant when I'm doing a tasting menu of this or more courses.  The wait sometimes was welcomed but then grew too long at other times.

The views out the windows toward Planet Hollywood and Paris were great!  What more could you want except to be sitting at an outside table.  A nice way to finish Restaurant Week with a meal here and then ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" at a community theatre a few miles from there.

Addendum:  My wife, who's very food challenged and resists trying anything new, ordered the Comme Ça burger, a large burger with cheddar cheese and slaw and a HUGE order of French fries.  She liked it very much and even took a small taste of my bone marrow!  Score one for change!  Sabrina asked when we wanted her burger brought so she wasn't sitting there already long done waiting for me to finish.  She got her burger at my foie gras course and it worked perfectly!",5,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

MNGnvV-P6K1SGMZzhPWPjw,4,2012-07-21,2,Zj61plDaKTJOnqD10zH2Ww,4,"Review is for summer lift program and restaurant only:

6 of us drove here today to ride the chairlift to the top and then hike back to the lodge.  For $10, you can ride the lift and walk, or stay there for awhile and then ride back, or make a round trip ride.

We hiked above the end of the lift area and enjoyed the beauty of the limestone mountains of Lee Canyon at Mount Charleston.  While walking, we noticed an elk below and we made plans to walk quietly down and through the trees to get a better look.  It was great fun and what a beauty.  He had a large rack and was not too bothered to have us stalking him.

After our walk back, we had lunch.  The Bighorn Grill is closed for major renovations so we sat on the patio and had burgers or salads.  Service was very good.  They had no iced tea and they don't serve Coke--egads, what to do?  Our server was very friendly and competent and she had a great sense of humor especially when I kidded her about being 0 for 2 when she told us no iced tea, no Coke.

The woman at the lodge who sold us the lift ticket was very pleasant.  She answered my questions about elevations and when the lift would be open.

This was such a pleasant experience.  For those ""suffering"" through our summer heat, I'd get out to Lee Canyon and do this.  The lifts are open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

It was so much fun!",6,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
MBiQo_evqLa3pUDkh9rjWw,8,2013-08-06,4,K5LJ_y-KmpRasX9oWkWuOA,5,"I have seen Rod Stewart 3 times, once at the MGM Grand Garden and now twice at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace.  The show is fantastic and the venue is too!

When he was many years younger, Stewart told an interviewer from Rolling Stone Magazine that he didn't intend to become a parody of himself by singing ""Do You Think I'm Sexy"" when he was fifty years old.  Now the 68 year old Stewart, as of January, closes his show with just that song and there's a mention of the interview on the LCD panel above.  And, many of the women of all ages think he is.

The show, as another reviewer stated, starts promptly at 7:30.  If you come later, you'll be missing something so plan ahead.  Stewart changes his show a bit now and then by singing some of the songs from the album he released earlier in 2013.  Last night, he did one song from the new album.  But he did many of the standards--""Have I Told You Lately""; ""The First Cut Is the Deepest""; ""Rhythm of My Heart""; ""Forever Young""; and ""Hot Legs"" to name a few.  The only gem I wish he'd do in the show would be ""If Only.""  I really love that song.

Stewart is a very active performer moving to all areas of the large stage and through the audience as he's backed up by a superb group of musicians and fine singers.  He takes full advantage of the band members' talents.  Periodically, he leaves the stage to change clothes--no, he's not as bad as Cher with clothes--but it gives the singers and band members a chance to showcase their individual and collective talents!  It also gives the 68 year old a chance to take a break.

He kicks personally signed soccer balls to the audience and you're lucky if you can get one.  He keeps the chatter to a minimum unlike some performers who have to talk forever about where a song came from, who their parents are, or even to introduce them.  The one song from the new album that he sang last night was an homage to his father and even the intro to that song was just a minimum--what it needs to be to explain it.

One note to the super fans and the younger crowd in the audience.  In case you didn't know, when you buy a ticket to the show, you get the seat, too!  At no extra cost!  Free!  Really!  Would I kid you?  You paid $250 plus fees so sit in the damn seat.  And guys, swaying your asses isn't sexy--it just means you've been hitting the sauce too much in Las Vegas.  On the other hand, there were a few cuties last night that shook their stuff and they (the women) were fine!  Other than that, except for a few songs when everyone's up and swinging, sit the hell down!",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I spoke with the owners son about the surf theme and he was quite a pleasant fellow.  He made everyone who came there feel most wanted.

The food though, is good. I've had the meat jun, spicy chicken, pork and kimchee pancake, and the mandoo. All have had great flavor, and have been prepared well.

As for a casino, it's OK.  What I like more is walking the cobblestone walkway from the parking garage entrance.  Looking at the restaurants, Napoleon's Lounge, and the long lines at the buffet are people watching at its best.

There was no line and I could bring my sandwich back to an area where there were some seats and be comfortable eating.

I walked over to the truck after fellow Yelper Edwin P. walked over.  I was looking at the menu boards when the gentleman said they had a breakfast burrito.  I looked at the filling and decided that would be it.  He gave me a choice of chorizo, bacon, or half bacon - half chorizo.  I went with the 1/2 and 1/2 option.

In a short time, my burrito was handed to me.  It was quite large and it was very hot!  The burrito was filled with scrambled eggs, potatoes, onions, cheese, peppers and both chorizo and bacon.  I had asked for it spicy and the sauce they used was spicy although I could have walked back and gotten some Sriracha.

I have never had Spam until today.  When I looked at their menu and saw the Specialties section, the Spam Scramble popped out and I knew I had to order this.  Along with this, I opted for the two pancakes you can get instead of toast.  I ordered the Orange Creamsicle pancakes that come with orange syrup, whipped cream, and a small container of cream cheese icing.

Breakfast was great!  Spam is just like cubed lunch meat.  The Furikake mixed in gave the scramble some extra taste and the rice was good.  I didn't finish the rice because I wanted to have the healthier food--the pancakes with orange syrup and whipped cream.

I got an annual membership for the museum and tonight I attended my first program at  the museum.  Reception was at 6 PM and the program started at 6:30.  The reception consisted of beer, wine, water, taquitos, quesadilla, and some large chocolate chip cookies.  

The program was in two parts but they dealt with some of the same information.  Col. Peck (ret.) was involved in the program to use the MiGs this country obtained from defectors and use them to train our pilots in fighter pilot training.  T. D. Barnes (ret.) was a CIA employee who was involved in the reverse engineering of these planes.  He led teams that took the planes apart to see how they were built and of what and then put them back together.

Their stories were fascinating and they gave me information I never knew before.  The museum director said there was a full line up of programs slated for the year.  I look forward to them.

Individual membership is $50 per year and it comes with some benefits.  If you are not a member, the cost of the program was $20.  It pays for itself!

I took a helicopter to the Grand Canyon several years ago and it promised a landing in the Grand Canyon with meal, Western shoot out, and the opportunity to ride horses.  Little did I know that I'd see a small part of the canyon itself before landing on a plateau several miles from the river and at a private ranch.

Papillon provided the real thing!  Being a local, I drove to the Boulder City Airport and checked in with Papillon.  I looked around the terminal and checked out some of the gift shop items especially the photographs for sale.

Our pilot, Rob--a fine gentleman and very knowledgable tour guide--made the trip even more pleasant.  We had seen a safety video and Rob reiterated some of the things before we boarded the helicopter.

It was then off to the Grand Canyon with the first sight being Hoover Dam.  He turned the helicopter so both sides had perfect views and photo opportunities.  His descriptions of things were right on.  Being a volunteer at some public lands in the area, I have heard some tour leaders spin false tales about what the tourists are seeing.  Rob was on point with all his descriptions.  Nothing made up, nothing aggrandized for tourists to go back home and tell tall tales to their friends. 

The flight was smooth, the helicopter a thing of beauty, and the flight was perfect with Rob's experience being evident.  Landing a few hundred feet above the river was exciting and a thing of grand beauty.  I wish I had my hiking boots and a half hour to hike to the river and back.

For breads, they offered papadum, paratha, and they make fresh dosa and bring it to your table.  I tried a little bit of each buffet hot item, and enjoyed each dish.  The dosa was light and crispy, with a nice curried potato filling.  For desserts, they had ras malai, carrot halwa, and coconut burfi.  I enjoyed each dessert, especially the ras malai, which is a sweetened creamy paneer.  It was my first time trying it, and it was delicious.  They also had a thermos with cardamom-infused chai tea, with a sign saying it could be made vegan if requested.

We decided on a dozen each of the ATL style, honey bbq, and lemon pepper. The ATL style was my favorite out of the three. It was a delightful mix of savory seasonings and went well with the crisp outer coating of the wings. The honey bbq was evenly coated, and had a good balance of tangy flavor and sweetness. The lemon pepper was a little too overpowering for me, as all I could taste was acidic lemon in each bite.

The wings themselves had very tender meat. The order, once placed, didn't take very long to make.

We also had some honey cinnamon biscuits. I was expecting more of a flaky buttermilk biscuit so I was surprised when they came out. They were more of a drop biscuit, tasting reminiscent of the Chinese style donuts you find at Asian buffets. I loved the light texture of the dough contrasting with the thick syrupy honey.

The fountain drinks are Coke-based, and there are 3 different Kool Aid flavors to choose from as well. Oh yeaaahh (In my best Kool-Aid man voice)!

There was a steady stream of customers coming in, dining in, and taking out orders. We came here around 6 P.M. on a Saturday and while it was busy, we had no problem finding a table.

I sat in the first row here, and it was very comfortable and I had great sight lines.  Again, it's a small venue so you can see well wherever you are.  The theatre has good sound and the lighting was well done for the show.  

There's a lounge area with bar before you enter the theatre so if you're early, you can have a drink and relax.  Seating was done promptly 15 minutes before show time.  The employees I came into contact with last night were all very pleasant with great smiles and were very helpful from ticketing to seating.

The only drawback may be finding the place the first time you go there.  You need to remember you enter a small alley just north of Walgreens and before McDonalds.  Parking is available behind the theatre and it's a short distance down this alley.

A word about the show.  I came to see Stars in Concert which is in its first week at this theatre.  The show was very good.  Rotating impersonators sing live music of famous people.  There was a 4 piece band on a platform raised above the stage.  Last night, there were impersonators of Tina Turner, Michael Jackson, Elton John, Beyonce, Whitney Houston, and the Soul Brothers.  All music is live.  There is no lip syncing!  Not a bad show at all.

You sign up online for the tour.  Parking is in the Zappos' garage off Las Vegas Boulevard before Stewart.  You go to the second floor, sign in with the person in the lobby, and wait for your tour.  You're given an ID badge and a name tag.  Several culture reps divide the group and take you to see Zappos at work.  My culture person was Renée and she was a gem!  She was always happy to be asked a question and she had the answers for us.

We saw some of the call center, the culture section where employees were dealing with customers either online or on the phone.  We got to see the Z Café and the employee patio.

I am sure that the employees are not always smiling and not always happy, but I did see a whole bunch of people who seemed to be happily doing their jobs in a relaxed, informal setting and the idea of culture that Mr. Hsieh has been so focused on works!

The tour lasts just about an hour.  You are free to bring your camera and take photos.  The only thing they ask is that you don't take photos of computer screens (it might have customer information on it or other things that should remain private) and they ask that there be no video.

It was a simple two pieces of grilled bread - not egg battered and fried - with toppings of sliced banana on one and chopped fresh pineapple on the other.

Last night was KNPR night at Cirque's Michael Jackson One. m I looked at the menu and found that there was enough here for her to eat.  Eating tapas portions is great because you can try different things without getting something you're not particularly fond of.

We were quickly brought the iced teas we ordered and then we ordered the following from the Dips and Bites section of the menu:  For me--chicken liver pâté with a port wine jelly on top.  It was delicious and something I can enjoy because Andrea wouldn't even touch the glass if I paid her to do it, even double dared!  

We also got an order of Inside Out French Onion Grilled Cheese and an order of Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets.  The cheese sandwich has three kinds of cheese and the caramelized onions from onion soup in the sandwich.  The ""soup"" is a small metal container of the au jus from onion soup.  The Chicken Pot Pie bites are wonderful!  Small, deep fried tater tot shaped goodness with peas and carrots inside the nuggets.  Boy, were they good!  That about did it for normal food so it was on to dessert.

Andrea got their Peach cobbler and our server warned her it wasn't a standard peach cobbler but had cinnamon ice cream with... At that point, Andrea stopped her and said, ""I'll have that!""  Just say cinnamon and it will be good.  I ordered the greent tea panna cotta that had small bits of fruit and pieces of macadamia nuts on top.  It was also very, very good.

Now about the service, Chef Moonen, whoever did the hiring and the training for your new restaurant deserves a raise!  Everyone, whether they were associated with our table or not, was king, polite, and had a pleasant smile and were very accommodating.  Our server, Alex, was a pure delight.  She knew the menu inside out, knew how to describe the food, recommended some things, and was a very efficient and pleasant server.  The runner who brought the food was also smiling and friendly.  

When we were leaving, I saw an elevator and I asked if it was for use by the general public.  One of their staff said of course and called the elevator for us.  It saved a number of steps to the other side of the Mandalay Place Shops and we exited right outside the casino.  

One final mention about Alex.  She had on this red bustier type top and short shorts!  I almost asked her if I could take her photo, but that would have almost been an outrageous request for obvious reasons.  She was a delight, visually and professionally.  If you read this, Alex, let me know if it's OK for next time!  Chef Moonen, the person who hired should get a raise.  Hint, hint!

I can't wait to go back and try some more of their goodies and I think I've sold my wife on tapas style dinners.",14,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The shop is fairly large, with a main seating area and a room in the back. When we got here on a Friday evening there was a steady line but it moved quickly. Each donut ranges from $1-3 depending on what type you get, with volume discounts for a half dozen and dozen. Note that the specialty donuts like the maple bacon or the fritter won't count towards the half dozen or dozen donut deal so you would have to order them separately.

The selections here are unique, colorful, and generous on the toppings and fillings. We shared a dozen donuts. Varieties that we got included Bavarian cream, lemon, Jesus, cookie monster, and Nutella.

My favorites of all the donuts we had were the lemon and the Nutella donut. The dough was soft and fluffy, and the topping was perfect. The cake donuts like the Jesus (As in Hey-Seuss the Spanish pronunciation, I accidentally ordered it as the Son of God donut lol) were decent but a bit too dense and not soft enough for me. By the way, the Jesus is kind of like a churro or horchata version of a donut, with a creamy glaze and cinnamon sugar topping with caramel drizzle.

Service was fast and friendly at the register. The women's restroom was out of order when we were here, and while they have a soda fountain there aren't any options for plain water from the fountain.

Next time I'm here I might want to try their donut milkshakes which have a whole donut on top. They looked amazing!

Since there were so many different varieties and I could only eat so much sugar in one sitting that evening I definitely want to come back to try more. This is a place you could overload your stomach on donuts so much that someone may very well ask you, ""Hurts, donut?"" ;)",22,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The latte tasted OK for the most part, but had a bit of an unpleasant bitter finish after each sip. I tried some of the nana banana drink which was liquid indulgence. It was a great mix of coffee, banana flavor, and chocolate.

The portions are generous, the prices are reasonable, and service is cheerful.  Unfortunately, they did not have horchata when we went, but they do have a wide array of Pepsi fountain products (Including Diet Dr. Pepper), as well as bottled water and canned sodas.

They have a Taco Tuesday special (.99 per taco, choice of different meats), but today I chose to try the chilaquiles ($6.99).  You have your choice of meat (Beef or chicken) and choice of sauce (Green or red).  I decided on the green chicken chilaquiles. 

We were served chips and salsa while they were making our order.  The chips were hot and fresh, and were light and crispy.  The salsa had a robust, full flavor, with just a little kick of spiciness.  The chilaquiles were a very generous portion, with refried beans and Spanish rice.  The green sauce was nice, but a little too acidic for me, so it was nice to balance the acid of the chilaquiles with the beans and rice.  The chicken was finely chopped, and tender, and there was a good amount of shredded, melted cheese on top.  I tried some of the hard taco, which had a nice, crispy taco shell, with good portions of meat to veggie.

364hhL5st0LV16UcBHRJ3A,13,2014-09-12,8,odox5q-TwOuI2kCI1-hhhQ,5,"The mistake I made coming here last night was coming alone.  I had looked at their menu and thought I'd do the omakase.  My server, Noemi, explained that omakase was meant for two people to share.  She quickly said, ""We can change it and do it for 1.  How's that?""  That was quite OK with me and with that a wonderful meal began.

After being brought some iced green tea, Noemi brought an amuse-bouche of some thinly sliced pickled cucumber wrapped with pickled papaya and topped with feta cheese.  What a grand way to start.  The contrast of flavor with fruit, cheese, and vegetable was a harbinger of good things to come.

My first dish was a grape salad.  It had both red and green grape halves with candied walnuts, enoki mushrooms, and some feta cheese with a light dressing.  What an interesting salad with wonderful flavors!

Next came the star of the evening and according to Noemi, the most ordered thing on the Yonaka menu--the sake orenji--Scottish salmon with orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, lemon and orange oil, maldon, and micro arugula.  Salmon nicely laced with fat cut sashimi style on a bed of orange slices.  The tobiko added so much flavor to the dish.  Beautiful blend of flavors with the orange and the salmon.  The sauce was their homemade ponzu and it was superb!

At this point, Nodemi asked if I could eat two more dishes or was I too full and should we go directly to dessert.  Rhetorical for me but she was serious. I told her that of course I'd go for two more dishes and she said that it would be one more cold dish and one hot dish.  Next came tate ichigo--sliced Hokkaido sea scallops, fresh strawberry, negi, apricot and strawberry relish, hibiscus salt, Thai chili, negi oil, and strawberry sauce.  (I stole the full description from my friend Amelinda so I'll give her credit!) The raw scallops with the strawberry slices was another example of a different take on fish.  It's no wonder they refer to this as modern Japanese food.  It was delicious!

Before the hot course, I was brought a lollipop--a frozen cube of cantaloupe as a palette cleanser.  Very nice touch and very good.

Then the hot dish came.  It was skirt steak pieces with mushrooms, tomatoes, Brussels sprout leaves and some cracked salt.  The meat was a little on the rare side which was good and there were both tomato wedges and halved grape tomatoes.  The cracked salt added so much flavor to the dish.  Now I was feeling full, but there was one more dish to come--dessert.

Dessert was the mango cotta, a large round of mango panna cotta filled with mango ""egg"" made from mango purée.  On the other side of some mango tuile was some mango ice cream on a bed of pistachio butter.  Both sides of the dessert had finely chopped pistachio pieces and it was a tremendous ending to a wonderful meal!

Service was excellent throughout my time there.  The restaurant only had one other table occupied so it was quiet.  The music was perfect--modern and not too loud.

Now all I have to do is get some Yelp volunteers to join me so we can give the full omakase a true workout.  It was quite good of them to allow me to do a lesser version of the omakase with full size dishes of fewer courses.  Very well done and deserving of all 5 stars!",16,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

That being said, I was glad to come to a birthday lunch at Jjanga with some friends.  And yes, I did overeat!

Sushi restaurants seem to try to outdo each other with names for rolls and for fillings as a hook for customers.  Dancing eel, Burning your ass, and Jackpot just to name three--all of which I fully ate or shared with others at the table.

The burning your ass is an example.  It has soft shell crab and spicy tuna but you couldn't taste the seafood because it had to live up to its name.  The tuna was spicy tuna but it was overwhelmed by the spiciness of the roll, the sriracha on top, and then slices of jalapeño on top of that.  But, that's what I wanted and it was good.  It was very hotly spiced rice.

The Jackpot roll and Mel's roll were good.  The crispy things they put on the rolls are interesting and add texture.  It was the first time I'd had them.

For the finale, I had both red bean and green tea ice cream.  It was a nice way to end this food orgy.

Call on Black Friday, make a reservation for dinner some night in December, and receive 50% off.  That's a great deal!

I had a reservation for 6.  There was only one other table occupied when I arrived but it soon got busy.  My server was Jose and he proved., along with all the staff, to be pleasant, polite, and very efficient!

I ordered 4 things--pear salad, ahi tuna crudo, Penne Tegame, and an apple and fig crostata for dessert.  First I was brought water and quickly the iced tea I ordered.  

The starter was the pear salad.  Their menu describes it as Bartlet Poached Pear, Spiced Goat Cheese, Endive, Pecans, Porto Dressing.  It was excellent.  The pieces of pear in the endive leaves with the goat cheese was an amazing combination.  The pecans added a texture element that was perfect.

Next up was the crudo of very thinly sliced ahi tuna with balsamic soy dressing and guacamole. An interesting combination with ahi tuna but it worked very well.

For the main course, I bypassed the signature pasta dish and instead went with the penne Tegame with a spicy Roma tomato and parsley sauce and mozzarella.  The red flecks of pepper could be seen and tasted throughout the dish.  The spiciness was not overwhelming for anyone.  It was excellent.

Jose suggested the cannoli for dessert but I chose something different, the warm apple and fig crostata.  It had an orange and vanilla bean reduction/panna cotta gelato.  I am generally not a fan of warm desserts but this was amazing!  Very delicious and an excellent ending to a delightful meal.

Service was the best!  My iced tea never got more than an inch down from the top when the glass was refilled.  Plates were removed quickly, and people addressed me by my last name taken from the reservation.  This is what I expect from a Four Seasons restaurant and they didn't fail.  In addition, I received a phone call on the way home because they thought they had found an item I may have left behind.

In addition, you can have a panini or crepe made and there are other goodies there, too.  The other choice is to order items off the menu that is part of Sunday brunch.

I first got some treats off the regular buffet like spread, basically junk food--well let's say, food with lots of sweetness.  The winner here was the cake pop.  That was quite good.

I had several items from the order menu.  The lobster havarti Benedict was great and the Simon French toast made from dipping the brioche into frosted flakes was quite good, too.

The winner today though was a small baguette sandwich made with fig jam and bleu cheese.  With the baguette put on the panini maker, the cheese melted and the fig and cheese together was the best thing I had.

We tried the ""monkey brain"" appetizer, a few basic rolls (Salmon, tuna, yellowtail), tuna poke, and the bull roll. The monkey brain is a row of mushrooms stuffed with fresh tuna, then tempura fried. It was drizzled with sauce, and was really delicious. The basic rolls had a good proportion of fish to rice and seaweed, and the fish itself was tasty and fresh. The tuna poke had a tasty marinade, with good proportion of fish to vegetable. Most of the tuna tasted great. However, there were a few pieces I tasted that had some slight gristle on them. The bull roll was amazing. It's one of the best fusion sushi rolls I've had! The presentation is pretty cool too, since the waitress will flambe the aluminum-wrapped roll at your table. As the flames die down, you peel back the wrapping to reveal some nicely grilled bulgolgi beef on top of a spicy tuna, crab, and cucumber roll. It gives a whole new meaning to a surf and turf roll, Asian style!

My server, Mariela, asked if I wanted maple syrup or chocolate syrup.  Hell, in for a penny in for a pound--I'll take the chocolate syrup.  She then asked, dark, light, or white chocolate.  I went with the dark.

The breakfast was not long in coming but it was long enough that I could enjoy watching the tourists think sitting on the patio was OK for this cold morning.  I also watched as the fountains at the Bellagio just shot upwards steadily for about 2 minutes.  The crew were out there doing maintenance.

The French toast was delightful.  It was a small portion, but for something this rich, that's exactly what you want!  I found myself breaking a small piece of brioche off and dipping the bread into the chocolate sauce.  Dessert for breakfast!  That's the way to go!

Service was OK but it could have been better.  It wasn't until I was done with my French toast that I was asked about more coffee.

Still, I rate the breakfast 4 stars because it was great tasting, the people watching was good, and it was a good choice to go here.

The sandwich was made fairly quickly and was well seasoned. It was, however, very watery and runny which affected the consistency of the Cheez Whiz. The juices from the meat and the Whiz dripped down like a monsoon downpour as I ate the sandwich. The bread was soft but slightly cold as I bit into it. Fries were decent and crispy.

The pizza was thin crust, with a slight crispiness to the crust. It was also decent.

I generally get one of two dishes when I go out for pho and this time I stayed with the Bun Bo Hue.  I did not read the menu to see the pork hock on request and I had forgotten Paolo's review.  

The menu states bun bo hue as follows: Hu's signature spicy beef noodle soup served in a slowly simmered lemongrass beef broth, with thick rice noodle, marinated beef shank, pork roll, beef tendon, pork hock (on request), and garnished with onion, cilantro, scallion.

The broth was very rich but there's no way it should have a red pepper by it on the menu.  It is not spicy.  I put all four jalapeño slices in the soup and a fair amount of Sriracha and it still wasn't spicy, but the flavor was good in spite of that.  I sure wish there had been more jalapeño slices.

Service was quick--I was the only person in the restaurant on an early Saturday evening--and the price was average for the size serving.  There was soft guitar (Vietnamese?) music playing and the name of the artist and album were on the screen.  It made a pleasant experience.

I always leave wanting more flavor from the food, and to eat something a little more authentically Middle Eastern I guess.

The menu is quite extensive and has various flatbreads, wraps, and entrees. There is a glass case under the counter that has various candies and delectable looking desserts such as kunafa and rice pudding. I decided on the shakshouka flatbread and had a few bites of a steak shawarma wrap. 

The flatbread was light and crisp, with a thin layer of egg, onion and tomato on top. It had a delicate taste and I liked the seasoning on it as well. It was served warm but by the time I had eaten half of the flatbread it had gotten cold already which made it less appetizing to me since I'm not a big fan of cold egg. The steak shawarma had a plentiful amount of thinly shaved beef with pickle, sauce, and onion. It was nicely seasoned and wrapped in some toasted flatbread.

We couldn't resist dessert after spying all the delicious goodies on display in the glass case! The rice pudding was thick, rich and creamy, with short grain rice and an interesting mix of flavor. I could taste some rosewater in it and I liked that it was lightly sweet. The rice itself was slightly too crunchy for my tastes. The semolina cake with cream was wonderful. I had it warmed, and I loved the mixture of the pudding-like cream with the soft semolina.

We got a meat sampler and veggie sampler to share and although it might not look like a lot of food, eaten with the injera they give you you will leave very full.  The meat dishes are actually more flavorful than the veggie dishes which I find unusual because at previous Ethiopian restaurants I've been to it's been the opposite case.

I tasted this tea-colored liquid.  Well, it tastes like spiced tea... but is that just the spices they add to the water, and then I put in the Lipton bag?

This is the back way"".  We were shown to a table after she bitchily asked us how many people we wanted a table for, but I was miffed that she was so annoyed at the fact we accidentally went in through the wrong entrance.  Looking at the sign when we left, there wasn't any indication that it was the back entrance, nor were there any instructions to enter through the front.  How were we supposed to know it wasn't the right way to enter?  Maybe they should put up a sign or some indication that this isn't the correct entrance (or lock the back door), wouldn't that clarify things a bit?

Hello sexy gorgeous cool seafood!

Hey, a fish market that doesn't smell fishy! The store is spacious, sparkling clean, and holds the freshest seafood you'll find in Arizona. When I walked in I was greeted warmly and one of the family members that runs this shop introduced himself to me. He went over the menu and their fresh fish selections for the day. Everything sounded so good I wanted one of each off the menu! Feeling a bit tropical today, I ended up with the Hawaiian poke bowl ($14) and a lime Arnie ($4). It was made in record time and the poke bowl was a beautiful sight to behold. My first thought was ""Perfection!"" and indeed every element was carefully prepared and compiled together for my bowl. The colors were intense and jewel-like, from the deep rich red of the tuna to the bright kaleidoscope of thinly sliced orange carrot, purple carrot, pink radish and cucumber, the light green edamame, and the brightly yellow mango. Unlike other poke that I've had where the pieces can be thick and unevenly cut, the tuna was cut into perfect cubes and I admired the chef's knife skills with not just the fish but with the sliced vegetables. All these ingredients were perched on a bed of short grain rice. 

The marinade on the poke was simple: soy sauce and thinly sliced onion. There was a dusting of sesame seed and a sprinkle of crushed macadamia nut on top. While the tuna was leaning more towards the super salty side for me all the crisp vegetables and the rice helped disperse the concentrated flavor of the fish. The tuna itself was superb. It had a clean pure flavor.

The lime Arnie was super tangy and zesty. It was made with a mix of green tea and limeade. 

Their fresh fish and seafood selection looked delectable and I will have to go here again to get some of their seafood by the pound. They can even do special orders for you, and can procure delights such as abalone and spot prawns if they are given notice in advance!

The actual shop is in a faded looking shopping plaza next to a martial arts academy. 

Overall I was impressed with the quality and freshness of the food, and also the friendliness of everyone working here. You can tell they take a lot of pride in the product they sell.",24,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Drive up Kyle Canyon Road, SR 157.  When you get to the last curve in the road DO NOT take it.  Rather, go straight ahead on Echo Road the way you'd go to Mary Jane Falls.  In a tenth of a mile, you'll turn to your left into the Echo Trailhead.

There is enough parking here for plenty of cars.  From the northwest area of the parking lot, the trail goes to the base of a hill and then makes a left and you start your ascent.  Part of this first part can be a chest buster, but if you take your time and/or stop for some breaks to catch your breath, you'll make it.  When you get near the top of this first area, do not follow what appears to be a road/trail going off to the right.  Follow the trail sign to the left and you'll come to the Little Falls trail.  

When you connect with the Little Falls Trail, make a right and follow it up the canyon until you're at Little Falls.  Unfortunately, with our very dry winter, there is no water coming down at Little Falls this spring.  It's still a nice hike.",6,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

They were open at 11 when we arrived and we were the early birds in the shop.  I ordered a ""pho dip"" which the menu describes as ""Chinese Five Spice Rubbed Top Sirloin, Pickled Bean Sprouts, Red Onion, Cilantro, Basil, and Chinese Mustard Served on a Baguette with a Pho Au Jus.""  I also ordered a Thai iced tea and  5 spice carrot cupcake with with ginger butter cream frosting.

The iced tea was very good and I was asked about a refill when I was almost finished.  That's never done without an extra charge.

The sandwich was brought to the table and the gentleman asked if I wanted some of their homemade hot sauces.  I'm always game for that and he brought three of them, Thai chili, green monster, and ghost pepper.  He stated that the Thai was the mildest one followed by the green monster.  He then urged great care with the ghost pepper.  For me, the three were good, but I made my way to the ghost pepper and when it was so good, I just spooned it all over my sandwich.  The pho for dipping became an after sandwich drink for me.

The carrot cupcake was then brought and it was very, very good. 

Service was excellent and two of the guys came at different times to the table to check on our progress and to see if we were satisfied.

Chris gave me a taste of his Szechuan shrimp po-boy and that will be something to order the next time I go.  I did forget to get a frequent customer card, but that will be next time, too!  I am a fan of this place!",14,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

When we walked in, it was like reliving my childhood, when we went to Sizzler as a special dinner, to gorge on the salad buffet and the unlimited fried shrimp.  Seeing that the salad bar itself was $8.99, and that for only a dollar more I could get a half dozen of fried shrimp, I figured I might as well!  The shrimp comes with your choice of side: either some incarnation of potato (fries, baked, etc.) or veggie (Such as steamed broccoli).  The shrimp looked just how they did in the '80s, pounded then battered and fried.  They were decent, nothing too special, but not bad.

The salad bar has various salad greens, toppings, and dressings to choose from.  There's also an area with cold shrimp and halved avocados.  I was excited to see that they had such high quality items, but unfortunately the execution was something left to be desired.  The shrimp was deheaded, but whole, so if you wanted de-veined shrimp you had to de-vein them on your own.  The shrimp was also overcooked, and a bit tough as a result.  The avocado was a nice touch, but unfortunately many of them were slightly under ripe, so they tasted a little sponge-like rather than creamy.

The hot foods section along the corner area of the buffet has items such as buffalo wings, meatballs in marinara sauce, and a taco bar.  There are also desserts here, like brownies, bread pudding, and soft serve ice cream with various toppings to choose from.  The taco bar was probably the best part of the hot bar.  There are various outer shells to choose from (Tostada, hard taco shell, soft tortilla, taco salad bowls), 2 meats (Ground beef and carnitas), and veggies (Such as pico de gallo, jalapenos, guacamole, cheese, lettuce).  There's also gooey nacho cheese and refried beans at the counter.  The carnitas was probably the best out of all the taco toppings.  It was slow cooked, and had a rich, deep smoky flavor.  

Service was good, drinks were refilled and dirty plates were removed as needed.  One thing to note is that you cannot add tip to your receipt since you pay for your meal first, and then sit down, so cash will help for tipping your waiter!",5,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I had a lovely evening with some super cool buddies including the awesome Hieyam A. and Grace O. The setup is similar to Haji Baba in that half the business is a market while the other half has a sit down restaurant.

We started with the kibbe as an appetizer. It was a little different than other versions of kibbe I've had in the past but still quite good. Instead of a cube or rectangle of bulgur wheat and beef mixed together, this was more like a samosa with bulgur wheat outer crust with beef inside. It was fried to a light crisp and I enjoyed the flavors and the different textures. I had the veggie combo as an entree which included tabbouli, hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, and grape leaves, served with pita bread. My favorites in the combo were the falafel and the hummus. The hummus was so smooth and creamy with a perfect melding of flavors. The falafel was excellent as well, lightly crispy on the outside, tender soft filling, and a wonderfully balanced blend of seasoning and spice. The tabbouli was the only element I wasn't as thrilled about since it had too much lemon juice for my tastes, but I did also enjoy the baba ganoush which had a smooth light texture and smoked flavor. The grape leaves were decent. 

We finished our meal with some delectable baklava. I usually find baklava a little too sweet, or too dry but the ones we had were a nice balance of flakiness and sweetness. We shared a little bit of each type they had: the pistachio, cashew, and walnut. 

Service was superb and our server was friendly and sweet.

The restaurant closes a little early (8 PM, 7 PM on Sunday) so I do wish they were open a little later but the market is open until 9 PM most days.

The meals we had were very reasonably priced. Mine was $8 and it was a hefty portion that left me pleasantly full afterwards.

Thanks for a great meal. I will definitely be back for more delicious dishes and to check out the market. I especially want to go back to try the Friday afternoon buffet!

Nelson had advised that the al pastor tacos were the best he's had and who was I to disagree when he has so much experience.

I ordered two tacos--remember, we had two more spots to go and then on for a dessert stop.  The two tacos were al pastor and cabeza.  The al pastor is pork meat, seasoned, piled onto a large carousel skewer, and then cooked as it turns.  I ordered the taco with complimentary pineapple at nelson's suggestion.  The pineapple is cubed and spread over the pork pieces.  It makes a great taste combination! 

The cabeza is shredded beef head.  When you get your tacos, there's a separate area on the side where there are all kinds of toppings--pico, cilantro, sauces of differing spiciness, diced onion, and limes.  With this, I ordered some guava juice.

The two tacos were outstanding!  We stood around in the small area eating our delights and having good conversation and lots of laughs.  This is a must do again!

When we ordered, we said we were sharing everything and asked for plates for the splitting.  No problem at all.

We started with an amuse-bouche of chick peas on lightly toasted bread.  A very nice starter to get the meal off to a tasty start.

First up were two starters--warm tripe ""alla""Romana and country style paté.  Both were excellent.  The tripe was cut in small strips that were very tender and the tomato sauce was mild and complimented the tripe perfectly. There was freshly grated cheese on top.   The paté, made with pork, was served with blackberry conserve, greens, and cotica.  The paté was very good.  Two nice starters to begin the meal.

For the pasta course, we got the pork trotter ravioli and the beef cheek ravioli.  They allowed us to order off the tasting menu for the beef cheek ravioli.  For the pork trotter, there was freshly grated cheese.  The beef cheek ravioli was in a sauce of black truffles and crushed duck liver.  Both dishes were superb!  The beef cheek had a hearty flavor of truffle and liver.  The pork trotter had pieces of chive and their blossoms.  The textures in the pork trotter ravioli were great.  Two winners for the pasta course.

For main courses, we got rabbit porchetta and roasted lamb shoulder.  The rabbit was accompanied by a carrot sformato, sunflower sprouts and crispy confit.  The flavors were excellent and the rabbit was very tasty.  The lamb shoulder was cooked medium rare and served with cannellini beans and some greens.  Both main courses wer outstanding!  Very flavorful, simple yet elegant dishes.

The top was pierced and some melted chocolate poured on the top.  The peaches and cream were fantastic!  The dish consisted of lightly grilled peach slices on a bed of mascarpone and a peach sorbet.  A very simple dish executed so nicely.

After dinner, we were brought a box with 7 mignardises.  A tasty selection of little bites to end our meal.  

Service was outstanding during our meal.  Plates were cleared quickly, new silverware and dishes were brought for each course, and the explanations of the dishes was great!

After walking by B&B so many times and looking at the menu, it was really good to try the place.  Eating with a friend also gave me the chance to taste double the amount of items without eating double the amount of food.",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The following the band has makes the evening a lot of fun, too!  There were a number of people dancing in the area in front of the stage where the Las Vegas showroom style tables and chairs had been removed to make room.

We had a group reservation so we were seated in the two large booths stage right.  We also got two drink tickets with the admission.

The guys in the band are very active as they play and sing, moving about the stage and engaging the audience.  Many in the audience dressed in 80s style clothes to celebrate the Spazmatics genre.

The only suggestion has nothing to do with the group.  Getting seated for this even by the South Point showroom staff was slow.  When you have VIP tickets, you'd think you'd be in early.  You'd be wrong.  All the general admission were in before us.

I don't think I'd go back and see them again and I certainly wouldn't wait to the early hours of Sunday for their second set.  They are worth seeing once.",8,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

After a hike, two of us drove to the Clark County Government Center Amphitheater in downtown Las Vegas.  There was plenty of parking when we arrived.  At this festival, you purchase cards in different denominations to be paid to buy food or merchandise.  There was a table at each end of the food vendor area that sold the cards.  I got $20 worth which came as one $10 card, one $5 card, and five $1 cards.  The vendors give you change in cards so all money is handled in one area.

My friend and I first walked along to look at all the food offerings.  The vendors are under the canopy opposite the performing stage at the amphitheater.  The first set you come to were all food vendors and the second set were all clothing, jewelry, and assorted services such as tarot readings and henna tattoos.  

After our walk, we headed back to the food vendors.  We started with splitting an order of chicken momos that came with a tomato based dipping sauce that had some nice spice to it.  That, along with some mango lassi, made for a good appetizer.

The amphitheater has a large grassy area but we set up our lawn chairs under some trees for shade.  After meeting another person, we went back and got some more lunch.  I got an order of pani puri that was something I'd never tried before and it was very good and very filling.  It was explained to me that this was Indian fast food.

Before we left, we watched some of the Raas competition.  We weren't close to the stage but it was better to stay out of the full sun and watch from our seats.

I later learned that the Vaisakhi festival is a traditional Sikh spring harvest festival.  I am certainly a fan of the festival and I'll be back next year.",8,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We went on Sunday to see Adam Richmond and to feast on a multitude of food truck eats.  With the Yelp discount, tickets were $5 per person for general admission, which included parking.  Tickets were $2 per ticket, and after all was said and done each person spent about $20 on food before feeling full and satisfied.  The most popular food trucks were Devilicious and their signature lobster grilled cheese sandwich, and the food truck selling mac and cheese.  Unfortunately, on Sunday they ran out of the lobster grilled cheese around 12:30, but my friend who had waited in the perilously long line said it was quite good.  We tried a multitude of dishes from food trucks such as Hao Bao, Island Loco, and Jamburritos.  My favorites of the day were the dumplings from Hao Bao, and the secret item of the day from Island Loco, delectable malasadas (A deal at $2/1 ticket for 2).  Parking was plentiful, and all the vendors were great.  Although it was quite chilly when we arrived, it warmed up later on.

Adam Richmond's demonstration was the highlight of the day.  There was a huge crowd around the tent, and despite being 20 minutes late, he was every bit like his persona on TV: cheerful, friendly, and just a cool likeable guy.  He showed us how to make Asian style chicken wings with miso-marinated roasted veggies.  He was good at telling us why he used a specific ingredient and had good cooking tips to help us make tastier dishes at home.

All in all, a pretty good day!  I think the prices were a tad bit high, but I think that's to be expected for events like these.  A nice suggestion for next year might be to have a contest and have the public vote on which signature dish reigns supreme!",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

One of the group had arranged for Chef Choi to do an omakase dinner for our party and we ended with a wide variety of dishes over the 15 courses.  The items served were:

Cucumber and seaweed salad
Japanese curry spicy edamame
Spoon trio of oyster, uni, and scallop
Spicy tempura bacon
Salmon kama
Hamachi kama
Taco trio of shrimp, salmon, and tuna
Agedashi tofu
Soft shell crab cake
5 piece nigiri selection
Warm Springs roll
Mr. Monkey ""nigiri""
Double E--freshwater eel over rice with shredded egg
Miso
Green tea
Cheesecake tempura

I have had this place bookmarked for many months.  Starting with a small salad, some edamame, and followed by the spoon trio, the opening courses were smaller beginnings to a good amount of food.  The edamame was coated with Japanese curry and had a really good flavor.  The pods were tender enough to eat whole rather than strip out the beans like I always have to do.

Then came one of the biggest winners of the night and a reason to go back just for this--spicy tempura bacon with a maple and soy reduction.  This was something not seen in any restaurant I've been at before and it was really good. 

Two grilled fish courses followed that were a mixed bag.  The salmon was done too much but the hamachi was sweet and juicy.

A trio of small plates came next with a spicy soft shell crab cake, a trio of tacos, and a bowl of agedashi tofu.  Hands down winner was the trio of tacos made from egg roll skins and filled with shrimp, tuna, and salmon.  Each one was different in flavor and the tuna poke was superb!

Next up were five pieces of nigiri, a roll, and another ""nigirI' of quite a different stripe.  The Warm Springs roll, one of several rice free rolls on the menu, with spicy tuna, spicy soft shell crab, and shrimp with avocado in a rice paper wrapper with eel sauce was very good and a different kind of roll.  The Mr. Monkey, listed as a roll but I refer to it as a special kind of nigiri, with the normal rice layer being a fried banana which is topped with spicy crab and then topped with the spicy tuna.  Very creative and very tasty.

The Double E bowl was good but the eel was overwhelmed by the amount of rice below.  The shredded egg was an interesting take for a topping.

Some light miso to end and then it was dessert.  The tempura cheesecake with chocolate and caramel sauces was excellent.  Creamy and fried perfectly, it's another reason to return.

Chef Choi was a very genial, soft-spoken host and he explained his roots and how he came to being a sushi chef.

We came here a little before 11 on a Saturday, and it was moderately busy, but there were still enough tables available that we didn't have to wait for a seat. The menu consists of breakfast and lunch, with signature egg benedict dishes, omelets, waffles, and sandwiches, just to name a few. I browsed through the benedict selections and decided on the Neptune benedict ($10.95), a Benedict with real crab meat (From a can). I ordered it with the spicy Hollandaise sauce for some extra kick. The delicate sweet flavor of the crab went well with the creamy, perfectly poached eggs and sauce, perched on top of an English muffin. I have to say, I was very impressed with the eggs they use. They are very fresh and high quality, as evidenced by the deep orange-yellow yolks. 

I also tried some of the chorizo waffle, a hefty meal of superbly seasoned chorizo with a large, lightly crisp waffle.

Service was very friendly and attentive. Overall, a good place for breakfast.",8,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I got lost trying to find this place and circled around a few times before deciding to just call the restaurant and get directions. I told the person on the phone where I was and if they could tell me where the restaurant was. After a short pause I heard a characteristic phone click as I just got hung up on. Seriously, who hangs up on a lost potential customer that only wants to get to your restaurant to give you business?? 

Luckily my bubble tea partner in crime Kemlyn B. called to give me directions to Tealight since she had the same problem trying to find the restaurant and had just parked. For your reference it is a few doors down from the movie theater and is neighboring a nail salon. 

The bubble tea menu is pretty limited and includes smoothies in honeydew, coconut, strawberry, and taro, as well as various teas and coffees. After hearing a less than enthusiastic response from Kemlyn about the smoothie she had I chose a Thai iced tea with boba. The total ended up being a little over $4.

The Thai iced tea was decent with a light sweetness. The boba was pretty disgusting though. It was very mushy tasting and disintegrated in my mouth as I tried to chew it.

I wouldn't go here again just for bubble tea, and based on the rude service I probably would skip trying it out again for food.",27,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I ordered the Nantucket Eggs--Grilled jumbo lump crab cakes, poached eggs, baby spinach and hollandaise sauce (from their menu).  I also got a nice round of cubed breakfast potatoes topped with two asparagus spears and two grilled tomato wedges.  I also ordered pork sausage links as a side.  The crab in the crab cakes was excellent and the poached eggs were done the way I like them.  Everything was very tasty.

I can't review MOzen without mentioning the excellent service I received.  My server, Alejandro, let me know this would take a bit longer to prepare and asked if that was all right.  During the wait, the manager came by and introduced himself.  He learned I was a local and seemed pleased to have a local visiting the restaurant. He brought me the dinner menu and invited me to return for some Asian fusion dishes.  He also offered to bring me a newspaper to read while I waited.

Alejandro was equally gracious and on the ball.  He refilled my coffee several times, came by to see if everything was prepared right, and saw to it that I received excellent service.

When Pure Fitness on Baseline kicked the bucket and LA Fitness took over the Pure Fitness enterprise, they allowed Pure Fitness members to continue their memberships at any affiliated LA Fitness location.  

Now, honestly speaking, compared to a gym where I was paying 3 times as much in Cleveland for a place that was a lot older, with older equipment and no pool, LA Fitness is quite nice.  The locker room is spacious and sparkling clean.  Although there is a nice looking sauna in the locker rooms, I haven't really used them since we live in a desert and I don't really need to be any more dried out.  

There is a good selection of equipment for cardio and weights for you to choose from, and whenever I've been there at various times and days there hasn't really been much of a wait, if any, to use any machines.  The cardio machines have TV integrated on them so you can plug in your earphones and listen to local network channels and a few basic cable channels (Bravo, MSNBC, FOXNews, ESPN, to name a few).  I haven't really tried the classes so I can't really comment on their quality.

The one thing that I do miss about previous gyms is that they don't provide towels for you to use during your work out, and they don't provide much in the way of disinfectant to wipe down the equipment after you are done working out on a certain machine.  Also, there isn't as much as a personal feel to this gym as in others, so if you know what you're doing and have your routine already down, it works out OK.  If you are a neophyte to using weights and proper posture, weight training, or figuring out your cardio routine you will pretty much be on your own unless you request personal training.

I arrived shortly after they opened at 11:30 and there was one other table occupied.  Before I left a bit more than an hour later, many tables were occupied.  

My server was Erik.  He was great!  He asked me if I wanted to hear the specials but I wasn't interested in what was being offered.  I did ask him the size of the tomato soup because I wanted an entrée also and didn't want to overdo it with the soup.  Satisfied it was smaller in size and not a bowl, I ordered that.  I then asked if he had his choice between two dishes which would he get.  I took his suggestion and ordered the bowties country-style.

 During this time, I was brought my iced tea and a trio of sliced bread--focaccia, Italian, and ciabatta.  The runner also had containers of EVOO and balsamic vinegar.  I asked him for just the olive oil.  I don't like balsamic mixed with olive oil for bread.  I needed some salt for the olive oil but there was no salt on the table so I did without.  The bread was very fresh and very good.  I had two pieces so not to destroy my appetite.

The tomato soup came and after Erik ground some fresh pepper, I tasted it and it was a winner.  This is not your normal puréed tomato soup.  Rather, it was more like seasoned, squeezed Roma tomatoes.  The soup had good body to it.  A very auspicious start.

Then came the bowties country-style.  After some freshly grated cheese was added, I tasted the bowties.  Great flavor.  Country style means it's served with chicken breast cubes, broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, roasted garlic, and a parmesan-white wine sauce.  This was very good!  Had this not been my meal for the day, I would have stopped and had some boxed to take home for later.  Instead, I bit the bowties and finished them off.

Erik approached and asked if I was considering dessert.  He got a dessert menu and before handing it to me said, ""I usually recommend the dessert trio.""  I looked over the menu and he was right on.  That's what I ordered.  I was brought a plate with a demitasse size cup with crème brûlée, a small square of tiramisu, and a square of strawberry pastry cream Napoleon.  All three were good, but the pastry of the Napoleon was tough to cut.  There was no flakiness to the crust at all.

This was a great choice for lunch/dinner.  I could look out the window and watch the planes at McCarran taxi to runway 1L for takeoff.  It's across Sunset Road but it was close enough to enjoy the view.",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

First our iced tea orders were taken and we were brought some slices of standard Italian bread with a container of olive oil for dipping. 

I ordered the special of the day, a risotto with lump crab.  My wife ordered the Pollo Romano, a chicken breast--""Romano crusted chicken scaloppine"" and served with penne in a sugo rosa.  My wife's chicken was very good but there was more of a breading taste than romano to the chicken.  The penne was very bland.  A little salt helped that along.  My risotto was good and there was a fair amount of crab meat.

We shared a slice of mezza notte chocolate cake.  It's very rich and very good.  Lots of chocolate drizzled with chocolate.

Service was good.  Iced tea was refilled and the server took my Landry's card early and linked it to our order.  

While you can sit along the windows by the pool, I didn't push for that.  The one table remaining along the window had a large man with a tattooed back almost pressed against the window.  Needless to say, that wasn't a view of the pool I wanted to have.

When I opened up the wrapping, I have to admit I was underwhelmed with what I saw. It was a very basic looking sandwich for close to $7. The bread, while nice in that it is baked fresh, tasted gummy. They forgot to include onions in the sandwich, which would have helped to break up some of the saltiness of the sandwich from the smoked turkey meat.

The happy hour menu seems to have changed a bit from the online version since they took off their crudo selections. The only discounted menu item I ended up getting was the crispy pig's ears ($5 during happy hour). I also had the abalone crudo ($20) and bone marrow. Note that the bone marrow on the menu is only listed as an add-on with the brisket for $5 but you can definitely request it on its own for a little bit more ($8).

The crudo came out first. It was a delicate plate of sliced abalone, marinated celery, and thinly shaved carrot. The flavors were crisp with an acidic bite and I liked all the different components when eaten together. For that reason I wished there were more shaved carrot in the dish to go with the celery and abalone instead of two pieces. The abalone itself had a mild, slightly sweet flavor.

The bone marrow and crispy pig's ears came out next. This was my first time having bone marrow, and while I appreciated that they offer it, it had a very neutral flavor, like eating pure buttery fat spread onto toast. The toast slices themselves were plentiful, but I didn't like the actual bread. It was very hard in some parts and overly chewy in others which made it hard to appreciate the flavor of the bone marrow when all I can think about it how unappealing the bread was. 

The crispy pig's ears are one of Crudo's most popular dishes but apparently they were having an off-night when we received our plates. The sliced fried bits were very hard. Flavor and texture wise it was like eating the tough, thick pieces at the very bottom of a chicharrones bag that you can buy at the grocery store for a dollar. I did enjoy the spicy piquant sauce it was marinated in though.

Service was friendly but slow to take orders and drop off checks; drinks were refilled as needed though. They also forgot to split our check and we had to remind them but that's a minor point.

The actual restaurant is set in a scenic, hidden section of this shopping center. I actually turned into the part of the plaza that faces the street, where Nook is, but the large Crudo sign I saw actually said to head to the back area. This part of the plaza unfortunately doesn't have great parking options as compared to the front since the back lot is smaller, the road is a lot narrower, and you have to be very careful driving around since there are runners going back and forth along this lot.

My total was $40+ with tax and tip with no other drink than plain old water. Even though I had spent a decent chunk of change on food my stomach felt like I had only eaten half of an appetizer. Granted, abalone is a high ticket, hard to procure delicacy so I know half my cost went into this rare seafood menu item, but the cost, with inconsistent food and service don't really inspire me to want to come here again with gusto.",27,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

While I was waiting for the house to open, I looked at some of the things they sold.  A fair number of DVDs of various sci-fi movies, sci-fi comic books, and many figures from the Walking Dead.  I had no idea who the characters are but they have them.

The theatre in the back is less than 50 seats so, yes, you would call it an intimate theatre.  No bells and whistles--just some theatre style seats, five rows deep and four on each side of an aisle.  The seats are mounted on some risers so there's a good view of the stage.

For this performance, a curtain was drawn across the front to cover the white screen used for showing sci-fi movies.  For this play, that was more than adequate.

There are several lunch specials to choose from and they include a piece of crab rangoon and your choice of soup or salad. The soup for the day was a vegetable soup, which I chose with my red curry chicken, Thai hot. Preparing in advance for the spicy feast to come, I also ordered a Thai iced tea ($2).

The Thai iced tea had a lovely ombre transition from creamy white to rich auburn. It was almost too pretty to mix up to even out the cream and tea (Almost). It was served in a tower-like tall glass. It was an excellent compliment to the bold, spicy flavor of the red curry, which had a hearty amount of meat and a variety of nicely cooked vegetables. As Thai hot, it was actually the penultimate level of spiciness, as the ""super hot"" was the one spicy level to rule them all. They definitely delivered on the spice end, and I thought the heat level was appropriate for Thai hot. As for the crab rangoon and the soup, they were pretty plain and served more as filler for the meal. 

Service was excellent and the young gentleman here especially did an admirable job making sure everyone was satisfied with their meals.

So, exceptional service, great prices, and a lovely atmosphere. How can you go wrong? :)",15,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We came here right before happy hour ended at 7 which allowed us to indulge in some discounted dishes such as the poke bowl, sushi burrito, agedashi tofu and chicken skewers. We also ordered a few selections from the main menu. This included small bites like asparagus, quail egg, cheese Spam katsu, and meatball skewers. The only larger meal we ordered (Aside from the happy hour poke bowl) was the freshwater eel.

My favorites were the poke and eel. The poke was very fresh, with a deep rich red color, and a good amount of seasoning. The bowl came with rice, nori strips, seaweed, and crab salad. The eel was a beautiful presentation with tender eel, sweet sauce, and vegetables on the bottom. A more unique dish was the ""sushi burrito"" which was basically a modified roll with ingredients like spicy tuna, tamago and crab salad, wrapped in soy paper and cut into 2 like you would cut a burrito in half.

I wasn't as big of a fan of the cheese Spam katsu. The gooey melted cheese was similar to Velveeta and it was way too salty combined with the Spam. I did like the crispy crunch of the breading, but maybe some sweet sauce or a different cheese with the katsu would balance out the flavors more.

When we were seated and ready to order my server took down my friends' orders and then walked away. We had to exclaim to her loudly ""Wait come back"" for her to actually take my order down. There seemed to be a miscommunication about the amount of food we wanted to order but instead of apologizing she had an attitude about it, like it wasn't her fault she decided to leave a customer hanging without taking down their order. Service was better as the meal continued though and drinks were refilled and plates taken away as needed.

Service could use an attitude adjustment, but I'll be back to try more dishes.",21,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I love the Origen Building with its movie ""Miracle in the Mojave"" about water and the lack thereof in the Las Vegas Valley.  It's a brief film, narrated by Martin Sheen, and it quite nicely relates how the area came to be what it is geologically.

The flash flood in the Origen is also fun to see.  When it's not too hot, I like to go in the back and see the animals in the fenced area or in the display domes.

I really didn't know who Meat Loaf was until I had to chaperone dances as high school principal.  Almost every dance, the girls, especially, would request the DJ play Paradise.  The girls sang the lyrics...""Will you love me..."" and the boys would respond with ""...let me think on it...""  That's when I knew who Meat Loaf was.  My musical tastes had diverged from rock after graduate school and the beginning of working for a living.  ""Paradise"" was well done tonight and I brought back so many good memories.

I was surprised to know that Meat Load did the music for Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Seriously, folks, I have not lived under a rock for the last 30 years or so.  It's just that I knew the name and didn't associate his name with some of the music.

Near the end of the show, they have some large artificial penises from which they shoot T-shirts.  I caught one tonight.  The little lady next to me thought she was going to get.  Afraid not, sweetheart.  I hope your black and blue goes away soon!   The shirt says ""I Saw Meat Loaf in Las Vegas.""  Now I'm glad I went.  Wait, I live here!

This is a show I could easily see again.  It's very enjoyable and Meat Loaf really puts all his energy into a good 2 hour performance.  There was one complaint I had about the show.

For $30 you get your choice of 3 appetizers (Pretzel bread with fondue, Caesar salad, French onion soup), 4 entrees (Ribs, fried chicken, salmon, sweet corn cannelloni), and various desserts (Salted caramel custard, apple monkey bread, chocolate toffee tart).  A mug of beer on tap or a paper-bag beer is also included in your $30, which makes it a great deal!  I had the pretzel bread with cheese fondue, which was a sizable portion, with soft, salted bread and smooth, tasty cheese.  Another person had ordered the Caesar salad, which was decent, but nothing extraordinary.  For the main course I had the salmon, which was decent.  It was cooked well, very tender, and it was served with apples, fennel, and some sweet glazed wheatberries.  For me, it was a tad too sweet due to the apples and sweet wheatberries, and the portion was small compared to the normal price of the meal ($20).  I tried the ribs which were nice and tender, and the chicken, which kind of reminded me of KFC original recipe, except with better quality, more tender chicken.  For dessert we shared some apple monkey bread and the chocolate toffee tart.  Both were delicious.

I think if I were paying full price for all these items, it would be a 3 star experience for me.  Since we got so much for $30, it was definitely worth trying this restaurant out for restaurant week.  Would I go here again?  I would probably go here to try out their happy hour, or maybe to get a light meal and also try some of their interesting sounding cocktails.",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Portillo's serves up all your Windy City favorites like Italian beef and Chicago style hot dogs. They also have fries and burgers. For sweet treats, they have various shakes, malts, and desserts.

We shared a big beef, dipped, cheese fries, and a large vanilla shake. The big beef was excellent. The beef and broth had a really nice, rich flavor, and the bread held up well to being dipped in broth. We added sweet peppers and mozzarella, which were both good additions to the sandwich ($.50 extra per topping). As for the fries, rather than putting the cheese on top of the fries, the fries and cheese are supplied separately so that you dip the fries into the cheese. The fries themselves were crisp and crinkle-cut. The shake was huge, and very thick.

While the parking lot is a bit small, the restaurant itself is quite spacious, and we had no problem finding a seat despite it being busy on a Saturday afternoon.

Shortly after being seated, while I was looking at the menu once again, two friends from Yelp--some of the first people I met when I first started Yelping--were leaving and stopped by to say hello.  They then pointed oiut the two best dishes in their opinion.  Who was I to disagree with that?

I started with a Thai iced tea and some water and then ordered two items--shrimp and pork siu mai and Hakka fried rice pot.  The shrimp and porl siu mai have a nice blend of jicama, mushroom, peanut, shrimp, and pork.  The dumplings were topped with some gold leaf.  At the same time the dumplings were brought, a server came with the rice hot pot which is finished at the table.  The rice is in an extremely hot pot and the server adds chile sauce for spiciness (if you want), mushrooms, and soy broth.  The server mixes the rice, vegetables, pork belly, and sausage with the items he put in.  The pot is left with two spoons for getting this richness out.  

From then it was having one siu mai, some fried rice, one siu mai...repeat.  Both dishes were very good.  The Hakka fried rice comes in two sizes, regular and a 1/2 size for someone dining alone like myself. 

My server asked me about dessert and I had been prompted by all to enjoy the shaved ice but I wasn't sure I could finish the large bowl it comes in.  My server told me they now have a smaller portion of the shaved ice.  Bingo.  Dessert for me.  I got a small order of the shaved ice and I chose the malted milk topping, crispy chocolate pearls, Maldon salt, and bacon for the three additional toppings and I got chocolate sauce drizzled on top.  This shaved ice is like nothing I've had before.  It's almost like ice cream it's so rich.  The toppings were all good and the smaller size was perfect.

Service was excellent.  The servers were attentive and helpful with suggestions and I appreciated their help with letting me know about the smaller portions.  With 50% off the total, the meal was a bargain when compared to normal prices.

This shop is tiny, especially considering the amount of space that neighbors such as San Tan Brewery occupy, but that just adds to its charm. Right when I stood in front of the restaurant I knew this was my place when I saw the Black Knight from Monty Python guarding the entrance. :) The decor is nostalgic, a nod to the days when Popeye and Wimpy were popular and Saturday Evening Post was a household staple. I read a bit about the history of this little shop and it turns out the owner Randy wanted to carry out his father's original restaurant legacy (His father owned two Wimpy's restaurants back in the 30s-40s but had to shut them down when he left to fight for our country in WWII). So, he opened up this restaurant in his memory. 

The menu consists of burgers, sandwiches, and hot dogs. Drinks are by the bottle or can. I had the quarter pound burger special advertised outside the door, adding pepper jack and green chiles. I also tried some of the Reuben sandwich.

The burger was excellent. The bun was lightly toasted and the hand formed patty was tender, juicy, and well seasoned. The pepper jack and green chiles were great and provided a little spicy kick to the meal. I didn't realize that the burger deal was supposed to come with chips in addition to my soda until after I looked at a photo of the specials board; the lack of chips was unfortunate because I was still hungry after eating the burger. I tried a bite of the Reuben which was basic but the meat had a lot of flavor in it. My friend had a dirty burger which was a heaping mountain of chili and French fried onions on top of his burger. Next time I'm feeling particularly gluttonous I will get this burger!

There aren't a lot of tables in the restaurant and it closes early so get here early to indulge in a delicious meal.

I opted for the Connecticut lobster roll, a buttery warm concoction of toasted bread and fresh lobster. The meat was perfectly tender, and had a lovely coating of melted butter that meshed well with the sweet lobster meat. The only slight negative is that I would have liked a little more lemon juice over the whole roll to provide some extra acid flavor to accentuate the sweetness of the meat even more (I could only taste a faint hint of lemon towards the end of the roll).

I stopped here last night with a coupon from the parent company Lettuce Entertain You.  I sat on the patio.  It was very pleasant with all the LP heaters around and it was fun watching the tourists walking on the Strip.

I started with a bowl of tortilla soup.  It was quite good and the service was different.  The bowl was placed on the table.  In it were tortilla strips, avocado cubes, some cilantro, queso fresco, and some pasilla chilis.  The server then poured the soup from a pitcher over the ""dry"" ingredients in the bowl.  The soup had a very nice flavor and was a good start to the meal.

The main dish was the carne asada tacos.  The server had asked how I wanted the steak cooked and it came out rare as ordered.  There were rice, beans, and the steak slices with 5 small soft tacos standing in a metal container.  The beef was good, but the rice and beans were a little bland.  Nothing a little Tapatio couldn't help!  

For dessert, I got the chocolate layer cake.  It was a circular chocolate layer cake coated in chocolate with some freshly made whipped cream.  Excellent!  You can tell from my photo that I didn't care for it at all.  I almost asked for a clean straw so I could snort the remaining crumbs.

Summary:  The meal was good but it is pricey and not somewhere I'd go without some coupon.  I give it an extra 1/2 star because my server, Tiffany, was absolutely top notch.

From the outside you think, ""This is the place Ben recommended?""  Once inside, it's a totally different world.  Red and white checked tablecloths on the tables, movie posters, and photos of old actors and actresses on the walls, and a very friendly staff.

I took a seat and a server brought me a menu and asked about something to drink.  I ordered coffee and he brought me both coffee and a glass of ice water.  The coffee was promptly refilled while I was there.

I had seen the menu online and I knew they had a good breakfast selection.  I ordered the Ranchero omelette which is a 3 egg omelette with pieces of sausage, green chilies, avocado,  cheddar cheese, and topped with a ranchero sauce.  It comes with fried potatoes and toast or biscuit.  In my case, I ordered rye toast and they asked if I wanted it buttered or not.

While waiting, I was surprised by the number of calls they got for delivery.  It seemed like someone was always on the phone taking an order.  In a short time, a server brought my breakfast and asked if I wanted any hot sauce.  Cholula, of course.  I was all set.

The breakfast was excellent.  Hearty and really more than I should have eaten even letting the plates go with some of the toast and potatoes unfinished.

It's kind of weird to name your mixed drink after a rare and debilitating disease but as long as I don't get elephantitis from drinking it I'll go with it!

I had the daily special, a mango curry, ordering it with seafood. I also tried the drunken noodles and the king of garlic. 

The mango curry was a hefty portion of red curry sauce, vegetables, and seafood including fish, scallops, shrimp, and calamari. The scallops were rubbery tasting but the other seafood were cooked well. I was disappointed that I requested this dish hot but it tasted very mild to me, like a 2/10 in scale of spiciness. In general the curry was too sweet for me and it had more of a one dimensional taste compared to other dishes I tried.

The drunken noodles had a depth of flavor and a hint of smokiness which was great. It was a sizable portion as well.

The king of garlic was a mighty meal living up to its name. This is the stuff that vampires have nightmares about because of the amount of garlic they packed in this dish. It was a knock out punch of bold flavors, varied textures, and a hint of spiciness. The beef was tender and well seasoned. It was probably the best dish out of the few that I tried.

I had a Thai iced tea to go with my meal which was too sweet for my tastes. They serve it automatically with ice but in the menu it says they will charge you $.75 if you request it with low ice or no ice. Interesting.

The staff is very good at assisting the 4,000 people a night that come for shows.  The process of leaving is very smooth.  Last night, I went to see Rod Stewart.  The show ended at 9:30.  I was back to my house just before 10 PM, a drive of about 10 miles.  Their knowing how to get people out of the theatre is impressive.

The theatre is quite nice.  The sound system is first rate.  But other than the performers themselves, the star of the evening is the LED screen behind the performer.  Stewart made good use of its capabilities.  Elton John on the other hand didn't use it much depending instead on stage props and signs.

I was even at the Colosseum for a lecture by former President Bill Clinton.  It was a wonderful place for such a mundane thing as that.",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

There are 2 TVs here showing various channels and on certain nights they have live music (Jazz). We were here on a Saturday night when they had a live band and it was fairly busy as there was a constant stream of people trickling in to get to-go orders or dine in and enjoy the music.

I tried the grape leaves and roasted garlic hummus. Both were a sizable portion. The grape leaves were filled to the brim with well seasoned meat and rice. The sauce- Hellooo lemon! It was a bit too lemony/acidic for me but overall I enjoyed it. The hummus was smooth and had a creamy texture. I could taste a bit of the garlic but I didn't really like the addition of cumin to the hummus. They included a lot of pita bread to go with it which I appreciated.

YpNCrt2l7TEsZvUWMr72sQ,5,2013-09-03,0,8gBJ9v8jwbaBiXEArCfPTQ,4,"I first hiked the Lone Mountain Trail in 2005 and I have just driven by on my way to other hikes until today.  Our Las Vegas city gym was closed because of Labor Day so a friend from the gym and I decided to do the relatively short Lone Mountain hike.  Except for the humidity of the monsoon season, the morning was perfect for hiking.

The hike is in what I refer to as three sections--Levels 1, 2, and 3.  Level 1 is at the first landing, the first saddle, where there's a bench for taking a rest and enjoying the view.  For some people, that's as far as they go and that's OK.

From here, the trail goes up wonderful limestone rock for the most part with a minimum of gravel or scree of any kind.  At the end of this section, you arrive at what I refer to as Level 2.  From here, it's one more push until you get to the top and you can fully enjoy the views of the Las Vegas Valley.

Looking south, you see Summerlin and Red Rock Canyon, to the west the Spring Mountains, the the north the Las Vegas Range with Gass Peak and the Sheep Mountains beyond, and finally to the eats you get views of the resorts along the Strip and Frenchman Mountain on the east side of the valley.

Find a not too sharp area at the top, have a snack and some good conversation, and then return the way you came.  You can come to the peak by either the east or south sides but that should be reserved for experienced hikers because the drops can be fatal if you slip and fall.

The easiest access to the trail is to take the 215 and get off at Cliff Shadows Parkway.  Go north on Cliff Shadows to Alexander Road, make a right and head east to vegas Vista Trail which is the last street before Lone Mountain.  Head north of Vegas Vista and there's a parking area at the end of the street where they've put some concrete barricades.  From here, the way is very evident to the trail.

PS:  Be on the lookout for bees.  They are generally more active in the spring but it pays to watch where you're walking.  In May of 2012, a man was stung continually as he was going to the peak.  It was estimated that he was stung about 300 times.  He was able to dial 911 from the peak and was rescued by helicopter and survived after being in bad shape for several days.  There used to be a sign warning about Africanized bees, but it is now missing.  Just be alert!

Sodas and bottled water are $6 so we decided to forgo any refreshment until after the show. They do have a drinking fountain next to the restrooms though if you need a quick sip. 

For the show our seats were very close to the front in an area typically reserved for the pit. There were fold up chairs for our seats but they weren't labeled and our seating attendant wasn't very helpful but eventually we figured out where our seats were. In general we had a good view but as is much of my luck as a short person at concerts I always end up sitting in front of a family of giants as I had to crane my neck a few times to see the show. 

Acoustics in the pit area were alright, but at times it was waay too loud, especially when the warm up act started shouting into his mic.

VUOMSsBfoBxx_PP81INt8g,4,2013-05-07,3,GTvFI4cv_7lSkhuwtogI4Q,4,"This show has a lot going for it.  I was a bit taken back by some of the less than stellar reviews, but I found the show much to my liking.  Here are my positives:

The show moves along quite nicely.  The 12 month calendar idea is a take off on the Playmate of the Month.  After all, Claire Sinclair was the Playmate of the Year in 2011.  What I thought was well done from a theatrical point of view was the ease of transition for the most part from one scene to the other.  There were distractors that took your attention away from the stage so the crew could move into place the next scenes set pieces.  For example, some members of the band came down front and played--damn well, I might say!  When they were done, the stage lights came up and we were ready for the next scene.  Thoughtfully planned transitions like that work and there's no ""down time"" between scenes.

The band.  Well, what more can be said.  There are 6 members and they rock the house.  There are three horn players, two guitars players, and a drummer.  Boy are they ever good!  They're almost scene stealer sometimes.

Then there are the dancers--5 of them--four women and one man.  They are all very talented and have good moves.  The ladies are dressed scantily enough to be sexy but this is not a topless show.  If that's what you're expecting, go across the street to Olympic Gardens and see all the tits you want.  

Claire Sinclair, a name I hadn't heard until this show came about, acts as a narrator for the show.  Based on the earlier reviews, her speaking role has diminished.  She did some talking about where the idea came from for the show but she didn't overdo anything nor did she hog time.  Periodically, she'd do some dancing, most notably behind a translucent scrim, and she removed a top and tossed it aside.  When the scrim was removed, it left Claire clothed in a little less clothing albeit still covered.  She's there for her fame (notoriety) and she certainly has the body to please any eye gazing her way.

My favorite months were March, May, and September.  Without giving too much away, the March dance was to the song ""Come Fly With Me"" and the sole dancer was a flight attendant.  Really well done and choreographed well to the music.  May was a solo dancer again with the drummer near her and he'd rap the sticks on the platform on which she was standing and she'd tap dance a reply.  His stick work was amazing and her dancing was excellent.  Finally, the September theme, another solo dance, was the girl as a baseball player.  She could bend over the plate so provocatively.  It was great!  In between, there was a scene with Claire on a bed with some moving pillows.  Enough said, go and see the show to see for yourself.

It seems like there have been changes made to the show during the preview period and even since the official premiere last week.  It seems to be a polished show and I enjoyed my evening.

Finally, the theatre is a pleasant place with comfortable seating.  While I could see well, I wasn't close enough to see as well as I wanted to.  Oh, there's always a next time and a reason to go again!",4,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I really like this restaurant--the food, the décor, and the general ambiance.  Onto the meal.

I'm glad Chef McClain does not shy away from salt.  There's soft butter served with a small container of sea salt.  Several of the dishes had a salt flavor that enhanced the food.  My server and I spoke about this for a bit and he agreed with me about using salt. 

Course 1: Dinner started with whelk toast with a tropical sangrita.  The sangrita was flavored with padron pepper. ginger, and lime.  There was a nice kick from the padron pepper.  Very refreshing beginning.  The whelk toast was very good.

Dessert:  Creamy white chocolate with coconut.  This was a white chocolate soup.  The white chocolate was in a small pitcher and the server poured the liquid chocolate over the rum-compressed pineapple and sweet tapioca that were in the bowl.  There was also a serving of mango sorbet.  The tapioca was cooked to perfection, the white chocolate was addicting and the pineapple was great!

After being dismissed from jury duty, I wanted to celebrate having a half day free so I headed over to Chanpen to indulge in some tasty Thai food! They currently have a good selection of lunch specials for $7.95 that includes a small eggroll, soup, and wonton crisps. I decided on the red curry with tofu, Thai hot. 

The interior is cute with sunny warm accents and unique decor. I might have indulged in a Thai iced tea had the server asked me if I wanted an additional drink after taking my order, but for my meal today I stuck with my tall Mason jar of water with lime wedges. 

The soup was served first, piping hot. It was a clear, well seasoned broth with cabbage, celery, and cilantro. The rest of the meal came out fairly quickly, and had a nice presentation. The curry had a lot of fried tofu and vegetables. The curry itself was more like a regular hot to me, hot enough to sear the tongue a little but not enough to really make my nose run. The wonton crisps were light with good crunch, and the eggroll was pretty basic, served with a super sweet sauce.

Service was speedy and my check was presented to me when I was halfway done through my meal, so if you are in a rush for lunch this is a good choice to eat.

I met friends the other night who suggested this for dinner and off we were.  They have been there several times and could reocmmend things.

For an appetizer, I got a sausage roll, a spiced sausage wrapped and baked in a flaky pastry.  The sausage came sliced and was accompanied by a dish of mustard sauce that was excellent.  It really gave the sausage a nice flavor although it was good without the mustard.

For the mains, all three of us got steak and kidney pie.  This was a first for me and I enjoyed it a lot.  The steak cubes were very tender and the kidney had a very smooth texture and was quite flavorful.  The pie was topped by a flaky crust and it was piping hot.  (Sweeney Todd fans will get that).  With the pie comes mashed potatoes and gravy and a healthy serving of peas.  It turns out to be a large and filling meal.

Our reservation was for 6:30 and we were seated promptly.  The restaurant wasn't very busy, but within an hour, most of the tables were filled and the music was playing louder than I normally like.  It did not interfere with our conversation so it was easily tolerated.  

We started with four items from the starter section of the menu--babaganoush, lebaneh with feta, kibbeh, and spanakopita.  With the babaganoush and lebaneh, we got an order of laffa bread served very warm in a paper bag.  We cut the bread so each could have half.  I thought the lebaneh with feta was outstanding.  I love feta and it stood out in this dish.  The babaganoush was also very good.  The spices with these two starters was the beginning of excellently spiced/flavorful foods we'd experience throughout the rest of the meal.

Next we got the kibbeh and spanakopita.  Both were very good.  The flaky spanakopita was creamy inside and the kibbeh had great spice flavors.  We also got another laffa.  The server had seen us cut the bread in half before instead of tearing ti apart, and she had the cooks pre-cut the bread for us in more bite sized pieces.

From these starter dishes, we moved on from the mezzes.  Next up were falafel with tahini and tabouleh, and mushrooms with puffed rice, hazelnuts, and dates.  The winner between these two dishes--the mushrooms.  The nuts and puffed rice were amazing texture counterpoints to the mushrooms and made for an outstanding dish. 

From here, we had the lamb tagine with apricots, couscous, silan, and topped with sesame seeds.  A very good mix of flavors with apricots that were excellent in the tagine.  Our second ""main"" dish was moussakah which consisted of very thinly layered eggplant, béchamel, and bolognese and was an excellent dish.

We finished off the main part of the meal with a kale flatbread.  The flatbread had garlic oil, crème fraiche, and parmesan with the kale on top.  It was baked perfectly.  I had a few pieces boxed and that was breakfast the next morning.

Time to move on with dessert.  I thought it odd that Cleo would have sticky toffee pudding.  We ordered that and a fig and almond pannacotta.  Hands down, the pannacotta was the best of the two.  The figs were soft from being stewed in almond syrup and the pannacotta was topped with amaretto.  The was also a piece of almond brittle that we didn't taste because it was simply too hard to break apart.  We enjoyed a pot of French press coffee with our dessert.

Service during our dinner was well paced.  Water glasses were refilled often and I was brought fresh glasses of iced tea.

About three hours later, we left, full, but not uncomfortable.  We had not been able to try the duck bastilla because they were out.  That's a need to go back to try thing, but we'll check in advance ti make sure they have the duck.",11,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

It was about 1 PM and during the time when the lunch specials were in effect.  $11 for a variety of lunch dishes that includes a pot sticker, and salad, and the dish of your choice from the list of noodle or rice dishes.

I opted for the green curry chicken with rice.  The menu had a notation that the dish was one of their spicy dishes--just what I wanted.  They did not ask for a hotness number I wanted such as a scale of 1-5 or 1-10.  It was made the way they make it.

First up, I was brought a pot sticker and a small salad.  The pot sticker was OK.  Nothing special and a bit soft on the bottom from the sauce on/under it negating the frying of the dumpling.  The salad was great with the flavor of rice wine vinegar being very prevalent.

The curry was very good and I was surprised that it had the zing it had.  Most places that indicate a dish is spicy with a small pepper or some other notation aren't really my spicy level--they're too mild.  This had a bit of zing. More would have been better but this was OK.

Service was good throughout.  I had never been here before, so when I walked in and saw the bar, I sat there because I was dinging solo.  It was only after my eyes got acclimated to the darkened interior that I realized there were two rooms.  It's quite a nice restaurant.

Service was very good.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the lunch special pricing at $11 is higher than other Asian restaurants doing lunch specials and I didn't see anything different about the quality of my lunch compared to other places I've been.

Bobby Q's was on our way back from our weekend trip up north and it was around lunchtime so we figured we'd get something from there to go so we could eat it back at home. The menu was easy to browse through online. I called and placed an order for the three meat combo which would be ready in 15 minutes.

There are two areas in this restaurant. The front is for dining in while there is a separate back parking lot and take out entrance. Service at the counter was friendly and they even offered me a drink while my order was being put together. 

The smell of BBQ in the car was mouth watering as we drove back home. I ordered the combo with baby back ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. For sides I had the roasted corn and coleslaw. The meal also included 2 pieces of cornbread and they gave me some extra BBQ sauce.

All the meats were very tender with smoky flavor. My favorite of the three was probably the pulled pork, followed by the baby back ribs. The brisket was good and they included fatty and lean pieces, but the memory of the superb brisket from Little Miss BBQ still lingers in my memory as one of the best I've had.

The sides were excellent. The roasted corn also had some smoked flavor and the coleslaw was crisp, tangy and refreshing.

Overall it was a good meal and I do like how they have more convenient hours and better atmosphere than Little Miss BBQ. I will be back for more BBQ!",18,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The recreation area allows many things that you wouldn't expect in the Las Vegas area.  There's skiing and snowboarding in the winter, snowshoe trips in the winter, hiking in the summer, and lots and lots of trees.  While it's still desert, the mountains get much more rain, relatively speaking, than does Las Vegas and thus the lush nature of the mountains.

I visit the mountain in various times of the year but mostly in the summer for hiking.  There are many trails.  The hiking can be difficult for many because of the elevation.  There are few trails that start at less than 7,500 feet so you may be gasping to catch your breath and stopping more often than for a normal hike.

In the summer, on weekends, you can ride the chairlift to the top of the ski area and walk back down, ride back down, or enjoy a game of Frisbee golf as you make your way down the run.  

If you're lucky, you can see some of Nevada's wild horses as they roam free in the Spring Mountains.

*************************************************************

A couple of things to remember about the Recreation Area in 2014.

*************************************************************

Due to the Carpenter 1 Fire of 2013, there are several trails and areas that are closed.  These are the Cathedral Rock Trail, the South Loop Trail, the Little Falls Trail, and the Echo Trail.  Fines for hiking in the fire burned area can be as high as $5,000.  It is a federal offense.  Don't be a jerk and hike through the burn area.  You're just impeding the regrowth of the forest and you'll be harming the ecology.  Be a smart user of our shared resources!

Sushiholic was the perfect restaurant to end the 10 review challenge on. We came here on a Wednesday night and it was packed! Despite it being so busy, we didn't have to wait too long for a table, maybe a few minutes. The restaurant has lunch specials from 11-2, an amazing happy hour that extends from 2-8, and then reverse happy hour from 8-close. Basically, the restaurant offers discounted food and drink at any point in time during their normal hours of operation :).

We indulged in some happy hour items such as the monkey brain (AKA stuffed mushrooms), jalapeño poppers, spicy tuna roll, spicy salmon roll, shrimp tempura roll, rainbow roll, and gyoza. All were delectable bites and the rolls had nicely cooked rice with fresh fish, a lovely balance of textures and flavors in each. 

I also shared some regular rolls not on the happy hour menu such as the spider roll, and also had some tonkatsu ramen. The spider roll was presented as four large pieces, with lightly fried and battered soft shell crab. The tonkatsu was average. I loved the soft boiled egg, but the broth was not as rich tasting as others I've had like at Tampopo or Nishikawa. It had a lighter flavor, less of a pork-infused taste with a lot of garlic in it. It was served with bamboo shoots, sprouts, sliced pork, half an egg, sliced wood ear mushrooms and naruto. The actual ramen noodles were decent but I like Tampopo's freshly made noodles as the best in the Phoenix area.

Service was excellent even though it was so busy tonight. Drinks were refilled as needed and plates were whisked away promptly.

I feel that when the animals are treated humanely during their life (not stuffed in a tiny box all their lives and walking around in their own waste) it reflects upon the taste of the meat.  As a result, I'm a big fan of their carnitas.  I feel you can really taste the difference, and if it's a few dollars more for it, it's worth it to me.  When I went here they really loaded up my burrito so I got a lot for my money, and everyone was very friendly and provided great service.  Would go here again!",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I am a huge fan of Baz Luhrmann's movie Moulin Rouge and I also enjoyed his version of the Great Gatsby.  When I saw that this show was opening, I bought a tickets and attended last night.  I was blown away by the talent--great singers, dancers, a fine small band--all making for a very fun show!

There are a couple of things with the theatre that make the staging both good and bad depending on where you sit.

The largest part of the 100 minute show focuses on characters from Moulin Rouge.  before the show begins, Christian's typewriter is center stage waiting for him to sit down and start writing his love story of his time at the Moulin Rouge.  From there, the show mixes parts of Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet and his Great Gatsby.  

Since the show is performed in the Light nightclub, the seating and staging are very different from most shows.  The room is wide but doesn't have a whole lot of depth as it's set up for the show.  There are two runways that come out into the audience and there are stairs in the middle of the floor seats.  Throughout the entire show, performers move up and down those steps and the stairs in the nightclub seating area also.  There is action going on throughout the entire nightclub area at different times.  You have to turn around and look behind you at times to see some action and if you're in a booth facing the wrong direction, you'll have to turn around.  Such are the limitations of doing a show like this in a space designed for another purpose.  My seat was against the right runway and I was very pleased with where I sat!

Songs features from Moulin Rouge are: Sparkling Diamonds, Your Song, Elephant Love Medley, Come What May, El Tango de Roxanne et. al.  The costumes were well done and it was interesting to see Juliet wearing angel wings.

Photography is welcome as long as you don't use the flash.  Video is also permitted.  This show could easily become my new Phantom.  I will have to return and return to enjoy this music and the stories that are so good!

If you have not seen Moulin Rouge, I'd recommend watching it before coming to this show.  If not, watch it after you've seen the show and things may be a bit more understandable.  And note, you must be 21 to see the show.  Unless you're a gray hair like me, you'll be carded before entering Light!

The idea was the chef would send out dishes to highlight the things they're doing at AquaKnox with the new executive chef.  We gathered at 5:30 and then spent over three hours enjoying good company, good conversation, and great food!  

For starters, we got an amuse-bouche of scallop ceviche.  Very nice start with some chopped scallop on a tortilla chip.

Next out was a trio of oysters.  One was an oyster shooter in a great liquid with a kick from hot sauce.  The server recommended we drink it all at once or we'd end up getting too much hot sauce at once.  We all listened.  The spiciness lingered for awhile.  Another oyster was their Oyster Rockefeller with crumb top.  It was very tasty.  Finally, there was an oyster from the Northwest with some house made salsa fresca.  Very nice.

Next up was foie gras with a carrot confit on a Nutella infused toast round.  The ingredients went together so well.  This is not on their current menu.  Foie gras is available as a topping for steak.  They're thinking of adding it to the menu.

Then came the AquaKnox fish soup.  The menu describes it as having Mediterranean tomato-saffron broth, Maine lobster, John Dory, mussels, clams, prawns, Sardinian couscous.  There was Ono in the soup last night and the tomato-saffron broth was superb!  The soup had  a rich spiciness to it and was accompanied by two toast points.

The next course was pan roasted Ono on an artichoke sauce with persimmon and some fingerling potato halves.  The fish was moist, rich, and was just incredibly good.

Up next was their take on surf and turf.  There were two sides to the dish--one with shrimp on couscous.  On the other side was a scallop on a bed of mushrooms over squash purée.  Perfectly cooked with an excellent blend of flavors, this was another outstanding dish.

The next course was a sampling of three of their steaks.  The steaks are wet aged.  The slices were from their filet, ribeye, and NY strip.  The filet and strip were like butter they were so tender.  The ribeye was a bit tougher.  The trio was served with shishito peppers, cooked onions, and mashed potatoes.

Then came the dessert course.  We were presented with a dish with three dessert samples--Banana cream pie served with a caramelized banana slice, banana cream, and Guinness ice cream.  Another was their take on the classic s'mores.  It had browned marshmallow on chocolate with a graham crust.  Finally, the butterscotch bread pudding with brioche soaked in homemade butterscotch caramel.  Absolutely delicious.  As we were starting these, we were brought a serving of key lime pie with two cherries in glass looking candy.  The presentation was stunning.

Not quite done yet, we were brought cinnamon cayenne cookies and shooter style glasses of hot chocolate.  The cinnamon flavor was similar to candy cinnamon which gave a zing to the cookies.  To end, two of us had double espressos over ice and two had hot green tea.

Service was exemplary.  For each course, four servers came together and rounded the table and then placed the dishes in unison.  Excluding me, the group did small wine pairings with each course.  The sommelier expertly explained his selections and described the wines.  My dining partners enjoyed their pairings and I enjoyed my iced tea which was replaced with a fresh one without the need to ask.

A perfectly wonderful meal and I'm pleased to maintain the 5 star level I gave AquaKnox when I first reviewed them during Restaurant Week earlier this year.  A very memorable and filling meal.  Hence my 15 mile bike ride this morning.  Thanks to all those at AquaKnox for making this a perfect evening!",13,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

There are a plethora of drink options from freshly made juices, a variety of iced teas, smoothies, protein shakes, and a soda fountain with agave nectar sodas. Food options include salads, wraps, sandwiches, and bowls. I tried the kale chicken sandwich. It was a very plain presentation, with a circular sandwich bread accompanied by a simple mixed greens salad. The sandwich was decent. The bread (Whole wheat low carb), was soft, but similar in texture to the ends of your sliced sandwich bread you find in the grocery store. The chicken had a light, crisp, breading on it and the taste of the chicken itself was very ""clean"" (i.e., not processed or overly seasoned). Unfortunately, there was a little bit of gristle/cartilage/fat left on the end of my chicken piece. The salad itself was just slightly over-dressed, and while I liked the vinaigrette, it felt like I was eating more dressing than salad when I took each bite.

At the drink station, the iced teas when we went were blackberry/black tea, watermelon/black tea, peach/green tea, and jasmine strawberry/green tea. I tried all but the jasmine strawberry, and my favorite was the light, refreshing taste of the watermelon tea. Agave sodas included strawberry rhubarb, cola, root beer, and lemon lime.

It came out in a few minutes, filled to the brim with marinated chicken breast, onion, mixed greens, tomato, and a hearty layer of tzatziki sauce. The chicken was tender and the vegetables fresh with a soft, warm, fluffy textured pita. It was so big it wouldn't really fit in the ""Gyro"" paper sandwich holder that came with it.

The fries were crinkle cut and were cooked well. There is a soda fountain with Pepsi products, Dr. Pepper, diet Dr. Pepper, and various iced teas to the side.

We were seated where we could watch the people walking by to/from destinations in the MGM restaurant row area. We then began a marvelous culinary evening of Chef Pinisetti's dishes.  We tried the following items:

Caprese with fresh bufala mozzarella
Grilled Mediterranean octopus
Beef carpaccio
Prosciutto with fig marmalade and bleu cheese mousse with flatbread and arugula
Raviolini--short rib filled small ravioli with vegetable confetti and black truffle cream
Morel and summer truffle carbonara with poached egg 
Maine lobster gnocchi with wild mushrooms and black truffle sauce
Branzino with rainbow chard
Kurobuta pork shank with polenta and vegetable confetti
Cioppino with calamari, Manila clams, scallops, prawns, mussels and half lobster with housemade spaghetti
Braised short rib with orange gremolata, Yukon gold potato purée, Cipollini onions, and baby carrots
Limoncello espuma
Vanilla buttermilk panna cotta with spring berry compote
Espresso ""crème brûlée""--salted caramel and vanilla whipped cream, hazelnut streusel and caramel brittle
Amarena cherry Black Forest cake
Bombolini with Nutella sauce and cranberry jam

We started with a nice bread basked of epi and focaccia served with a tomato basil butter and unslated butter rounds. Good epi and the tomato basil was rich in flavor and worthy of taking bread and wiping every last bit of it out of its holder.

The standouts for the appetizer course were the prosciutto with fig marmalade and bleu cheese mousse, and the beef carpaccio. The caprese and octopus were also top notch.

Moving on to the pastas, all three were excellent. The beef short rib raviolini was melt in your mouth good and the short rib gave the raviolini a wonderful flavor. The lobster gnocchi were as soft as can possibly be made and the morel and summer truffle carbonara were exceptional dishes.

Moving on to the meat course, the pork shank and the braised short rib were the stars. Meat coming right off the shank, tender and flavorful and the short rib was so full of flavors. Even as leftovers two days later, the dishes shone!

Finally, the limoncello espuma was my pick of a favorite. The other four were all good. What a great way to end a stunning meal.

You can find some hard to find, high end items and the whole feel of the store is upscale from the perfect rows of produce to the check out clerks who wear ties to scan and bag your items. This location has a nice selection of ready to eat fresh packages foods, a pizza bar, salad bar, sushi station complete with sushi chef, just to name a few of the prepared foods available. 

The prices are at a premium, even for the same type and brand of everyday item you would find for 40% less at a typical grocery store like Fry's. The produce is priced similarly at a premium but I can understand the higher price is justified because each and every fruit or vegetable looks to be guaranteed fresh and good quality, eliminating the need to go rummaging around a produce bin for the best produce. 

Some of the more exclusive items I found here were Kona coffee, jars of chopped truffles, and a bottle of aged Balsamic vinegar for $200 enclosed in a special glass case.

The burger was well done and was topped with some fresh onions and the cheese.  It was  a fairly standard burger.  The fries were good.  The star of lunch was the root beer float--a mug of cold root beer with soft serve added to the 2/3 full mug to bring the liquid up.

I liked that the machaca had veggies in it such as tomato and onion, but I couldn't taste much of the machaca in the burrito, and the flavor of the other ingredients tended to drown out the beef.

They also have your standard fare such as enchiladas, various burritos, tacos, as well as menudo.

The singer who was the wedding entertainer was quite good, and there was a mix of music to please all ages.

All the food I had was excellent.  I had lobster tacos, the prime skirt steak, and the jelly donut munchkin holes for dessert.  These get high marks in my review.  The tacos were luscious--the guacamole served with them was excellent!  The skirt steak was served with two sauces that were also very well done.  The munchkin jelly donut holes were really tasty with or without the vanilla sauce that came with them.

Now for the minuses.  I had no bread service.  Evidently, if you order from the prix fixe menu, there is no bread service.  I didn't notice this until I was almost finished with my steak, so I didn't bother to ask then.  The steak came with two thin waffle potato chips.  That's it--no side of any kind, not a carrot slice, one broccoli floret, nothing!  I found it amazing when the server suggested I might want to order a side so I had enough to eat.  I did order a side of mashed potatoes at $8.  That sort of negates the prix fixe of early dining.

When I first arrived the waitress brought me a ""new"" prix fixe menu at $59.99 that I should consider as it would entail more food.  This is not on the Mirage website.  I did notice there was more food served including sides.  It seems to be a bait and switch scheme, but maybe no.

I considered giving Stack a 2 rating but the food was all so good, I just couldn't.  I do know I won't be returning here.

The store was having a 50% off sale which allowed me to indulge in some private reserve ribeyes. The marbling on the steaks looked too amazing to pass up! They were also having a buy 1 get 2 free sale on selected items so I got some tenderloin tips, beef pot roast, and brisket burgers. So far I've tried the pot roast and ribeye steaks.

The potroast came preseasoned in a bag. I decided to add some Omaha Steak brand mixed vegetables ($2.99 on sale) for an easy meal. The instructions were simple and it was a quick meal to bake in the oven with no prepwork. The potroast was tender and flavorful. The vegetables were decent, but were understandably a little mushy since they were frozen. 

I followed the instructions for grilling the private reserve steaks, grilling first, then finishing it in the oven. The meat was tender and juicy with good flavor. 

Mannie and Jon provided excellent service. Jon even carried my mountain of meat to my car for me. What a gentleman!

Overall the meat products they have here are good, but the price (Even on sale) is too prohibitive for me to buy from them on a regular basis. The beef here is corn and grain fed, and I would personally rather pay higher prices than normal for grass fed beef instead.",15,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Two of us had the chicken wrap which in this case is fried chicken in a tortilla with lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing.  It was very good!  The only change I'd make would be to use regular grilled chicken, not fried, but the fried did give the wrap a nice crunch.  It was served with steak fries.  The third person in our group had the tuna melt, also served with fries.  She was very pleased with her sandwich.

For dessert, we splurged.  We had passed on an appetizer to go for the good stuff at the end.  We opted for a slice of carrot cake (it's huge!) with a scoop of ice cream.  The cake was excellent and it was the perfect sweet tooth ending to our lunch.

We went here for the early Jackie Kashian show and browsed through the menu. There was a fairly wide range of mixed drinks, as well as your standard spirits and beers. The mixed drinks ranged from around $7 and up. We checked out the menu online ahead of time, and were disappointed that it was a very abbreviated version of the online menu at the show, with no burgers or sandwiches in sight. We ended up with the pretzels, fish and chips, and I had one of the club's mixed drinks, a take on the dark and stormy. 

The drink was excellent. It was just the right amount of sweetness, with some carbonation and kick from the ginger beer, and it had a smooth, sophisticated taste. The food was just OK. The pretzel sticks were decent, albeit quite salty (Even for pretzels!), but the fish in the fish & chips was quite industrial looking. Although nice and crispy, it was a rectangular brick of mass-produced fish that was only a step up from what the Gorton's Fisherman could serve you.

Despite the lackluster menu, the show was great! Jackie Kashian was hilarious, and you can tell the owners put their heart and soul into providing good quality acts for the audience. For those that like magic acts, there was a pre-show magic act going around the tables, although with all the din it was hard to hear what the magician was saying!

They offer combination hot pot meals, which are a great deal in that it includes a lot of veggies, noodles, and meat rather than at other places where you pay a la carte for your ingredients. They do have a la carte options though, for those that want a more customized experience.

We shared a lamb hot pot and a seafood hot pot. There were a plethora of ingredients in both. The lamb broth was more light tasting and a little oily. I enjoyed the seafood broth as it had more flavor.

The decor is a mix of contemporary and traditional, with traditional style Japanese wall murals and more modern styled tables and chairs. They've made good use of the small space they have.

They also have sushi, and other Japanese foods, such as takoyaki.

We had the jalapeno bomb ($3.95) to start with and I had the sashimi plate. The jalapeno was excellent. It was stuffed with spicy tuna and drizzled with sauce. It was a wonderful combination of spicy, sweet and savory. 

For my main course I had the sashimi plate ($9.95). The plate was a generous portion of salad, rice, and sashimi. I had 2 pieces each of tuna, salmon and albacore. It was perched on a bed of shredded radish, seaweed salad, with ginger and wasabi on the side. I enjoyed the dish and all its components. The salad was dressed with what tasted like a house made ginger sauce. The cool crispness went well with the warm rice and raw sashimi.

Service was very friendly and we were checked up on as needed.

I spied a neighbor's plate to see that the katsu curries were huge! I'll have to get that next time I want to eat a mountain of food.

Overall, for the amount of food you get for your money, the freshness of the ingredients, and the lovely couple running this mom and pop restaurant, you can't go wrong here!

We walked in and were greeted by one of the staff, which I appreciated. Everyone else working there though, seemed genuinely unhappy and stressed about working here. Going up to the counter to place our order, we asked if we could get half of a pizza one type, and half the other on a single pie. Denied. So, we ordered 2 smaller sized (14 inch) pizzas and some garlic knots as an appetizer. Note that they will charge you an extra $.50 if you use your credit card.

The garlic knots came out first, piping hot. They were decent, and served with ice cold marinara sauce which also was just OK. Out of the two pizzas (Bronx bomber and Margherita), I preferred the Bronx bomber better in terms of flavor and toppings. The Margherita had some anemic looking, sparse tomatoes on it, with a fine dusting of dried basil. I couldn't taste much garlic on it either. The Bronx bomber was more robust with the meaty toppings, red sauce, and cheese. The garlic they used on it was a heaping amount, the kind of garlic you scoop out from a jar that's already pre-diced.

Vy8TOqwxkhj7Bo74e7fWHQ,7,2010-12-21,1,qkEpMO0QqEy-hKrmrsDYww,5,"This is a 6 mile loop hike off the Scenic Drive in Red Rock Canyon.  I like this hike a lot because you experience diverse terrain and plant life.  For much of the hike, you're in typical Mojave Desert surroundings.  When you get to the back side of White Rock Mountain, it's like Red Rock Canyon's hidden forest.  That side is wetter and there are a large number of pinyon pines, juniper trees, and desert plants such as yucca and cactus of various types.  It has a little of everything.

You can start the hike in 3 places, but I have always done this by going to the Willow Springs picnic area and parking there.  Head east, parallel to the road you drove in to get to the parking area.  You'll pass the pictograph hand prints on the sandstone and a roasting pit and you'll soon be on your way ascending to the top of a ridge.  Then down the other side and back up until you get to the White Rock parking area.  If you want, just before the parking area, a side trail goes down the hill to a place called ""The Guzzler.""  It's a concrete rectangle with water fed by the White Rock Spring.  There's water year round and the animals like it.  There's a sign there saying White Rock Spring.

From the parking area, continue uphill.  The trail drops into a wash and then back out and you'll pass the turnoff for the Keystone Thrust Trail.  Don't take that one.  Continue to your left and keep going up.  After what seems like a long time, you come to a saddle.  The view is stunning.  This is about halfway on the hike, and it's a good place to take a break and have a snack.

Continue along the trail and now it's downhill.  All that effort was worthwhile.  This is the hidden forest area and the trail is quite lovely.  It meanders through the trees and desert plants and you see the wonderfully colored sandstone on the back of White Rock Mountain.  The geology along the trail, particularly in one spot where there is shinarump conglomerate, is stunning.  Stop and enjoy and take photos.  

Eventually, the trail joins the La Madre Springs Trail.  If you want to make a long hike out of it, you could do a side trip to La Madre.  For most however, turn left at the junction and head downhill.  The trail meets Rocky Gap Road and you make another left and walk along the road back to the parking area.  As you near the picnic area, you'll be glad your après hike lunch is waiting in the car.  The picnic area is a great spot for Guinness time.

Happy hiking!",11,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

A friend of ours reserved a room for a promotion party, and we came here in anticipation of tasty pizza.  The party started with some crisp salad with a bottle of vinaigrette and garlic bread. Then, came the parade of pizzas.  The whole entire table was filled with various types of pizza to satisfy even the pickiest eater.  The pizza had a very thin crust, layered with various fresh ingredients such as ricotta, mozzarella, sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms.  The pizza sauce was robust and more paste-like (To prevent the pizza from getting soggy I'd imagine).  My favorite of the plethora of pizzas I tried was a lovely ricotta mushroom pizza with fresh mozzarella.  The only slight negative was that it was very easy for the pizza to get cold since the pizzas were so thin, which thus turned the cheese a little rubbery as it got cold. 

Service was excellent despite having a large number of people to serve.  Drinks were refilled fairly promptly, and pizzas were served promptly after everyone had arrived.

Since the pizza is thin, you can eat a ton of it before getting full.  I probably had twice the amount of pizza I normally would eat, both because of the tastiness of it and because of the actual pizza itself.

She said she is picky about her Mexican food since she is from Mexico and a lot of her family lives south of the border so I had to check it out!

This little Mexican restaurant has great ambiance, with its cute decorations and lively, brightly colored walls. The menu has all your standard favorites such as tacos, enchiladas, and burros to name a few. I like how they offer chile rellenos with different meat fillings, not just cheese. They have freshly made aguas frescas off to the side and Coke products with diet Dr. Pepper as well as diet Coke. Note that the horchata is one of those premixed drinks that come from a separate soda fountain.

I had the al pastor burro ($5.50) to go. It only took a few short minutes and was packaged in a small brown paper bag with an enormous serving of tortilla chips, 2 salsa cups, a lime wedge, and napkins. The whole bag was nearly bursting at the seams and it was hard to carry it without tearing the bag unless I was holding it from the bottom but I don't mind, I'm definitely not going to complain about people giving me too much food! :)

The burro was pretty basic, just meat and tortilla. The meat had good flavor, having a salty, rich taste with some bits of pineapple. The chips were decent, and the salsa went well with both the chips and burro. 

Service was friendly and the festive decor makes you feel a little like you're in a tropical cafe instead of the dry desert.

It turns out she had the early signs of a very serious infection, one that we eventually battled with for more than a month, but she is now on the road to recovery.  Luckily we caught the infection early enough that there wasn't any serious damage.

I shudder to think what would have happened if we had waited any longer, because during the infected period her head tilt got so bad that it was rotated 90 degrees, with darting eye movement (nystagmus).  She would often fall down due to lack of balance and struggle to upright herself, thrashing and flailing around.  She developed an ulcerated abscessed eye which additionally needed treatment, and there were days she refused all food, and we needed to force feed her.  It was a very rough and emotionally draining treatment period, but thanks to the early intervention she is eating again and the head tilt is nearly gone.

The Yelp friend who organized the lunch had pre-ordered what we were getting.  We had a table reserved in the back of this somewhat small mom and pop Italian restaurant.

First, drinks were brought quickly when we ordered and refills were constant throughout our two hour lunch.  And then the food started coming.  First up was some bread--classic Italian bread and mini garlic knots.  Very tasty.  Maybe a little more garlic is needed for my taste but good nonetheless.

Next up were some starter dishes.  We got two orders of what they call Lasagna Explosions and 2 orders of Rice Balls Montesano.  There were eight of us and the plates were such that there were 8 rice balls so everyone could have a try and 12 lasagna explosions.  The rice balls were breaded and deep fried with sauce and cheese.  The lasagna explosions consisted of rolled lasagna, breaded and deep fried and served with sauce.  The sauce was very good and it wasn't sweet.  They had the good sense to hold back on the sugar.

Then came the second stage, the pizzas.  We were brought three different pizzas, a white pizza, a Sicilian fresca (Margarita), and a regular cheese pizza.  I had a piece of the white pizza and one piece of the Sicilian fresca.  My favorite was the Sicilian fresca.  Very tasty and thick crust the way I like pizza.  And you could have guessed it by now, each pizza was cut into eight slices so we all could have a slice of each.

The next course was for the serious eating.  We got two orders of sausage and meatballs, two orders of seafood in garlic cream over linguini, two orders of eggplant Parmigiano with ziti, and an order of tripe.  The first two dishes had their meat sauce and were quite good.  The seafood consisted of shrimp, mussels, calamari, and conch over fettuccine in the garlic cream sauce.  I could have had a bit more garlic in the cream sauce.  

Then came dessert.  We got an order of Zeppole and we were each brought a small plate with a cookie, a cannoli, and their three color cookie.  Desserts were very good.  By now, no one wanted to move we had eaten so much.

Service throughout the meal was excellent.

One was Toniann, and I apologize I don't know the name of the other.

This review is for the Restaurant Week 2011 Breakfast.

This was my first visit to DW Bistro.  I've been going to try it but never thought about going there when I was thinking of a different place.  Restaurant Week 2011 gave me a great reason to go.

The breakfast menu (good only Saturday and Sunday) had 3 courses.  The first two courses had three choices each and the third course - dessert - no choice but you didn't need any choice.  More on that later.

For my first course, I chose the DW oatmeal with toasted coconut and cream.  There were fresh berries including blueberries, red and yellow raspberries, blackberries, and some currants.  The toasted coconut added a texture and flavor that made this a great dish.  4/5 rating.

For the second course, I asked the advice of my server and I went with the crab cake Eggs Benedict with spicy Hollandaise and breakfast potatoes.  The crab in the cake was excellent.  The spicy Hollandaise was great, and the house potatoes had a zing that made them very tasty when compared with the normal fried breakfast potatoes.  5/5 rating.

Dessert course -- talk about decadent!  As I said, there was no choice for the dessert course because it was a sampler of four of DW's desserts.  They were: Red Velvet cake, whipped peanut butter pie, lemon-lime pudding with one blueberry (neat presentation for this), and Jamaican black bottom banana cream pie.  5/5 rating.

Service:  My server was Maggie and I never had to sing ""Wake Up Maggie May.""  She was on top of everything including getting me a clean saucer and a clean up from some spilled coffee--without me asking.  She also recommended the crab Benedict because it's not available all the time but my other choice is on the regular menu.  That's what a good server does and Maggie was superb!

A few little minuses - the oatmeal could have been served a bit hotter; what ever happened to spoons in restaurants in Las Vegas?  Do we have a severe spoon shortage of which I'm unaware.  I didn't get one with my coffee, but I didn't need one as I drink it black.  She only knew I didn't need cream.  What about sweetener?; and, the noise level was a bit high for so few people there.  There is little wall covering to absorb the sounds.  It wasn't bothersome, but it was noticeable.

Now that I've been here, I know I'll be back for dinner and another breakfast to try the jerk pork hash.",1,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The original ""magic"" sauce is a teriyaki-like sauce which is nice in that it's not overly sweet like some sauces can get, and the ""magic hot sauce"" is a Louisiana-style hot sauce.

Unfortunately, there's not much around this area in walking distance to eat at except for a taqueria and fish and chips place, and you probably don't want to be walking too much here anyways since it's not the best part of town.

The cafe is cute with lots of small tables to accommodate the lunch crowd. My sandwich and salad were made in a few short minutes. It was a small half of a sandwich with a side salad that consisted of sliced romaine, a few pieces of chopped tomato, and a few slices of cucumber. Dressing was in a small container on the side. While the sandwich half looked tiny to me, it did taste good, with the fresh sliced turkey, light crisp bacon, and sweet cranberry sauce. The salad was also fresh but it was very basic and I couldn't really taste any sesame in the dressing, just a generic sweetness. It was super thick and concentrated so I only needed a small drizzle on the salad. 

The combo lunch is served with a small chocolate chip cookie. The cookie tasted very doughy and was very light colored (No slight browning/caramelization from baking), an indication they hadn't baked the cookie for long enough. As for the BETTER THAN SEX BROWNIE, what was the verdict? Well.... I don't mean to be crude or very harsh, but let's just say the people that unofficially named this brownie should maybe talk to a sex therapist. The whipped frosting really killed it for me. I liked the fluffy light texture of it but it was so sickeningly sweet I could only take a few bites before declaring mercy on my pancreas and its insulin production for the day.

Service was very friendly and as sweet as their desserts. Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with the baked goods here or the sandwiches, especially when there are other options for food in the downtown Mesa area.",25,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The warm up DJ was a lot of fun, and his dancing is quite funny.  Fator's band is excellent and provides superb accompaniment for his singing.

Looking inside and seeing the furniture and the ways our lives have changed is quite interesting.  Heritage Street is a time capsule of how we lived in the Las Vegas Valley.

Make sure you spend time looking at the main museum items too.  Much of this was owned by Anna Parks who was the owner of many of the items that are on display.  Her collection of ""stuff"" from the area is marvelous and her collection of Indian baskets is superb!

Enjoy the County museum.  It's a bit of a drive from the western part of the Valley, but it's well worth it.  While at the museum gift shop, look for a book called ""Asphalt Memories"" by the museum director Mark Hall-Patton.  It's a small paperback book that tells you how many of the streets in the Valley got named.  If you're a Las Vegas history nut, this is just the book for you.

Chino Bandido serves up combinations that allow you to mix and match various flavors, wrappings, and sides in a fast food Asian Fusion fashion.

I've been here a few times, and while the food is consistent, it's consistent in the fast-food Asian/Mexican way, like a step up from Panda Express or Filibertos.

I've ordered a few items, my thoughts as follows:

Chinese bbq pork: It wasn't the bright red color I'm used to seeing in typical Chinese bbq style pork, but the pork was tender, and had decent flavor.

Jerk fried rice: Has hints of the ""jerk"" spice seasoning mixed with bits of chicken and veggies. Mildly spicy.

Hengrenade burrito: This burrito was around $3, which is quite cheap. However, it is tiny! It was basically the size of the palm of my hand. The hengrenade chicken itself had a great kick from the spicy sauce, and had a piquant bold flavor.

Emerald chicken: My favorite entree so far, with tender white meat chicken blanketed with a bright green scallion-ginger sauce. It's somewhat reminiscent of Hainanese chicken.

Pollo Diablo: Deep fried chicken coated with a vinegary sauce with peppers. Although this is touted as a super spicy dish, it was more like a mild-medium level to me.

I've eaten in and takee outee'd, and I've always encountered fast and friendly service. 

Overall, good for a fast food fusion fix.",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Spacious seating is a plus over Teharu, which for some reason always has half of the seating closed off when I've been there. The interior is cute, and the conveyor belts themselves go by at a slow enough pace that you can grab what you want. 

We came here on a Sunday evening, and had no problem getting a seat for 4 people. There were a decent number of people already seated with stacks of colored plates at their tables. The prices of the plates range from $1 to $3, with most plates in the $2 and $2.50 range. The $3 plates that I saw were either cheesecakes or eel nigiri sushi. We grabbed several rolls, some edamame, and 2 salads (Seaweed and squid).

The rolls come in sets of 3, and the size/width of them generally increases with the plate price. Since it's conveyor belt sushi, it's not the best quality, nor did it taste like the freshest sushi, but you go for the concept and to have fun picking out your plates. 

The best tasting plates I had were the soy-marinated tuna (Although one piece did have some gristle on it, but hey what do you expect from a $2 plate), and the banana tempura roll. We tried another tempura roll (non-dessert), which tasted like it had been made way ahead of time since the fried breading tasted gummy and soft.

Our total for 4 people with 2 fountain drinks was a little over $40 with tax. Service was great, another plus over Teharu, and drinks were refilled promptly and the waiters were very friendly.

We hadn't heard of this restaurant before until it got posted on Groupon. It's a decent choice for cheap, fast sushi with friendly service and nice atmosphere. If you're in Gilbert and craving sushi, it's a good inexpensive choice!",5,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We went on a Monday night, and redeemed 1000 points through OpenTable reservations. Since it was a weekday night, it naturally wasn't too busy, with only a few patrons here for dinner.

We had a Groupon, and redeemed a 3 course meal. Despite this being an evanescent deal, the restaurant had the choices for the 3 course menu printed out and posted on a one-page, hard-backed menu like it was a regular menu- very nice touch! 

We started with the millionaire tacos and ceviche. The millionaire tacos were superb, filled with fresh seafood, with a variety of textures and flavors running through the appetizer. I especially enjoyed the use of yuca chips as the shell for the tortilla. The ceviche was good as well, with spicy piquant flavors and a masterfully done presentation, but the added textural component of the millionaire tacos made me a bigger fan of this dish.

For entrees, we had the kobe vaca encebollada (Skirt steak), and yuca-­wrapped  dorado al ajillo (Mahi-mahi and shrimp with garlic sauce). The kobe beef was very tender, and a complex mix of flavors. The blue potatoes that went with it were stunning, both in flavor and in presentation. The seafood dish was excellent as well, from the crispy crusted mahi-mahi to the tender shrimp swimming in a saffron colored citrus-garlic sauce. I particularly enjoyed the use of toasted amaranth to add an extra textural crunch and nutty taste. 

To further gild the lily, we ended our meal with dessert, sharing the crema
 catalana and the chocolate cigar. The crema catalana was an interesting blend of flan and crème brulée (It is in fact the Catalan version of crème brulée). The creaminess of the custard meshed well with the berries and whipped cream, and there was a light topping of candied peeled ginger on top. The chocolate cigar was pure indulgence, and I loved the unique presentation. The cigar was wrapped with a ""Deseo"" paper ring, and they even made candy matches and a coffee mousse dessert to go with it.

Unlike other restaurants where Groupon patrons are treated like they are the scum of the earth, service was impeccable and we were treated just like regular paying customers.

If you have the coin to spend on a good meal, or if you are feeling like splurging and going to somewhere nice, this is definitely a good place to go! The grounds at the Westin are beautiful as well, and if you park in the regular parking lot you get to see a little bit of them as you walk to Deseo.

This is a no frills, Vietnamese restaurant that has all your requisite noodle soups and rice plates. We were deliberating between Hoosier Cafe or this place and decided to go on a more adventurous route since we had never eaten here before and it had good reviews on Yelp.

We browsed through the menu once we were seated and decided on sharing the shredded pork spring rolls. I ordered the #11, beef noodle soup with tofu and vegetables ($6.95) as my main meal and had a bite of the broken rice plate with BBQ pork (#23 I believe, $6.95). After telling our server that we wanted the pork spring rolls he gave us a sour look and asked, ""Have you had them before?"" as if this was an exotic Bizarre Foods delicacy with three heads and eight eyes we were unknowingly getting ourselves into. I replied ""No we haven't"" to which the server remained tight-lipped and didn't feel the need to provide any extra explanation. I'm not sure why there was such consternation? When we got the spring rolls they tasted fine, nothing out of the ordinary! The shredded pork was balanced with fresh crisp greens. There might have been some offal in the rolls but it didn't taste bad or anything. The fish sauce it was served with was a bit too bland for my tastes so I mixed it with some Sriracha and hoisin sauce. 

The pho was a sizable portion of noodles broth, tofu, and vegetables. I liked the broth. It had a bit of an unctuous feel to it, but it didn't detract from the savory taste of the light yet flavorful beef broth. The bit of BBQ pork I tried was good and had a bit of a smoky flavor from grilling.

Service is about what you'd expect from a no frills type place. Our order was taken, water and food served, with no additional follow ups. We paid at the counter.

Overall it's not the fanciest place nor did it provide a resonating tone of friendly service to me but it gets the job done for providing hearty flavorful meals that are reasonably priced.

N9ne has been on my radar for a long time.  I took Restaurant Week to give it a try.  

The bread basket was brought first and it had some good choices. Two pretzel rolls, two jalapeño, cheese rolls, and a corn bread mini muffin.  Along with this was served some butter triangles with coarse salt on top.  There was also a container of spicy sauce for the rolls, too, that was very good.

 The first course was a choice of soups/salads.  I opted for the Caesar salad with a cup of lobster bisque soup.  The salad was standard.  The lobster bisque was very good.  Many chunks of lobster of good size.  

For the second course, I ordered the Delmonico ribeye, a 10 ounce steak with a red wine sauce.  I ordered the steak blue.  The server confirmed that the steak would be cool inside and I agreed.  It was brought cooked a little more than blue but it was still rare and was quite good.  Along with the steak, two sides were served--a plate of asparagus spears and a container of cheddar mashed potatoes.  The steak was tender, juicy, and cooked almost perfectly.  The sides were good and generous.

For dessert, there was no choice.  It's flourless chocolate cake served with blood orange sorbet.  The cake was OK.  It was dry.  The blood orange sorbet was really good.  It made your mouth pucker.

Service was very good.  Iced tea was refilled without asking.  Even though the restaurant was not very full, sound reverberated around the room a lot and it seemed loud despite the few customers.

Your car will be guided automatically through the drying area as well as the wash and rinse which is nice since other automated washes I've been to have a timed dry that you drive your car through. 

The wash comes with free vacuum and there are several stations you can park your car at. The hoses are quite noisy but have a lot of suction power!

The galette had a buttery flaky dough with soft fluffy eggs inside. It needed a touch more seasoning and I would have liked some more mushroom and spinach in the galette. The pastry itself was overcooked a bit as the top was very dark brown and slightly burnt tasting.

I wasn't a fan of the iced latte. It tasted more like iced regular coffee instead of espresso with milk.

I took the pretzel home and had some of it as a snack later. It was super soft on the inside with a slightly crisp outer crust. It came with a side of mustard that complimented it well.

Since I'm in this area a lot I might stop by here for pastries but I'll avoid the coffee next time.",22,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We each had the stuffed chicken breast from the smaller portions section of their menu.  It was a chicken breast stuffed with broccoli.  The broccoli and the chicken had a cheese sauce that was quite tasty.  I had a small salad (choice of soup or salad), the chicken, mashed potatoes, and grilled yellow and green squash rounds.

Dinner was quite good.  The service was outstanding!  Our server was very polite, friendly, and competent.  Even being from the smaller portions offerings, it was a lot to eat.

I like the ambiance of the place with all things bear - even the bear paw print on the napkins.  I wonder if anyone has ever counted the number of bears - stuffed or otherwise - that decorate almost every free space of the restaurant.

We started out with complimentary biscuits and ordered sweetbreads and hand pulled mozzarella for appetizers. The biscuit was soft, crumbly, with a nutty taste and went well with the light, whipped honey butter it was served with. The sweetbreads were lightly crispy in a sauce reminiscent of sweet and sour sauce. The hand pulled mozzarella was amazing with an incredibly soft and creamy delicate taste. The heirloom tomatoes were equally amazing and flavorful. 

All the elements of the all you can eat meal were well executed. The pork had an earthy roasted flavor, the potatoes were creamy with a bit of crunch from toasted breadcrumbs, the pita and sauce were light and flavorful, and the green beans were the perfect balance of tenderness and crunch. The pork and the green beans tended to be a little too salty in some bites I took though.

We were feeling adventurous and ordered the corn sorbet. It was... interesting. The sorbet had a smooth rich texture and tasted like essence of creamed corn. It was good with the chocolate sauce, and had peanuts and popcorn as toppings. Overall I'm glad I tried it but I'd probably order another dessert for next time. 

Service was friendly and warm.

The fish had a herb seasoned breading, and was more tender than super crispy. The fish was nicely cooked. The fries were decent, but I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw.

We ordered:

La Boulangerie--4 breads (pain au raisin, butter croissant, canelé, and kouign amann
Pâté de Campagne
Crudités (complimentary) 
Foie gras parfait
Tarte flambée
Blue crab crèpe
Onion soup
Escargots Bardot
Croque Madame
Hunter's waffle
French toast
Mac and cheese
Parisian gnocchi
Heritage Chicken rôti with mushroom and brioche pudding
Chocolate macaron
Apple tart tatin
Mille feuille

We started with some small baguettes and salted butter.  Of the hors d'oeuvres we ordered, my favorites were the pâté, foie gras, and blue crab crèpe.  The paté had nuts in it that really enhanced the flavor with this wonderful texture.  The foie gras was so easy to spread on the grilled bread and was very tasty.  The gelée topping the foie was thin and didn't inhibit the flavor of the foie from coming through.  I was less than impressed with the escargots.  The presentation is very clever--encasing the snails in puff pastry--but I am more a traditionalist and like them oozing butter as you remove them from shells with lots of butter and garlic. 

On to more main course items, the French toast was the star.  This was thick brioche soaked in custard and done to a beautiful brown color.  Served with chive mascarpone and some candied almonds it was simply superb!  Soft, flavorful, and decadent.  The heritage chicken and a nice crispy skin and the chicken was very moist.

Always the fan for desserts, my favorites were the chocolate macaron, large in size, with melted chocolate drizzled over the top before dividing and the mille feuille with wonderful pastry filling between the flaky layers.

Like typical fast food Chinese places, they use an ubiquitous ""brown sauce"" base in most of their entrees which they add an extra ingredient here or there to make it a ""Szechwan sauce"" or ""garlic sauce"".  As for the quality, just OK.  I had an order of egg drop soup that was the most gelatinous soup I had ever seen.  When your plastic container of soup jiggles when you move it rather than sloshing around, and when your soup sticks to your spoon and after some effort, lazily drips down when you turn the spoon upside down, you know you've put too much thickener in your soup!  In addition, I had a fountain soda from here once instead of the soup, and it tasted pretty flat.  So, it's not the best Chinese food out there, but it's a good deal for what you get.",0,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

First, the bread basket they bring you has a trio of breads from which to choose.  There was sesame lavash, raisin bread, and regular sliced French bread.  With it, they brought butter that had some olive oil on it to give it extra flavor and they ground sea salt on the butter.  Yay!

The steak was exactly the way I like it--charred and cool inside.  Just walk the cow through the kitchen!  On the plate were some small greens making a small salad, a small broiled tomato half, and a grilled pearl onion.  I ordered for a side the tater tots with bacon and cheese.  These little critters are excellent.  Grated potato formed into small barrels around some bacon and cheese and then fried.  Delicious!

I ordered the chocolate soufflé for dessert at the beginning so my server would have the chef start it as I was nearing the end of my steak.  I needed to get to the other side of Las Vegas for a show, and I was beginning to worry about the time I had to get there.  It turned out to be fine.

The wait for the soufflé was well worth it.  There was a rich chocolate flavor and with the soufflé there was a small pitcher of chocolate sauce with small round chocolate crisps.  I opened the soufflé and poured in some of that good sauce.  The whole thing is highly addictive and may be on a controlled substance list somewhere.

My server was Leon and he was great.  Someone was there to refill iced tea, refill my water glass or remove dirty plates.  The room is very modern and I sat at a window table on the side and enjoyed watching the folks below who were coming back from the pool.

Blfn30Y8tvYq903oLiIf3g,3,2013-05-27,2,9Y9nZbrEk-PBDHiQ8ildoQ,3,"Butterfly Wonderland just opened up May 25th, and there were a lot of families and couples lined up to experience America's newest and largest butterfly conservatory. 

Admission is about $19 for each adult, with senior and student discounts. When you enter, you have the choice of seeing the 3D movie or moving onward to the next room. The movie is around 15 minutes, and shows off the 3D views and pretty imagery rather than a lot of informative discussion about the monarch butterfly.

After the movie, you enter a room that showcases the different pupae that are in the process of transforming into a butterfly. Since there was a large crowd when we went, there was a little bit of a wait for patrons in the actual conservatory to exit before more could enter.

The actual conservatory is a photography student's dream. The landscape is a bit ethereal as various butterflies flutter by you. Some may even land on you for a quick second before taking off again. Although we did have a guide to the different species of butterflies in our brochure, there wasn't much else in terms of education about the different butterflies.

The next section after the conservatory shows a honeybee colony and several ant colonies. The ant colonies in agar were lighted up with neon, making it look like the ants were having a rave. It was cool to see the honeybees, with the queen marked with a green dot to differentiate her from the other bees.

There is also a set of nice aquariums, and a touch pool with stingrays. The aquarium was a weird addition to a butterfly conservatory I thought. The fish were all freshwater common species you could find at your nearest Petsmart (e.g., African cichlids, various gourami, neon tetras). There were a few signs listing the species, but not all the aquariums were labeled. Like the butterfly section, the stingray and fish section didn't have a lot of educational information in them. 

It took us about an hour to browse through everything. The experience here is nice, but it's more of a visual experience rather than a learning one. Some things that might be good for the exhibits are more information about butterfly conservation, why the different species of butterflies are differently colored, and how different cultures view butterflies. Since there are so many children that visit the conservatory, it would be nice for them to be enticed to learn about nature in addition to the visual interactive beauty of the butterflies.",6,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Yesterday, it seemed finished.  There were a number of cooling areas where there are hanging misters so the 100 degree heat is more tolerable for those not used to triple digit temperatures. It isn't a standard park--something with grass and perhaps swings for kids.  Rather it's a place to sit in several areas and I was pleased to see some people playing a game of bean bags and enjoying themselves for what the place is supposed to be.

In the center is the sculpture Bliss Dance.  I need to stop by at night and see it lit.  I saw it on the news but I need to go back and see it in person.
  
It's also meant to deliver traffic to the restaurants and bars that line the south side of the Park adjacent to the NY NY Hotel and Casino.  If you're walking from a Strip hotel to the new arena for an event, this is one way of getting there.

While normally I'd rate this 3 stars, I really liked the vibe last night and I'm sure the Park will become a more welcoming place as it matures and as the weather cools.",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw,11,2015-08-24,5,b5pVrzCPl-64CK1d4--Aug,5,"For about three hours, ten or so of us got a lesson on the history of pizza making along with a live demonstration of how to do some by Metro Pizza chef/owner John Arena.  He teaches a semester course at UNLV in this same subject so we got the condensed version.  During the time we were there, he shared with us some history, methodology, good stories, and great food.

Food items we tasted:

Meatball sliders
Pompeii pizza
Sicilian pizza
Grilled pizza with razor clams
Bruschetta with sausage, peppers, and caramelized onions on Semolia
Pasta pie
Steinbrenner calzone
Modesto pizza with sliced mozzi
Brioche gelato--pistachio gelato in brioche buns

There was not one thing I ate that didn't register a high mark from me.  The meatball sliders were moist and the buns were topped with garlic.  Learning how the Pompeii pizza was made thousands of years ago--pre-scoring the dough before baking and then topping it after baking--was very informative and the pizza was quite good.   

If I had to pick standouts for the evening, I'd go with the Sicilian pizza and the Steinbrenner calzone.  I like thick crust pizza and the Sicilian here is a thick crust that is soft and not crunchy like some I've had.  Chef Arena described the fermenting of the dough and the twice baking so the dough is soft and the ends are blistered.  The calzone was one of the lightest calzones I've had.  It had very little dough and a proper amount of filling.  This was not a lot of dough with a little filling but the opposite.

Our group had this private lesson and pizza tasting in the Lulu's Bread and Breakfast section of the building.  Helping out with the breads was Chef Chris Decker.  

This was a wonderful evening.  While our selection of foods and Chef Arena's lesson are atypical of the normal customer at Metro Pizza, I know that the food is excellent.  It's excellent because of the years of experience Chef Arena has making pizza.  With that experience, he has learned a great deal.  His passion for his craft comes out in both his class and the taste of his food.  We had the good fortune to be taught by a master pizza maker!",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

This three course meal was very good.  The restaurant is beautifully appointed and the service is absolutely top notch.  Everything is done well!

First off was an amuse-bouche of ahi tuna with crispy wonton.  Delightful.

Course 1:  Salt and pepper shrimp.  Three large prawns, wok fried, with garlic and sauce and served in three lettuce cups.  Very tasty.

Course 2:  I opted for the wok fried prime filet of beef with pepper sauce.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  Served with the main course was some baby bok choy and a little oval of sweet potato and a small bowl of steamed rice.

Course 3:  Honeydew melon tapioca.  This is coconut tapioca infused with honeydew and served with an oval of mango sorbet.  This was a very refreshing dessert.  It was very light and very tasty and an exceptional way to end the meal.

Kathy, my server, was top notch.  I watched as she rolled the pancakes for a whole Peking Duck and she was a master.  You certainly can't beat having the Fountains of Bellagio right outside your window.  Several of the servers wore gloves.  Everything was great!",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Xg7gOJjwtzmFGBxtSfOBlA,24,2017-04-05,18,SJdgd-0z2NoURIJ8iqOLIw,2,"This restaurant is interesting in that it shares the same building as Pho Bamboo next door. There is an open space between the separating wall and all the cooking seems to be done in the kitchen at Pho Bamboo. I stepped in for a late lunch and was the only person in the restaurant. There was no one on the Green Lotus side but a server, an older woman speaking Vietnamese, was talking on her phone on the Pho Bamboo side. I browsed at the menu while she ended her phone call and came over to seat me. She then asked ""Are you Vietnamese?"" which I replied I was not, then was handed a menu. Afterwards, looking at the menu photos on Yelp from this restaurant I realized that there were actually two menus, a Vietnamese menu and the Americanized food menu that I received. The Vietnamese menu was in both Vietnamese and English and I was a little annoyed that I wasn't given the option of both the Vietnamese and Americanized menus. After reading a few other reviews, other people that aren't Vietnamese received the Vietnamese menu so why was I excluded? Just because I'm not Vietnamese doesn't mean I don't want food just like how native Vietnamese eat at home, especially if I can read the menu! 

I went with the lotus shoot salad, an item apparently on both menus. I love lotus root so I was excited to try both the namesake of the restaurant and a different part of the lotus plant. It was made in a speedy amount of time and looked excellent. It had a copious amount of crushed peanuts, with lotus shoots, cilantro, mint, whole Thai red chiles, and carrot (Just to name a few of the ingredients!). The dressing was sweet and tangy, and the salad was perched on top of a bed of iceberg lettuce. I liked the combination of flavors and textures and especially enjoyed the crunchy lotus shoots. However, on a few bites I got some thready long white pieces that were hair-like. They seemed like they were some sort of synthetic material, like something you'd pull out accidentally from the stuffing on a couch cushion or stuffed animal. By that time a different person, a young gentleman, had taken over as server, dressed in casual clothes. When he asked if everything was OK I showed him the white thready strings. He paused then said those pieces were from the process of shredding the vegetables. Even if it were a by-product of what he claimed, the chef should have made sure that those pieces would not be in the salad because when I discovered them in my salad it felt like I was chewing on hair or really fine dental floss. Not good eats.

When I got a second round of floss-like thread in my salad I decided to package everything up to go so that I would pick out all those weird funky pieces out of my salad in the comfort of my home. I showed the young gentleman the second round of thread, he looked at it and replied gruffly ""Sorry."" 

My total was a little less than $10 with tax included. It was a huge amount of food for sure, and I liked the taste of the salad, but the weird service with the menu allocation and the unwanted threads in my salad make me hesitant to try this place out in the near future. I'll give it a little bit more time before I decide to try it out again to see if things have improved.

Edit: I looked it up and apparently lotus shoot does have weird white threads when you cut it incompletely. It's still not what you would want to eat in a salad though!",25,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I asked my server about the poutine and she explained the appetizer was large and meant to be shared.  She asked me if I had planned on getting a burger and when I answered affirmatively, she said she could sub a down-sized version of poutine for the fires.  A win!

My iced tea was brought quickly and not too much later, a runner appeared with my burger and poutine.  I have not had poutine before.  I'm not sure how authentic this is with the shredded beef on top but there was some cheese and I was brought a small container of gravy to pour over the fries.  They were OK.  I think I need to be closer to Canada to get the real thing.

I was brought the bread basket shortly after getting my iced tea delivered.  The selection was nice.  I only had one multi-grain roll because I wasn't there to fill up on bread.

For starters, I got the onion soup.  It was a hearty beef stock with just the right amount of cheese on top.  I didn't have to have to break my way through a cheese avalanche to get to the soup.

For the main course, I got the 12 ounce filet and I had them Oscar it.  That adds lump crabmeat and asparagus to the steak.  When served, the waiter brought a small sauce boat of Bérnaise that he ladled over the crab.  There was a small grilled whole tomato and a yellow pepper on the plate.  I got a twice baked potato as a side.  The steak was cooked black and blue as I ordered and it had a good flavor.

Last, dessert.  I ordered their signature banana cream pie.  It was very good.  Instead of a graham cracker crust, they used chopped peanuts for the crust and there are a few peanuts dropped onto the whipped cream that topped the pie.  

Service was good.  Iced tea was refilled without asking.  My one test of service was a fail.  After I out the artificial sweetener in my iced tea, I always twist the small paper packet and leave it on the table.  Good service always notices this and removes the empty packet.  Last night, the packet was left there three times.  It's an obvious thing to remove it but they just didn't.

I enjoyed the hour and a half I spent here.  I wasn't rushed, the food was good, and it's a classic steakhouse with striped wall paper, wood railings, and brass lights.  Dark and cozy is also a good description.  It got quite noisy when two large groups came in, but once they started getting some food, they quieted down.",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The menu allows you to pick out your protein/base item and then what style you want your meal in. Meats included various styles of beef, chicken, fish, and shrimp, and there was one vegetarian option. After browsing through the menu I went with the rolled tacos with Baja style fish. Note that when you get the rolled tacos the meat/base item you pick out will not be inside the taco. The tacos are premade and filled with mashed potato and cheese and they will put your base on top of them.

My order started with a generous carpeting of romaine lettuce on the bottom of my bowl, then the rolled tacos, fish, and then whatever toppings I wanted. I had pickled onions, roasted corn, tomatoes, cheese, and chipotle sauce. I also had some guacamole for an extra $1.35. Off to the side next to the fountain drinks there is a salsa bar with green and red salsas, listed in terms of heat level. My personal favorites were the two green salsas which were ""hot"" and ""very hot"". 

The rolled tacos were a delicious combination of flavors and textures. I loved the light crispness of the deep fried tortilla with the soft creamy mashed potato filling. The delicate flavor of the white-fleshed fish contrasted with the bolder flavors of the pickled onions and chipotle sauce. The guacamole was very good and went well with the fish and tacos as an additional cold and creamy tasting component to the dish. It was actually such a filling meal with just the rolled tacos that I will probably order this without any protein for next time!

Service from the lady cooking my food and adding my mix-ins was dour, but everyone else working there seemed pleasant.

I didn't see any aguas frescas available in the beverage area but they do offer Coke products at the soda fountain and there is a small fridge offering Jarritos sodas and bottled water.

I went inside and ordered the Box combo which is four chicken strips, some fries, cole slaw, a piece of Texas toast and a regular size drink.  

After ordering, I was given a paper cup for my drink and there was some ice put in the cup before giving it to me.  I took a seat and I watched as almost every person dumped their ice into the grate on the Coke machine.  At one point, an employee brought a pitcher of hot water and melted the ice that had been dumped there.  The ice machine was working so I don't understand the need to give you a cup with some ice in it already.

In a brief time, my name was called out and I indicated where I was and the basket was brought to me.  The chicken tenders were cooked well and the chicken was very moist.  The fries are standard--nothing special.  The cole slaw is OK.  For me, they could leave off the Texas toast.  It's a thick slab of bread that's been buttered but it tastes like a big slab of partially frilled white bread.  All that being said, I am a fan.  The price point is good.",13,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I looked at the online menu and then went to this location which is near where I live.  I got the avocado club hamburger for myself and the truffle mushroom burger for my wife.  After finding out what Smash fries were, I got an order for each of us.

Sarah was the woman running the register last night and she was good answering my questions.  I'm sure she could tell it was my first time there.  She told me to have a seat and she'd bring the to go order as soon as it was ready.  In about 5 minutes, the order was ready.  Since there was no one else in the restaurant, I knew it was mine.

A short drive home and we were enjoying the hamburgers.  They were good for a change.  They are somewhere in the middle between normal fast food hamburger chains and the upscale hamburger shops which have sprung up around Las Vegas.  The fries were good.

I went to the Quad last night, November 22, to see the Headliners 2013 in the Q Theatre.  First, with the construction of the Big Wheel and Project Linq, finding a way in can be a challenge. Once I got to the garage, there was a large stream of water flowing through from just two days on light but continual rain.  Imagine if it had been a sudden thunderstorm.  This parking garage, aside from the constant flooding, is a joke.  Even on the first level up, there was a large amount of standing water.

Once I got into the casino, I saw that they have redone some of it quite nicely.  There is still a large sectioned off area where renovation continues as it changes from the Imperial Palace to the Quad.  There's nice new carpeting and new tile in the casino area.  

The showroom is the same as it always has been.  There are just some new signs with the new red lettering and fonts.

While the place has been gussied up some, this is still not a casino that would be a destination for me.  For a show, I'll come here.  Other than that, no.",10,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

For each new client there is an online intake form you can fill out where you list your basic information, medical history and what ailments you wish to have treated for your appointment. The room is relaxing and peaceful but set up more like an upscale version of a community acupuncture room, with comfortable zero gravity chairs that have an automated massage option and privacy curtains in between chairs. 

I had never done acupuncture before so I didn't really know what to expect. My acupuncturist was Kiya. She was very nice and skilled with the fine art of the medical needle. For most of the acupuncture areas I barely felt anything but for a couple of the more troublesome spots I felt a small pinch that went away after a second. One spot did have some recurring mild throbbing that lessened after Kiya patted my arm a few times.

While you sit in the super comfortable chair, practicing the art of being a human pincushion, you can glance at the soothing TV screens showing ultra high def images of the beach or other serene nature scenes, or you may simply close your eyes and meditate on the finer aspects of being a temporary porcupine. 

After the treatment was over my ear did gush some blood after a needle was taken out. Drip, drip, dribble... It was quickly mopped up with some towel and the bleeding soon went away after that initial needle withdrawal. Let's just say don't wear your Sunday best to an acupuncture session. Luckily none got on my shirt!

Everyone here was very friendly and when we were done with your appointment the lovely front desk person made us a tea of our choice. There were about 3-4 choices of tea when I was here and you can have it iced or hot. The tea I had was a cool calm and refreshing beverage.

The normal cost is $59 for a walk in session, with discounts for signing up on a monthly plan. I'd love to come back again but due to location which is far from where I live I may have to put future appointments on hold for now. If you live in the area though it's a good choice for pain relief therapy, or for even lowering high blood pressure and treating allergies.",23,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I made reservations as a Yelp friend had recommended well in advance of the date I wanted.  I had a ticket to see 'O' at 7:30 and this was one of the Bellagio restaurants that I never went to and also one that opens at 5 giving me plenty of time to enjoy dinner and not worry about making the show on time.

I was seated promptly after a few parties ahead of me.  I was taken to a side room in the front--not one of the coveted center tables directly overlooking the fountains--but it was a really nice room and I could see much of the fountain show in any case.  My servers were Team #18.  I'm not sure if the waiter gave me his name or not.  If he did, I missed it.  He asked about drinks, gave me the menu, and explained some of the things on the menu.  I was also brought a nice selection of bread and some butter.  The bread had been warmed nicely.

I started with the tomato gazpacho.  The bowl had several groupings of avocado, celery, some peanuts and other goodies.  Onto this vegetable grouping, the server poured the cold gazpacho.  He then ground some fresh pepper on the soup and I was off enjoying the first course.

For the main course, I got the 14 ounce filet with bone in cooked barely--blue.  It was accompanied by two shishito peppers.  I also got a side of gratin dauphinois with Comté, a gussied up name for potatoes au gratin.  When I saw Comté, I knew this was it.  It's the kind of cheese I always buy for eating at home.  The steak was done exactly the way I like.  The potatoes were excellent.  A very pleasant side dish that I almost finished.  With the steak, the waiter brought a platter with three sauces, peppercorn, a classic Béarnaise, and their house soy, rice wine sauce.  Of the three, I liked the soy, rice wine the best but I used it sparingly.  I'm generally a purist when it comes to steak.  It really doesn't need a sauce.

For dessert, I got the coconut soufflé with chocolate sorbet.  The plating was beautiful.  The soufflé was perfect and the round of sorbet on a small bed of toasted coconut was a perfect accompaniment.  

Now as to service--it couldn't have been better.  It was top notch.  The server was a friendly gentleman and the bus person was quite efficient.  I had a fresh glass of iced tea before I finished the first one.  The plates were cleared promptly and when my server said the soufflé would only take 7 minutes, he was correct.

The maitre d'hôtel came around twice during the meal to check how things were and we chatted for a bit.  It was a grand meal and I'll be returning.  This would be a great anniversary dinner.  I think I'll make the reservation soon!",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The chicken strips were great!  The French fries were quite good.  I didn't think the garlic bread had much garlic taste but I may be too jaded by overuse of garlic.  My wife really liked the ranch sauce and the wasabi was my favorite.  For dessert, we split a chocolate funnel cake.

Everything about our visit was really good.  The staff was super friendly, the prices are reasonable, and although it's a really small space we enjoyed dining in.

The acts are quite dazzling and daring--strong men doing amazing lifts and balancing, a roller skating couple, aerial act, and much more.  Think V Variety Theatre meets Zumantiy, with a zany MC, the Gazillionaire, and his peppy sidekick, Penny.

When I entered the beer garden area, open to the public, I was intrigued by the decor or lack thereof.  Bathtubs made into seats, assorted lights and letters to spell the name of the beer garden, whimsical lights--it has a little of everything.

If you know someone who can get you a VIP ticket, take it.  I was VIP last night.  You get to enter a private lounge.  Access is through a green telephone booth.  Once you show your ticket, you step into the booth, pick up the phone, and when someone on the other side picks up, say anything you want.  He'll let you into the VIP area.  There's another bar in there and you get 1 free drink ticket with the VIP seating.  I had a great time chatting with people from out of town.  And, it's a relaxing area decorated in an eccentric manner a bit muted compared to the outside garden.

VIP ticket holders are allowed into the circular building first, so this guarantees you the seat of your choice.  I took a front row seat, and it was great.  Being the 3rd person in the theatre has its perks.  I was also ""picked on"" by the Gazzilionaire a bit.  All in good fun and for lots of laughs--no lap dance from Penny.

The acts are dazzling.  The performers are very talented.  The show is almost exactly 90 minutes.  The seats are wood, so they begin to feel uncomfortable after awhile.  They are also hooked together with lock ties so you can't get a bit more room from your neighbor.  This is because the stage is relatively small and the performers are coming in and out through small aisles.

I highly recommend this show.  What an addition to the lineup of shows in Las Vegas.  At $69 before taxes and fees, this show is less expensive than many on the Strip.  Go and enjoy!",11,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I ordered berry black tea, iced and I got some macarons top bring home.  The gentleman asked if I wanted a stamp card and he spread the cards out so I could choose the one I wanted.  I wrote my name on it and hung it on the wall.  He then told me to sit anywhere and he'd bring the things to me when they were ready.

I sat at a low seat near two primary desks/seats from an old school.  It reminded me of the desks I'd seen for so many years as a teacher when I was in the elementary school.

In a short time, the gentleman brought me a tray with a pot of hot berry tea and a glass with ice.  He told me if I needed any more ice or hot water that I was just to ask.

Later, he came back to ask if I needed any more hot water and I asked for some more ice.  The tea was very tasty.  Serving the tea in the small wooden tray with a leaf and wind up toy was really a nice touch.

Edit:  While I was drinking my tea, the gentleman came over with the macarons I had ordered.  They were placed in two bags with a nice sticker closure.  They are very tasty.  I tried one--all right--I tried a couple.  The chocolate especially stands out.

The only drawback for me today was the fact I was there alone.  This is definitely a place where you want to come with a friend or friends--maybe even sit in the VW canvas bus.  It's a place where you share conversation, play a game, or enjoy a pastry with someone else.

I really like the way the place is decorated.  So many nostalgic things.  Thanks to Paolo's girl friend and Brian for the translation of the name.

The first thing that struck me when we went in was how messy every table was.  At that point, I asked my wife if she wanted to do take out instead, but she said we'd wait.  A gentleman who just finished his complimentary egg drop soup while he was waiting for his takeout, got up from his table and offered it to us.  It was at this time that the woman showed up.  She cleaned off the table and we were seated by the door.

From then, it was a bit of a wait for her to cover the few tables in the place, answer the phone, and give take out orders to people as they came in.  After a fair amount of time--nothing outrageous--she came to take our order.  My wife wanted the garlic chicken.  I wanted the pork with garlic sauce which was listed on the menu as hot and spicy.  She questioned each of us on what type of vegetables we liked.  I didn't understand this, but when I ordered, I guess she assumed we would be sharing and since my wife already had ordered a garlic dish, I wouldn't want the same.  Again, a discussion of what kind of vegetables I liked.  She then suggested I get one of two other pork dishes.  I ended up ordering the twice cooked pork.  I really didn't come for a discussion on vegetables as well intentioned as that might have been.

We got a complimentary cup of egg drop soup which was good.  My wife liked her chicken with garlic sauce and I liked my twice cooked pork, but it wasn't spicy.  And, during the meal, I couldn't help look at the table ahead and to my left where every dirty dish from every other table ended up for a temporary home, but they stayed there during the hour plus we were in the restaurant.  I realize it's a mom and pop operation but when there are only 4 tables, it becomes an issue.

I liked the woman.  She was quite friendly and had a good sense of humor.  If I come back, it will be for takeout only and I'll call in advance.  I think I've sworn off Chinese food in the neighborhood.  I'll stick to Thai food and get Chinese in Chinatown.",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I had an early reservation here because I was going to see Mystère after dinner and I wanted to give myself plenty of time.  I was seated in short order and was brought menus and water.  I ordered iced tea and that was quickly brought, too.

My server took my order.  I then sat for twenty minutes and no lobster beignets were brought.  At the end of that that twenty minutes, a runner appeared with the beignets in a cast iron container.  The container was not hot and the beignets were not hot.  There was some lobster in the beignets.  There was a fair amount of filler, but I expected that given the price.  Before I was finished with my appetizer, I was brought my main course, the Cajun seafood pasta.  This has become a theme during my Restaurant Week meals--courses that run into one another because someone is not paying attention.  I think the beignet was done and was sitting under a heat lamp somewhere and someone realized I hadn't gotten mine yet.  If it took them twenty minutes to make the beignets, that was 16 minutes too long.  

The Cajun seafood pasta is described on the menu as ""linguine tossed with shrimp, crawfish, crab, Cajun sausage.""  There was little Cajun flavor.  There were a fair number of shrimp and a little crab, but I tasted nothing to indicate the sausage rounds were anything near Cajun.  It was regular sausage with not much flavor.  In the end, the pasta would best be described as just OK.

Dessert was certainly the star of this meal.  The individual carrot cake was quite tasty and the portion was very large.  The one drawback was the marzipan carrot--it was so hard I could have hurt someone if I through this at them.

Service was less than OK.  I've mentioned the run on courses above so I won't belabor that point.  This was an OK place to try during RW, but it's not somewhere I'd return.",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The sign out front said 7 days a week lunch specials but I didn't find anything especially appealing nor of good value.  I don't order sushi at places like this.  I prefer nigiri to rolls.  I ordered their crispy chicken mayo bowl with jasmine rice (you have a choice of white, brown, or jasmine rice.)  The rice comes with deep fried chicken, shredded egg, mayo, and sweet soy sauce.

While waiting, I got my iced tea.  I found it strange the cashier didn't know if they had unsweetened tea.  They actually have one of the 4 variety pick of iced teas next to their Coke machine.

In a short time, a runner brought my chicken mayo bowl.  The chicken was crispy and the squeezed mayo gave it a good taste.  My favorite part was the egg in the rice.

After sadly discovering that no Kona coffee was being offered at the Aloha Festival, I had remembered that Infusion was near this area and could at least satisfy our needs for a fine caffeinated brew. The cafe is situated a few doors down from Four Peaks, and has its own small dedicated private parking lot. 

I browsed through the menu and was excited when I saw they had affogato! Espresso and gelato, how can you go wrong with that? The presentation of it was very nice and this is the only affogato I've had that has come with a selection of berries, walnuts, and a separate cup for the gelato and the espresso. It was like eating and drinking a full dessert plate. The espresso itself had a rich caramel-colored crema, a shot of coffee perfection! The intense, almost chocolatey flavor meshed well with the creamy sweet gelato. I also tried some iced mate tea, which had an earthy deep flavor, yet was still refreshing.

Service was outstanding and the young woman taking our order was extremely personable and sweet. 

Definitely stop by here for a great cup of coffee or tea. You won't be disappointed!",17,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We came here for brunch around 9 on a Saturday and it was fairly empty, but when we left around 10:30-11 the restaurant was nearing capacity. The menu is pretty much the same brunch/lunch menu as the sibling restaurant Virtu in Scottsdale, with an assortment of delicious sounding items. We started with the Virtu octopus. It was a beautiful presentation (Just like at Virtu) with amazingly tender octopus, arugula and chickpeas. Unfortunately I did get a bit of grit when I chewed on some of the octopus pieces. For my main course I had the pork ragu and tried some other dishes at our table. The pork was a potent flavorful mixture combined with the rich, creamy polenta. It was a hefty meal and I could only finish about half of it. Other dishes that I tried were the eggs Benedict and the chistorra sausage which were both pleasing to the palate.

Service was good and we were checked up on as needed. 

The interior is elegant, modern, with a more casual feel than at Virtu. Overall it was a good experience and a place I'd recommend to people that want a good place for brunch.",17,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Granted, I'm sure a lot of these instruments are not playable anymore, and they do have stations where you can listen to the TV footage of some (but not all) of the instruments when they are played.  But, I have a constant urge to pluck strings, play keyboards, and pound on drums when I see them laid out like they have been uncovered at an archaeological dig.  It's true they do have a ""touch and play"" section on the first floor, but the selection is limited (I'd imagine because of the upkeep to maintain constantly played instruments that instrument neophytes are trying out).

Despite the overwhelming urge to try out the museum exhibitions, there is a great variety of instruments to look at, laid out by region, with information stands to inform you about the history of said instruments.  Pretty fascinating to see how different instruments emerge in our cultures and what sounds are deemed ""pleasant"" vs. cacophony.  One of the things that I think would make the museum experience more pleasant would be to extend the range of the ear sets they give you, because generally you can only stand in one spot before the headset reception starts to fade, which makes it inconvenient to listen to the instrument samples when there are lots of visitors at the exhibit.",3,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We continued with a mixed mushroom and clam dish, a cook-your-own wagyu beef and vegetable dish, and ended the meal with a lovely nigiri sushi plate.

A nice perk of making reservations here online is that they offer 1000-point Opentable reservations for certain times and days.  This will put you half-way towards redeeming a gift certificate!  

After we got seated and were poring through the menu, we received a plate of steamed edamame to snack on.  They were nicely seasoned with a sweet-salty-spicy mixture.  They currently offer a prix-fixe menu, where you get your choice of 1 out of 3 appetizers, entrees, and 1 out of 2 desserts for about $36.  Our waiter recommended a few a-la-carte items for our meal, which is what I ended up ordering (Go with what the experts know!).  

I started with the lobster potstickers.  They had a nice crunchy pan-fried outer texture to contrast with the ginger-lobster filling.  The lobster was nice and tender, and had a delicate flavor that went pretty well with the sauce and glaze accompanying the dumplings.  My husband had ordered the prix-fixe menu, and decided on the citrus salad, which was served in a beautiful presentation, with bright, vibrant colors, and refreshing flavors.  

As for the entree, I got the recommended misoyaki butterfish.  The butterfish was indeed a tender, buttery melt-in-your mouth texture.  The glaze seemed more heavy on the ""(teri)yaki"" side rather than the ""miso"" side, and as a result it was a bit too sweet for me.  There was a small bed of a pico de gallo type mixture on top of the fish which helped balance out the sweetness of the glaze somewhat, but I would have needed more of it to go with the rest of the fish since it was a limited amount.  The presentation was beautiful, as the darkly glazed fish was perched on top of a bed of bok-choy and forbidden black rice, surrounded by an emerald green wasabi sauce.  I also tried some of the prix-fixe pork shank, which was fall-off-the-bone tender, excellently seasoned with a lovely broth-like sauce.  

We shared dessert, which was the chocolate souffle.  The molten dark chocolate in the souffle was nice, and the cold vanilla ice cream was a good complement to the deep, rich chocolatey hot souffle.

Service was a little sluggish, but friendly.  If you feel like splurging on a good meal, Roy's might be a good choice if you want an upscale Hawaiian experience in Arizona.",4,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I had almost decided before I went to get the curry flavor sundubu.  I asked the woman if their was a spiciness level to order and she asked the chef.  She then asked, ""Do you want it spicy.""  ""Yes"" was my quick reply.  She called that back to the chef.

I sat for a few minutes while I waited for my takeout.  I could see them packing 5 small containers with banchan and then the chef came out with the larger container of curry sundubu.  He asked me if I liked it spicy wiht almost a 'good luck' kind of sound to his voice.

When I got home and had my first spoon of the soft tofu with the spicy, curry flavor, I was hooked.  Wow, is it good!  The banchans were very tasty and I was surprised when I opened the container of rice and found my seafood pancake on top.  Some very nice seafood including a good amount of octopus.

On entering, there's a good-sized sign pointing the way to the right and around to go past the bakery cases to get to the ordering area.

I picked up the menu and looked it over.  I ordered the Langosteno omelette and coffee.  For a limited time, coffee is free between 7 AM and 9 AM with $.75 for a refill.  The woman at the counter put a mug down in front of one of the tall thermos containers with a pump.

I filled my cup, walked to a table, and waited for my breakfast to arrive.  It took a reasonable amount of time and she arrived with the omelette.

The omelette had spinach, tomato, and langosteno and was topped with homemade Hollandaise.  On the side were some purple fingerling potatoes and two slices of orange and two pieces of watermelon.  

The omelette was good.  The potatoes had not been dried and water from them soaked down the plate and diluted the Hollandaise.  In the corner, under the fruit, there was some unadulterated Hollandaise and it was very good.

Onion bhajji
Vegetable pakoras
Aaloo jeeraa
Garlic naan
Chicken fry momo
Dhindo
Tandoori mixed grill
Tandoori roti
Paneer kulcha
Goat bhootan
Kheer
Suji haluwaa
Papadam served with mint and tamarind chutneys (house provides)

The standouts were the onion bhajji, aaloo jeera, dhindo, and goat bhootan.  The potatoes of the aaloo jeera were nicely seasoned.  The dhindo is an interesting dish of millet stirred with hot water that comes out looking like a mound of not so good looking dark mashed potatoes.  By itself, there's not much flavor, but the goat bone soup, mustard greens, and spicy ginger served with it gave it a great flavor--especially the goat bone soup.

The goat bhootan was one of my top picks of the restaurant  The dish consists of goat stomach, liver, intestine, and lung.  The liver was especially flavorful.  A do again dish.  Another pick was the onion bhajji while the vegetable pakoras were good but standard for any Indian restaurant.

The negatives for Saino come from the service and the billing.  We had to ask for water refills, there was a language problem at times, being out of stock on one of the few desserts, and last but not least--being charged for items not ordered and not delivered a fact I noticed when I got home.  The dessert we ordered that they were out of was charged anyway.  We ordered steamed momo and we got fried instead of steamed.  That may have been a language problem but we were charged for both steamed and fried.  We had not ordered the fried.  In addition, the restaurant was uncomfortably warm with thermostat turned quite high and the few ceiling fans not able to keep the place within comfort zone for me.

My friend and I went here for spa week, and booked our appointments online more than a month in advance.  We both got confirmation e-mails for our appointments.  Well, when we got here, my appointment was in the schedule, but my friend's appointment was not!  Despite checking the system for her name, e-mail, and other information, she was not in the computer at all.  Luckily, one of the aestheticians was available for our time slot so she was still able to get a facial done at the same time.

My facial itself was nice and relaxing, but what wasn't so relaxing was having the aesthetician do a sales pitch about their memberships.  ""How much do you pay for facials now?  Are they high quality?  What process do they use?   How far away is the facility?  How would you feel if you could get facials at a reasonable price here every month?""  I also wasn't thrilled that one of the first things she remarked to me was ""You don't have an accent""  (My parents were born in Taiwan and I was raised in the U.S., but since I look Asian apparently this means I'm automatically not American or shouldn't have an American accent?)  She was also chatty, but in a negative way, complaining a lot about her life.  About half-way through there was a nice silence and I could enjoy the spa treatment.

When it was time to check-out, I was pressured again to join the membership.  I remarked that I would have to wait because I have a lot of bills to pay off this month, and I was again pressured to put down a small down payment and then pay off the rest over a few months (Something that was mentioned at the start of the treatment as well).  

The aesthetician did a very thorough and detailed job.  I've never had microdermabrasion done and after the treatment my skin does feel a lot smoother.

It's a good effort at connecting this city with multi-use trails for hiking and biking but there is still much to be done.

I parked my car at the Bill Briare Park but the easiest trailhead would be at Pioneer Park.  The trail begins along the wash on the east side of Lowe's along Washington Boulevard near Buffalo Drive.

From here, the trail follows the wash north and west crossing two busy streets--Lake Mead Boulevard and Cheyenne Avenue with bridges.  This makes for a safer ride.  There are a couple of places where you need to cross streets, but they're smaller, 4 lane streets, with less traffic.  

I rode north until the trail ended at Atwood Avenue.  I'm not sure if it has been extended yet but it is supposed to connect with the Upper Lone Mountain Trail some time in the future.

Opening promptly at 5 PM, I was seated and soon a bevy of servers brought a number of different starters to the table.  First, a large wheel of Grana Padano cheese and gouged a chunk out and placed it on a small plate.  Then came Italian bread, focaccia, garlic bread, sautéed zucchini, and bruschetta with one mussel.  This before any menu was offered.  It was almost overwhelming that items kept being brought to the table.

The captain then told me the specials for the night without price information and he left me with a menu.  I ordered an iced tea which was soon brought and was kept refilled during my dinner.  When the captain came back, I ordered the Stracciatella alla Fiorentina soup, sometimes referred to as Italy's egg drop soup.  For the main course, I got the porcini mushroom stuffed ravioli in and black truffle and champagne sauce.

The soup was very good and very hot.  With the choice of breads I had been brought, there was a wide variety to go with the soup.  A bus person grated cheese and ground fresh pepper for the soup.  The white of the eggs were evident all over the top of  the soup.  Very nice.

The ravioli was good.  Again I was offered freshly ground cheese and cracked pepper and I chose both.  The ravioli were good but the mushroom taste didn't make it.  The pillows were unevenly stuffed and the flavor came from the delicious sauce.  

For dessert, I got panna cotta with orange sauce and very thin rind.  It was a light ending to a heavy meal with all the bread and the number of ravioli that were served.

For the most part, service was good.  However, for a restaurant of this caliber, I would expect them to patrol the table a bit more and remove used sugar substitute packets.  This is one of my tests for the best of service from a high end spot.

The food quality itself was about average. The portions were very generous but the flavors in both the ma po tofu and water boiled fish were not as well developed as other Sichuan restaurants here such as Chengdu. Both dishes did have the requisite Sichuan peppercorn in it providing the tongue numbing sensation that follows after eating it, but the spice level itself was more on the mild side.

Service was friendly but it helps to know Mandarin Chinese here as the woman behind the counter (Perhaps the co-owner?) had a pretty heavy accent.

If I'm in the area I might come here again to try some different dishes but I probably wouldn't order the same ones I got from this restaurant again.

m-_IOYAreUyy_uyK9U3niQ,12,2014-03-21,5,yZ6MKmMXZLb2wv-S_JKl9A,5,"This is an outstanding hike.  I first did the hike in January 2007, and I decided to give it a go yesterday, March 20, 2014.  The trail has changed somewhat with the addition of some switchbacks that weren't there in the past.  The final ascent is also a bit easier.

It took me two hours to reach the summit.  My GPS shows I was moving 1 hour and 39 minutes which means I was taking photos or I was stopping to get my breathing back in line.

Daniel's review has a great description.  The only thing I can add is the photo showing the dirt trail that you have to take to the back side of the retention basin to get to the Sloan Canyon NCA signs and the Black Mountain trailhead sign.  If you cross the spillway of the retention basin, you haven't gone far enough.  

The way back was much easier for me because I find coming downhill easier.  I wear hiking boots with good tread and I tend to dig in better.

One of the new views from the summit is to look to the south and see the three towers to the newly opened Ivanpah Solar Electric project.  You can see the gleam off the towers along the trail when you get enough altitude.  You can see all three well from the summit.

Take a look at the solar plants in the Eldorado Valley also.  The views from the top are great.

Happy hiking!",15,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

There's nothing mind-blowing about the food, it's just a fast food place that serves American food that's been tweaked to suit more Asian tastes. In addition to burgers, fries, and Asian style drinks like bubble tea, they offer crispy fried chicken (AKA Chicken joy! I do give them props for the amusing name) and spaghetti. 

I tried the aloha burger combo and the halo-halo dessert. The burger tasted kind of like a McDonald's burger, except they stuck a pineapple inside of it. The fries were decent, and there's a self-serve soda fountain. Unfortunately one of the diet Pepsi machines was broken and it spurted out carbonated water on your hand in addition to the actual soda in the cup.

The halo-halo was OK, but whatever fruit was in it was very thready so when I first spooned out some of it, it looked like they had accidentally dropped some synthetic Barbie hair in it or something. The rest of the dessert was filled with shaved ice, 2 scoops of brightly colored ice cream, various sweet beans, jello chunks, and red bean paste. 

There's enough seating to accommodate people during busy times, and they play Filipino TV while you're eating your meal.

I ain't afraid of no ghost! Actually I didn't even know this place was haunted when I ate here and I only found out after mentioning it to someone who knows quite a bit about the history of downtown Mesa. 

Ghost adventuring aside, this cafe is such a charming place to sit and relax. The converted home has many rooms to enjoy your breakfast or lunch in, and the patio has lush grounds that make it a welcoming place to enjoy the outdoors while drinking or eating something from their menu. The atmosphere is reminiscent somewhat of what you'd imagine the Secret Garden would look like.

After browsing through the menu I decided on an iced almond milk latte and spinach, cheese, green chile egg bake. The egg bake was premade and took a few minutes to heat up. The center of the bake had soft and fluffy eggs with ingredients that meshed well together. I would have liked some more seasoning but adding some Cholula to the bake helped with the flavor. The edges of the bake were rubbery hard and too chewy for my tastes though. 

The latte was decent and I like how there are multiple options for sweeteners available.

The food and drink were average, but the main stars of the show are the beautiful grounds and adorable rooms here. So go for the lovely atmosphere, and watch out for those ghosty Openshaws!",26,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,9,2014-10-10,8,-ItpO8BuucZFS_Y3KvRmxA,3,"My wife and I went to a play in downtown Las Vegas.  I had been to Pizza Rock for two Yelp events and I decided to come back for a quick dinner and try some more of their good things.

We started with an order of three meatballs.  They were very good and the tomato sauce was great.  I took the serving spoon and ate some of the leftover sauce like soup.

For our main course, we opted to split a Stromboli. We got the Romano's Original 1950.  It had cheeses, pepperoni, sausage, and sweet peppers.  The crust was thin which is a plus but the interior was missing some filling.  The sausage and pepperoni was meager.  There was a lot of cheese inside and the Stromboli was good.

We were pressed for time.  Our server, Shani, knowing this, brought our check before we were done so paying and getting to our show was easy.  In fact, we arrived at the show 15 minutes early.

A big criticism I have is the LOUD, LOUD music.  At 6:15, they cranked up the volume to just one decibel under now you have to shout to be heard.  Is this really necessary?  When I checked their website, I got the same blast of music and I learned to mute my computer before looking at their site.  Too bad we didn't have a volume control at the table.

I may be back, but if I do return, it will be at an earlier hour when they have lower music--I hope.",13,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
Rs8LrwCBRhbn2SSMyHR9xA,2,2013-09-17,1,p6qar1Tr2jrMmuQGOArqzw,4,"This show opened last Friday after being at the small theatre at NY NY Hotel and Casino.  It is now on the mezzanine floor of the Planet Hollywood Casino near Koi at the top of the escalator in what is called the Showroom at Planet Hollywood.  It is not near the large concert hall in the Miracle Mile Shops.  Seating in this venue is triple what it was at NY NY.  I did not see the show at NY NY because I disliked that venue so much.  

There isn't scenery for the show per se.  There are two risers joined by a set of stairs that go from the stage to the two levels.  The risers light up in different colors as programmed.  Other than that, there are four banks of light tubes that change colors.  Except for a few props for some of the dances, that's it.  It's basically a song and dance show and is not meant to be a scenic one.

I had a comp ticket for this show and took advantage of it.  The title is misleading to say the least.  While you expect an evening of dances to ABBA music, only the first 5 or 6 numbers are ABBA.  The rest are from the disco era of the late 70s and the 80s with a little Motown thrown in.  I'm not a fan of ABBA--I wasn't one who liked Mamma Mia all that much, but I really liked the way they started the show last night with Dancing Queen and other ABBA numbers including Fernando.

Then, Avis Ellis was introduced as a world renowned recording artist.  I had never heard of her before but that's no big surprise.  She sang a song of Whitney Houston's that I enjoyed.  She has a big voice and big hair.  I guess you'd consider her the star vocalist because she was only one introduced by name.  I Googled her to see some of her bio.

After Ellis sang, they went into the disco era with an homage to Saturday Night Live and disco music.  In between the numbers, half the dancers were offstage changing for their parts in an upcoming song.

The show lasted exactly 75 minutes and it started on time at 9 PM as advertised.  They deserve a star for that!

A word about seating.  I would not recommend the VIP table seats up front with the small round tables.  You are close to the stage, but you also have to turn around to see some of the singers behind you because they come out on the three walkways built for Peepshow.  Also, you're in a pit-like area, and you'll be constantly looking up.  The rest of the seating is normal theatre style.  I only dislike how small the seats are.  I almost groped the woman next to me just trying to get my phone.

The show is less than a week old and I'm cutting them some slack for some incorrect moves with the dances last night.  There are some new cast added with the larger venue and I think they need more time to settle in.  The show is loud.  I did spend the entire time tapping my foot to the music and at one time I quietly sang along.  I did not clap as performers like to prompt audiences to do.  If you're so good, we'll clap along.  We don't need your advice.

All in all, I thought the show was good and I would go again.  When I leave a theatre with a big smile and have liked the music I heard, it was a good show.  I checked the website and saw that the tickets start at $69.50.  I know this is a large cast, but I wish Las Vegas producers would not overprice their shows just so they can be sold at discount ticket outlets.  Set a reasonable price and sell your own seats and the discounters won't be so needed.",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The show has an 11 piece band that is quite good.  The 6 featured singers do a fantastic job singing the songs most of the audience knows so well.

The dancers are very good.  Girls in showgirl regalia bring back the days of a different Las Vegas when several casinos had showrooms with showgirls dressed and dancing to live bands, a time almost gone on the Strip.  The two tap dancers are incredibly talented.  

Put all of this together and you end up with a very enjoyable show that runs about 80 minutes.  The show is in the Saxe Theatre in the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood.  

I had a discounted ticket for the show.  The website says tickets run in the $90 range.  I'd recommend looking for a deal at a ticket outlet.

Some of the dishes we tried are evolving works for the new restaurant the chef is opening.  This place is so much more than a pizza shop.

Items served:

Bacon candle with crusty bread
Carpaccio
Bacon risotto
South Buffalo breakfast sandwich
Hot Mama
Breakfast porchetta
Pizza-half with pepperoni
Nutella donuts and apple/berry compote
Cookie milk and cookies

Three adults and one youngster ate here and tried some of the newer items Chef Palmeri is working on as he creates this brunch menu.  I'd had the bacon candle before but the dish has evolved so that the candle does not melt as quickly as before and the mixing with the balsamic is just about perfect.  The addition of the salt adds to the dish for me.  The carpaccio was house made bresaola with crispy caper, shaved egg, rocket arugula, and shaved parmesan-reggiano with EVOO.  The bresaola was quite good.  This was a salad with a small amount of meat creating a base.

Two sandwiches really caught my fancy.  The first was the South Buffalo breakfast sandwich.  It was cured and smoked in house pastrami, sharp cheddar, sunny side egg, Naked City mustard on a brioche bun.  Breaking the egg and letting the yolk run down the pastrami amde for a very flavorful sandwich.  The second was the Hot Mama sandwich.  Egg bread, salami, in house lonza, provolone, Alfredo, and sunny side egg.  A wonderful blend of flavors again and very appealing.

Near the end, we had the breakfast porchetta consisting of cured pork belly, Maple sausage, sage, basil, rocket arugula, and lemon.  It was very tasty.

Then came the desserts.  Cookie milk and cookies.  The cookies were quite good but I'm not a big fan of milk so the milk was OK but the dessert would not be something I'd order.  I'd take the cookies and run but not the milk and cookies duo. On the other hand, I could have eaten all the Nutella donuts.  The apple/berry compote served with the donuts was not needed but was very good.

One thing I liked about the menu was that Chef Palmeri listed where almost all items are sourced.  Not only is this informative but it shows you how much is done in house.

I look forward to going back to Naked City and I look forward to the new restaurant when it opens.",17,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

On my first return, service was so bad that it took approximately 10 minutes from the time I ordered a piece of pie for dessert.  My server even walked out with an empty bowl requested by the table next to me and then made a trip back to the kitchen.  You can't carry a small bowl and a piece of pie at the same time.  

I returned last week for breakfast.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict.  The menu describes is like this: ""Poached Eggs Served over Toasted English Muffins and Canadian Bacon. Topped with Hollandaise Sauce and Served with Hash Browns.""  The Hollandaise had to be from a can or bottle.  If it's made in house, the chef ought to be ashamed!  The Canadian bacon was more like two thin slices of ham, and the plating was atrocious.  Someone just took a ladle and dumped the Hollandaise smearing it along the side of the dish and partway into the hash browns.

The quality has gone downhill and it's not worth coming here even if the meal is comped.  I'll go elsewhere.  It appears they didn't work on their fourth star very much but instead went backwards.",18,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Hmm it doesn't have the same ring as Patrick Henry's words but Liberty Market's breakfast platters are quite good! I was in the area and looking for a dog friendly breakfast spot and this restaurant fit the bill. It was a bit awkward having a dog here though due to the ordering system since you have to wait in line inside to order and pay, and non-service dogs are technically not allowed inside eating establishments. I had read a previous review saying that the reviewer was allowed to place her order with a server at the door. When I walked tentatively inside near the door with my dog, I asked if I could place my order with someone since I had my dog with me, but they said I could wait in line with my dog like everyone else. I'm not sure if this is their normal policy but hey, it worked well enough for me.

I ordered the vegan American standard breakfast. It is a well rounded platter with scrambled tofu, avocado, sweet potatoes, mixed greens salad, wheat toast and blueberry preserves. I enjoyed the soft texture of the tofu which tasted very similar to scrambled eggs and the sweet potatoes were well seasoned and were nicely caramelized from cooking. The avocado was fresh, and the blueberry preserves tasted good but were too watery to be able to spread onto toast with a knife. The salad was also very fresh and I enjoyed the flavor profile of the dressing but the dressing itself tasted too oily. 

I noticed as I started to dig into the potatoes that there was something unusual-looking on my plate. I stopped and examined my plate closer to find that there was a bird poop on it! I flagged down a waitress and asked for a new plate of potatoes which was done for me without hesitation. Apparently the chef said that it is a sign of good luck. I guess it's good luck that I didn't actually eat it or that the poop didn't land on my head instead.

I washed everything down with a house-made almond milk which was creamy and refreshing.

Due to the unexpected extra ""ingredient"" in my breakfast I'm not sure I'd dine on the patio again but I'd definitely like to stop by again to try something different.",24,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

There is a Yelp check in offer for free bruschetta but you can't double dip on the coupons--either the Yelp or the Groupon--so of course, we went with the Groupon.

We were brought iced teas and a bread basket shortly after being seated and ordering.  The bread basket was a let down.  The one piece of lavash was more like pressed cardboard and the two types of focaccia were merely OK.  We did not get butter but rather a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I have to remember in Italian restaurants to tell them to hold the balsamic.  It's just to sweet for me.  Give me plain olive oil and a salt shaker.

We ordered fried artichoke for an appetizer.  It was very good.  The dipping sauce was quite good.  There were 6 pieces of artichoke.  For mains, we each ordered ravioli.  I got the Lobster stuffed ravioli with lobster sauce--a house special for the evening.  My wife got the ravioli stuffed with butternut squash.  We both enjoyed our ravioli.  The serving size was just right.

For dessert, I ordered a cannoli and my wife got the vanilla crème brulée.  Both were good.  The cannoli was fairly standard but I didn't taste any of the pistachio nuts that were supposed to be in the cream.  The crème brulée was the winner of the two desserts.

I think Gaetano's is overpriced.  It only makes sense to go here when you have a coupon of some kind.  Service was good.  It was pointed out when the bill was brought that gratuity had automatically been added because of the Groupon.  I'm not a fan of that.

After looking over the menu, we ordered a burrito for my wife with refried beans and Spanish rice and I got a chimichanga filled with carne adovada.  My two sides were pinto beans and calabacitas.  I ordered red sauce--regular spice level--for my wife and I got the triple hot green sauce for my chimichanga.  

We were brought a basket of chips and some salsa that had a good kick to it.  Even my gringa wife is starting to like spicier foods.  Win!

Our dinners came and they were very good.  Andrea thought her red sauce was spicy but she liked it.  My triple hot green sauce was great and it added great flavor to the adovada.  The only minor drawback was we were brought no sopapillas despite the menu saying that all meals are served with sopapillas and two sides.  As it turned out, we were full enough without having the extra amount of food from the sopapillas.

This year, the summer show was scrapped from the lineup.  Instead, the spring show morphed into the summer display with a change out of the type of flowers in the display.  It's still quite lovely.

It's quite interesting to time a visit when they are doing the changeover from one season to the next.  You see the ""shell"" of the Conservatory and how they place the displays so they make up the finished product.

Once you get beyond the Duck Creek concrete trail, you arrive at the Dragonfly Divide.  It's from this trail at the Wetlands Park that you can walk over to the Las Vegas Wash east of the sewage treatment plant and see the water as it makes its way to Lake Mead.

The amount of water that leaves Las Vegas every day is incredible, and it comes through this area where it is cleansed more by the reeds, stones, and the open air.

Although the location itself was very picturesque with the tree lights and nice walkways, it was so crowded on Saturday that when you walked around, it seemed like you could only inch your way from booth to booth.

For instance, while there were some booths that sold fudge, most of the booths were mainly selling some sort of fruit or main dessert dipped in chocolate.  We came here in anticipation of trying out some chocolate dipped key lime pie, only to discover that the one booth that sold it, had sold out for the night.  

In addition, when we were here it seemed like just a big conglomeration of booths, with only some of them selling chocolate.  It seemed like most of the booths were either some sort of non-food good (like jewelry, hair pins, etc) or fair-type food such as lemonade and funnel cake.

I ended up with 1 lb. of black sphinx dates ($11.25), a package of 2 chocolate covered marshmallows with graham cracker ($3.50) and a medium date shake ($4).  The dates were perfect- sweet, moist, with a little flaky texture from the outer skin. The date shake was delicious. It was creamy, with a lot of date bits melded into it.

I'd like to give real stars in the heads of some people who came with orders for large numbers of sliders.  It made the wait quite long, and being about 100 degrees outside, it was a tad uncomfortable with just one small tree with shade.  I will find this truck again and go earlier.

There's a wide array of sandwiches to choose from, ranging from the farm garden sandwich to the pulled pork sandwich. The prices are around 10 dollars for sandwich or salad. The salads themselves are pre-made and on ice in the area right next to the drink station.

For those that are vegetarian, there are 3 different full salads and 3 different sandwiches to choose from, all with distinct flavors. I've tried the marinated portabella, which was decent. Everything was very fresh, and the bread was high quality, but I would have liked to taste more balsalmic vinegar in the mushroom for more flavor. The whole sandwich was a good portion that will leave you full for lunch.

I tried a slice of pecan pie ($4.25). It seems like it's made with freshly shelled pecans, but beware when you chew. Apparently they can get a bit careless with their nut-shelling, because I got a large piece of shell in my pie! (Minus one star, I could have broken a tooth on that shell!)

Set in the corner spot of the same plaza Asian Cafe Express is in (But on the opposite side), Spice Spirit opened up just a few weeks ago. I'm not sure what the space used to be but the interior is quite lavish and beautiful, with a lot of tables and booths. I'm sure they spent a pretty penny on upgrading this area to make it look so nice.

We decided on the hot and spicy cumin fish fillet, dan dan noodles and the chef's special dry chili tofu. The fish and tofu were prepared in a similar way, lightly breaded and fried, then coated with a chili mixture. I enjoyed the light crispness of the tofu, the soft molten creamy center, and the tongue numbing chili spice. The fish was tender, also lightly crisp, with a bold punch of ground cumin dusted on it along with the chilis. The dan dan noodles by comparison were more tame. The noodles had an al dente chew to them with a mound of seasoned ground meat and fresh cooked greens. I was surprised to see fresh vegetables instead of the pickled vegetables I usually see in dan dan noodles.

Service was friendly and water was refilled as needed. Prices were a little high but I did feel like the product we got was high quality. 

As we left the owner was there and he thanked us for coming which was a nice touch.

KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA,9,2017-06-24,4,qTuljh3urimyE1OcbPmoHg,4,"Review is for Restaurant Week 2017 menu.

I have heard from many friends how much they like this restaurant and how nice it is to get a patio table lakeside and enjoy the food and scenery.  Coming for lunch when it was 100+ degrees, I decided to stay inside despite misters and fans on the patio.  The three items I ordered along with their menu descriptions.

Smoked salmon tartine - Avocado, Red Onion, Capers, Creme Fraiche, Country Bread
Chicken picatta - Lemon Capers, White Wine, King Trumpet Mushrooms, Fingerling Potatoes
Crème brûlée

I didn't realize the restaurant was so small but at 1 PM, there were several tab;es available and a few people went outside.  Walking along rows of boxes of wine for sale, I was seated at the end of the booth closest to the store part of the building with a view of the patio and the lake beyond.

The tartine was good and had plenty of smoked salmon.  The menu in the restaurant had picatta in quotes.  I think that's because they didn't serve a traditional piccata with the breast pounded thin but rather it was a regular half chicken breast that was sliced and placed on the accompanying items.  The sauce had a mild lemon flavor and it was rich and flavorful.  The pieces of potato and the mushrooms added to the dish.

The crème brûlée--something I generally skip because if you've had one you've had them all--doesn't apply in this case.  It was some of the best vanilla bean custard I've tasted and the top was thicker and crunchier than I've had before.  It is really good!

Service was good.  I was brought a fresh glass of iced tea without needing to ask and the meal was coursed with just the right amount of time between each course.

This is a return place for dinner on the patio when it cools down.",8,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The breakfast was ready quickly and it was delivered hot.  The lemon flavor along with the blueberries in the batter made for a nice combination.  I did not make a combo of my breakfast.  For $2.99 more, you can get two eggs and bacon or sausage.  That would have been too much breakfast for me.

I read the reviews on Yelp before going here and a few mention cleanliness.  That's something that's apparently not a problem anymore.  The floor was spotless except for some foot prints at the door and the tables were clean.

LYgAf_vpMQU6JqBcTXg-Sw,22,2017-01-01,15,zHpr4op53eS83iujTX0KBw,4,"First review of the new year! We celebrated a 'Q Year's Eve at Bobby Q and left quite full and satisfied! Making reservations was easy through OpenTable, and when we found out we needed to add a few more people to our table I called the restaurant and asked if they could accommodate us. The hostess was so nice and gracious, going out of her way to find a way to squeeze the extra people into the reservation system.

The restaurant itself is right off the 60 and Stapley. You can't miss it when you get off the freeway. This whole street can be called ""Restaurant Row"" due to the number of eateries here! We were offered the choice of sitting inside but waiting a few minutes or sitting on the covered heated patio outside on a high-top. We went with the outdoor seating and it was quite pleasant. The high top chairs were comfortable, and the table was made from a huge piece of natural wood slab, a cool unique touch. The patio seating was also quite nice since the heaters were very powerful and kept us comfortably warm for the whole night. 

The menu offers BBQ obviously, with other options such as salad, steak, chicken, and seafood. 3 of us split the Whole Hog Heaven, a mighty platter with your choice of 2 types of ribs, 2 types of meat, and 3 sides. We decided on the beef ribs, baby back ribs, beef brisket, and pulled pork. We also had the mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and pecan coleslaw as sides. 

The platter was indeed a magnificent sight to behold. Of all the meats I enjoyed the pulled pork the most. It was tender, moist, with a good balance of smoke flavor and seasoning. The beef brisket looked to have an admirable smoke ring and was also tender and well seasoned. Of the two ribs I liked the baby back ribs the most. My favorite of the sides was the mac and cheese. It was the perfect balance of creaminess, cheesiness, with a velvety smooth texture and nicely cooked macaroni pasta. The mashed potatoes had a bit of a sour tang to it that I wasn't a big fan of, but they were creamy and smooth, and while I typically enjoy the pecan coleslaw, our side had a gigantic chunk of cabbage leaf in it that wasn't shredded, not good eats!

Service was warm and friendly. Drinks were refilled as needed.

The Whole Hog Heaven can probably satiate 4 regular size appetites. We would have had leftovers enough for one more portion if it weren't for my husband's black hole for a stomach. :)

Before you decide on dessert, make sure you'll have room for both paid dessert and the lovely free cinnamon sugar donuts they give you at the end. They were warm, soft, and delicious!

Overall, I prefer this Bobby Q over the one in Phoenix due to the location which is closer to where I live. I'll definitely be back for more 'Q!",25,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q,1,2012-05-29,1,1YUNporuv3roarlATYtruw,4,"I came here to give it a try and chose the 3 course Prix fixe menu which consists of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert.  I was surprised by how small the restaurant was inside.  There's more seating in the hallway that leads to the rear tower of the Tropicana Hotel.  I decided to eat inside because there had been a whole lot of people rolling suitcases down that hall and I wanted a little more quiet. The restaurant inside is almost all white.

The bread basket was brought quickly.  A couple of things here.  The bread was very dry, stale even, and the mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar is just the wrong shape for this dipping sauce.  There's way too much olive oil and the balsamic just sits at the bottom.  The basket had a piece of lavash, some focaccia, a roll, and a slated bread stick.  The star of that basket was the salted bread stick.

For a main course, I got the linguini with Manilla clams in a white wine sauce.  There were 10 clams arranged around the pasta.  This was excellent.  I wanted to drink the sauce left, but I used some of the bread to soak up the white wine sauce and I finished it that way.  For those who don't like salty foods, I could taste a fair amount of salt in the sauce.  I love salt so this was a good thing.  Others need to be warned about that.

For dessert, I got the tiramisu.  This was a very large piece of tiramisu different from what I've generally had, but it was very tasty.  On top was a lot of cocoa powder which set off the sweetness beneath.

The prix fixe menu gives you coffee or tea and a glass of house wine.  I got iced tea and instead of wine, I had a cup of coffee with dessert.  At most places, that would cause fits and an extra charge.  Here it was just fine!

I was going to give Bacio 3.5 stars, but shortly after I was seated, Chef Pellegrino had a meltdown with one of her staff--enough so that most people in the restaurant looked where she was and watched and listened.  She was giving grief to one of her bus people for wasting bread.  The meltdown ended with her saying, ""That costs money.""  She walked out of the restaurant for a few moments and then came back.  The show was worth an extra 1/2 star.  Brava!  The service by all the staff was superb!

I do have one complaint.  The French term for your kind of menu, Chef Pellegrino, is Prix fixe as you well know.  Please don't be lazy and spell it prefix like many people do who have no clue as to the origin of the term.  I know it sounds like prefix but don't succumb to dumbing down your own menu because people don't know.

Chef Pellegrino is very talented.  She was working in the kitchen all the time I was there.  Obviously she cares.  I am sure I'll make a return visit!",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I had dinner here on Sunday (1/22/12).  I made a reservation for 4 PM and was seated promptly.  I was asked by the maitre d' for my choice of watching football or watching people.  When I chose football, he showed me to a high top table in the front of the bar area.  Directly in front of me was a flat screen with the 49ers/Giants game.  During commercials, I could look out to the patio in the Forum Shoppes and people watch.

Since I chose this early time, the menu given me was the lunch menu.  I was told I could order from the dinner menu if I wanted, but the server didn't go to get a dinner menu.  It was just as well.

I ordered a cup of Stone Crab Bisque, the 12 ounce New York Strip Steak, and an individual portion of sautéed garlic spinach as my side.  For dessert, I got a half portion of their Peanut Butter Pie with hot fudge.

The soup was quite good.  The cup was just the right size.  The steak was superb!  It was charred on both sides and very rare inside--just as I ordered.  With it, they brought a small container of seasonings--ground salt, dried garlic, and other spices--to add to the steak.  It was great!!  The garlic spinach was also excellent.  Finally, the server told me that they had half-sized portions of dessert.  That's what I got, and it was more than enough to finish the meal.

Two reasons for the 1/2 star deduction from a full five.  One, since it was lunch, I guess, the bread selection wasn't a selection.  I was brought 2 small rolls, something I could buy in any grocery section.  That was quite disappointing.  Also, I waited about 10 minutes before the server first came to talk to me about ordering.  Since I was in no hurry, and I was watching the game, this was no problem.  Still, someone should have stopped by to assure me my server would be along.  It was busy, but not that busy.",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We started with three plates--the Firefly fries, steak and mushroom skewers, and marinated and grilled octopus (pulpo asado).  All three dishes were excellent.  The fries are completely addictive.  You cannot stop eating them.  The have parmesan cheese and herbs on them and a side of aioli for dipping.  I liked them without dipping.  Did I mention they're addictive?  I think the FDA will soon start regulating their distribution and sale.  :)

We decided to try two more things because this is tapas.  I ordered the scallops ""escargot"" for myself and my wife got the ham and cheese croquetas.  Both were winners all the way.  The butter/garlic/herbs with the scallops fooled one into thinking they were having real escargots.  The ham and cheese deep fried croquetas were really tasty and the aioli on them was super.

Finally, we ordered some dessert.  My wife got the chocolate and cherry bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream and I ordered the banana-Nutella sandwiches.  The sandwiches had mashed bananas inside and Nutella drizzled on top and there was a small side container of more Nutella.  Absolutely delightful!!!

Our server was Joshua and he was top notch!  He answered questions we had, recommended some things when we asked, and he always saw to it that we had new glasses of iced tea before we finished the ones we had.  It seemed like everyone in the place was very customer oriented and we felt welcomed and appreciated!

I will be back to try some more of their goodies.  But, this time I'll skip the fires.  As addictive as they are, they can also be very filling and you just cannot stop eating them.  I was waiting for my wife to say, ""Put the fries down and put your arms up.""

I have been to four productions in this theatre.  It is minimal but that allows the directors to taper performance area and seating to be suit the particular production.

There has been a musical like Little Shop of Horrors and a drama--The Bad Seed.  The director of the company has three more shows during the season already planned and there will be more in between as with last nights presentation by UNLV's African American Student Association of Theatre and Film.

The series of three shows is recreating historic Carnegie Hall concerts.  Last night was a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald by doing many of the numbers she sang at the July 5, 1973 Newport Jazz Festival at Carnegie Hall concert.

The place is really well done and a big addition to the live entertainment scene fairly close to the Arts District.  The owner, Ron Decar, owns the Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel next door and he bought and renovated this property to turn it into a banquet hall for weddings in his chapel or elsewhere and it's become an entertainment venue. It's a job well done.  The chairs are your standard banquet type--maybe not the most comfortable, but they're designed for a reception not necessarily for concerts.

One corner of the room has been made into the stage area.  There's great lighting for doing various effects, and the sound system in the room was first class.  It really is a perfect venue for this kind of concert.

Parking was easy in the lot.  It wasn't large enough for the full house that was there last night, but there was street parking.  The staff was excellent.  Drink prices are very reasonable.

This was a place that Guy Fieri used to patronize when he was a student at UNLV.  What more do you need to give it a try?

We got there at 5 and soon two of our friends arrived and 10 minutes later the last got there.  I point that out because there's one table in the dining room that has a sign saying it's reserved for parties of 5 or more.  The waitress knew we were expecting 3 more guests and she brought us drinks.

When everyone was there, we ordered 2 original strombolis and one of the group got a chicken salad but he did try the stromboli.  It's been a lot of years since I ate stromboli in Upstate NY so I was glad when friends from NY suggested eating here.

The stromboli was very good.  It had a thin dough which is something few places do.  I like it the way it was made because you're not eating so much bread.  The filling was ham, cheese, pepperoni, and tomato sauce.  We also got a side of extra tomato sauce.  The taste was exactly what I was used to from my past life in NY.  

Service was very good.  Our server was quite friendly and she had a good wit with our salad friend.  I was so pleased that the smoking bar area is glassed off from the eating area.

I was greeted by the staff at the counter in a very friendly manner.  I was studying the large menu board above and two of the staff pointed to some smaller paper menus at the register.  I brought one of those home with me.  I selected the ""Philly"" their take on the classic sandwich.  You're given a number to put on your table.

The menu describes it this way.  ""Skirt steak, Velveeta, red wine drunken onions.""  The sandwich comes with fries.  I ordered a Coke and I was given a cup for use at their Coca-Cola Freestyle machine.  Silverware (real metal--not plastic) is available at the end of the counter by the registers and there are napkins, straws, and drink container opts there, too.

I had reservations and I was asked if I wanted to eat in their café area or the more formal dining room.  I chose the dining room, and I'm glad I did because I really liked the room.

My server brought the menu, noted the specials of the day, then went to the à la carte selections, and finally showed me the two tasting menus on the last page.  He recommended the 4 course if I wanted a tasting menu as there were choices for each course.  I opted for no choice--the 5 course selection--because I liked the different things that were offered, choice or no choice.

They brought out some bread--normal Italian bread and Focaccia.  The waiter poured the EVOO into a small dish and then added balsamic vinegar.  Several times during the meal I was asked if I wanted more.  They were very attentive.

Descriptions are from Sirio's online menu:

Course 1:  Appetizer--Crispy langoustine tails in Kataifi crust, white balsamic syrup, and sweet pea-mint sauce.  The langoustine was excellent and the pea-mint sauce was very tasty.  The stringy top was a bit difficult to eat and I had much of it on my placemat.  You just can't take me anywhere.

Course 2:  Pasta--Asparagus ravioli, parmesan sauce, early summer truffles.  The server put extra grated cheese on my dish as desired.  The ravioli was excellent and the parmesan sauce was delicious.

Course 3: Fish Entrée--Roasted halibut fillet with spotted prawn, sautéed fava beans and morel mushrooms, and sweet onion purée.  Another winner.  My server asked me if I wanted parmesan on this, and I had some sprinkled on.  The fava beans and the morels just gave the dish an extra flavor and texture that made everything stand out.

Course 4:  Meat Entrée--Roasted Wagyu beef flat iron steak stuffed with Swiss chard and spinach, roasted new potatoes, garlic demi glacé.  Excellent!  The beef was superb and the Swiss chard added a nice flavor.

Course 5:  Dessert--Sautéed balsamic strawberries, lemon Zeppole and pistachio gelato.  There were some glazed walnut pieces and some extra chopped pistachios sprinkled on the strawberries.  This was excellent, too!

Service was top notch from the time I walked in until I left.  Someone was always stopping by to see if everything was OK or if I wanted something without being bothersome.  Fresh iced tea glasses were brought and the almost empty ones whisked away.

The one server took me to see the private dining room you can book for a group dinner.  It's a beautiful room.  Now, if I can only get Yelp to host a dinner there, we're set!

Since the temperatures are now in the 100 and stupid range, eating on the patio was not an option for me.  I went inside and was greeted warmly by Theresa and I was told to sit anywhere.  It was 5:30 and most of the people there were at the bar.

I was brought a menu and an iced tea quickly and once my eyes adjusted to the dark interior, I looked through the menu and made my decision.

The soup was great.  Good cheese flavor and nice pieces of sliced cabbage.  A good starter.  Next, the fish and chips were brought. It was not your ordinary fish and chips.  Instead of two or three small filets battered and served, it was one large filet that had been dipped in a batter that when fried, it came out almost like a pastry coating rather than a breading.  That's not a bad thing, it was just so different from anything I've been served before when I've gotten fish and chips.  The meal also came with a small dish of peas.

I liked the moist fish but there was a lot of batter.  I used all the tartar sauce with the fish.  The chips were more British than the normal French fries we're served and they were good.

For dessert, I got the chocolate bread pudding à la mode.  Because the pudding is so hot, Theresa brought the ice cream in a small bowl so it didn't melt over the bread pudding immediately.

Service was very good!  Theresa was a pleasant and efficient server.  She refilled my iced tea without asking.  I like the décor of the place and except for the USC banner, it replicates a British pub fairly well.  There are two dart boards and both were being used while I was there.  I didn't like the loudness of the music.  If I were not dining solo, it would have been difficult to carry on a decent conversation.  

I do have to go back and try the Scotch egg.  I forgot all about this.  Next time and one of the pub's pies.  I'll be back.",13,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I was seated promptly without reservation and I was soon brought water, iced tea, and chips with salsa.  I had a few minutes to study the menu once again--I really didn't have to--when the server came back to take my order.  The chips were warm and the salsa had a good flavor with lots of cilantro flavor and a small amount of bite.

The Cabo azul is a mixed seafood plate with a (1) grilled chile relleno stuffed with Dungeness crab, shrimp, and jack cheese, (2) a lobster enchilada in pasilla sauce, and (3) a shrimp taco served in a soft flour tortilla that's been slightly grilled.  The dish was wonderful!  It's a great selection of seafood.

There was no skimping on any of the fillings.  The enchilada had great tasting lobster.  The crab and shrimp in the chile relleno was plentiful, and the grilled shrimp in the taco were excellent!  The dish also had black beans and rice.  The chile wasn't hot at all.  Although I like hot peppers, I think it would have detracted from the crab and shrimp.  For dessert, I went with their fried ice cream which was standard and good.

Service was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without asking, plates were cleared quickly, and a manager came by two times to see how things were and once to chat about the heat or lack of the chile.

The room is really nicely done with different decorations including a wall of carved wood that is quite interesting (see other peoples' photos).  This is a place I'll revisit!",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I had the tropical spring rolls and a Slanted size beef pho. The spring rolls had shrimp, vegetables, wonton strips, and mango. Everything was fresh and cool, a good contrasting juxtaposition with the hot beef pho. I enjoyed all the ingredients in the spring roll overall, but there were so little wonton chips in the roll that they didn't provide much of a texture difference in the dish. The miso vinaigrette dipping sauce and additional ""grandma"" chili sauce provided by my server were flavorful and great with the roll.

The pho was perfectly portioned for lunch. You'll find it in the appetizer section of the menu. It had a good ratio of beef to noodle, and I appreciated that the cilantro was a component placed on the side rather than chopped up into the soup. It was on the same plate with the requisite basil, bean sprouts and lime wedge. Overall I liked the pho. The beef was thinly sliced and very tender. The broth was more on the light side and didn't have a lot of depth or complexity of flavor as pho from other restaurants I've been to though.

Service was friendly and sweet from Priscilla.

The menu is quite varied for an oatmeal bar, and the gentleman at the counter was friendly and patient as he explained their selections to us. I decided on the traditional style (oatmeal and hot water) gingerbread oatmeal and also shared some glogg pancakes. 

The oatmeal was excellent, with a combination of flavors and textures that were pleasing to the palate. I loved the kick of ginger in it. The pancakes were amazing. The flavor was really like glogg, with just the right amount of spices and bits of tangy fruit flavor. 

There is an equally diverse selection of drinks such as teas, coffee, smoothies, and coffee alternatives. I grabbed a honeybush cacao iced tea from the fridge. It was a very very light tasting tea, almost to the point where if I hadn't known it was iced tea I would say it tasted more like tinted iced water.

I drive by this area all the time and had never ventured into this part of the shopping plaza until I saw all the lovely photos of delicious food here on Yelp. It's a small little restaurant off to the side a few doors down from Subway next to a pawn shop. They are still so new that they don't have official signage up, but don't let that stop you from enjoying their menu!

The restaurant is beautifully appointed with serene accents of dark wood, lush purple and jewel toned green. We were greeted warmly by the chef/owner who was also multitasking today as our server and we had our pick of comfy booths and tables.

The menu features a tour of various Southeastern Asian cuisines, with Thai, Vietnamese, and Laotian dishes. We had the vegetable eggroll appetizer and shared a tom yum fried rice and pad pet. The appetizer was decent, with cabbage, glass noodles, and carrot. It was fried until golden brown and served with a sweet sauce. The chef, upon hearing I like to kick up the spice level, brought out a condiment tray with sweet chili sauce, savory chili sauce, sriracha, and soy sauce. Awesome! I loved the combination of the different chili sauces with the sweet dipping sauce the rolls came with. 

The dishes were a lovely sight to behold, with unique vegetables you typically don't see in your usual Thai restaurant such as Thai eggplant and beech(?) mushrooms. The tom yum fried rice was amazing, with tender chicken, vegetables, and the bold tom yum flavor running through the rice. I enjoyed the pad pet as well, a Laotian red curry dish, and I was excited to try a taste of Laotian cuisine. We talked with the chef, and it was clear she holds a lot of pride and passion in presenting real Asian cuisine just like you would eat if you were visiting one of the countries represented at this restaurant.

I also indulged in a rich, almost syrupy Thai coffee, a strong potent elixir that was smooth and had a perfect amount of sweetness. It was served iced in a large glass that was satisfying to drink with our meals.

Our total for the iced coffee, appetizer and 2 entrees was a little less than $30.

Stop by and try them out. They have lunch specials right now for $8, and this is probably the only place in the Phoenix area where you will find a true taste of Laotian cuisine!",41,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We ordered from the menu.  I got the chicken marsala and my friend got chicken parmigiana.  We received a nice basket of garlic bread - much more than is needed for two people.  It was good.  Part of the bread was crunchy and part was soft.  You could take your choice.

Both lunches came with choice of soup or salad.  We each got the salad which came with a creamy Italian.  It was good.  Each lunch came with rigatoni with red sauce.  The sauce was good--nothing exceptional but there was certainly nothing wrong with it.  We passed on getting any dessert.  What was served was more than enough for lunch.  My iced tea was refilled without asking and my friend's water glass was refilled.

Lunch was $10.99 each and they took the coupon from their menu page (buy one entrée and get half off a second entrée).

Beijing Express excels in your typical Americanized Chinese fast food, with old stand bys such as General Tso's chicken and chop suey. We stopped by for an eat-in experience, and browsed through the menu before deciding on kung pao chicken, eggplant in garlic sauce, and tofu with broccoli. Service was friendly, fast, and efficient as our order was prepared and served in near record time. 

I appreciated that we were served a little bag of crispy wonton strips with sweet and sour sauce, with some egg drop soup. The soup was piping hot and a generous portion. When our meals came out, they were a heaping portion on the styrofoam plate, with plenty of rice to go with it. The kung pao chicken had a nice heat to it, from the added mixture of whole dried red chilis, while the eggplant and tofu had more of a sweet brown sauce. While our food tasted fresh and flavorful, make no mistake this isn't in any way healthy, as the sauces were an unctuous mixture, glistening with oil. 

There were plenty of leftovers to take back from ordering 3 dishes for just the two of us. Each dish was under $10, most of them hovering around the $7 range. They do not have a soda fountain, and all drinks are by the bottle.

xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw,1,2012-07-21,0,pmFW9WU8RS1YcZ6Pnv7FMQ,3,"Being a lifelong YC's patron, my interest was piqued when I saw there was another Mongolian bbq restaurant in Tempe.  To short-cut to the differences between the two, Genghis Grill:

-Has smaller bowls, so smaller portions as a result
-Has more selection, with more expensive types of meat and veggies such as bay scallops, calamari, and snow peas
-Is about $10 for a single bowl
-Has thicker, sweeter tasting sauces that have to be mixed in after the food is cooked (Otherwise they burn due to the sugar content).  With YC's, the sauces can be directly ladled onto your bowl and are cooked with the meat and vegetables.
-Offers alcoholic beverages, and has a cheap happy hour (Which I have yet to try)
-Does not have any free range soup or soft serve with your meal.  Drinks are provided by your server, rather than a free range soda fountain.
-Servers bring your bowl to your table, rather than waiting at the counter
-Does not offer you any waxed paper to push your meat/vegetables into the bowl so you can maximize on bowl space

Since the price is the same no matter what you get, I loaded up on seafood, getting a mix of marinated fish, shrimp, scallops, and calamari.  I got some veggies, 2 spoons of spice mixture, and a mix of szechuan, Khanzu, and ginger-citrus sauce.  While the combination tasted good itself, the thinner cuts of seafood ended up being done faster than the larger cuts.  As a result, the scallops and calamari tasted tough and overcooked while the shrimp was cooked just right.  

Service was friendly and attentive.  While I do like the bigger selection of items to choose from, I like the thinner, less sugary sauces at YC's and the bigger bowls.  It's a tough call, but I would say, if you want more seafood and higher quality meat in general, go with Genghis, but the better deal will be at YC's.",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The first time I came here, I browsed through the vegetarian menu before the employee recommended his favorite, the Captain Kirk (An item from their San Francisco menu, but they will make any SF item for you that they don't have in the Mesa menu). It was heavenly. The bread was the right amount of chewiness and crispness, paired with the perfectly crispy breaded faux chicken, cool avocado, orange glaze, and lightly spicy pepper jack cheese. The crispy lettuce and tomato that came with it also added some texture and temperature difference to complete the loveliness of the sandwich. 

While other sandwiches I've had here have been good (The Pilgrim, Handsome Owl), the Captain Kirk is still the best one I've had. That isn't saying too much though, since there are quite a few other menu items to go through before I proclaim one sandwich my #1 pick!

The meatballs were perfectly cooked, with great texture and flavor. The sauce was sweet and tangy which I enjoyed at first, but became too sweet for my palate towards the end of my meal.

3BEudqL74U8AZIZY4g8YBA,7,2014-09-28,5,88ThvHsZ5hSnQXvom5QysQ,4,"I came to Louis Vuitton to see the permanent art exhibit of James Turrell called Akhob.  The art installation is on the 4th floor of the Louis Vuitton store.  The exhibit is open through a reservation process described in the Las Vegas City Life article and phone number mentioned in the review by Jeremy S.

On entering the store about 15 minutes early for my appointment time, I was met by an associate who gave me a tour of the store to pass the time until my appointment.  I saw two items of historical significance to the company including a steamer case made in 1911 by the company.

We then went to the second floor and I got the chance to see a gaming chest with a roulette wheel on top, cards and chips in various drawers, and a felt layout for roulette.  I believe there was also a felt layout for blackjack and craps also.  There are only two of these gaming chests in the world, this one in Las Vegas and one at their store in Macau.

Then we went to the floor where the Turrell exhibit is.  It's not an exhibit as it's an experience.  You are asked to sign a form regarding liability--a waiver if you will.  The women at the installation are very pleasant and very knowledgable.  After talking about the experience, they take you into the adjoining room where you take off your shoes and put on surgical type booties.  

There are ten steps to get to the entrance to the first of two arched chambers.  She walks you forward to the front chamber.  There's a small step between the two chambers.  I had been told that they would not speak to me unless I spoke to them.  I remained silent but I found it hard to stop wondering how it all was being done.  Suffice it to say, it's not the kind of art experience you'd be familiar with.  It all involves light and tricking the eyes into seeing the colors that Turrell wants you to see.  

During the approximate 20 minute cycle of colors you experience two periods that would remind you of a white out condition in a snowstorm or being in a fogged in area.  

At the end, I had several questions and the lead interpreter was very capable answering.  I found where the alarm was located and set it off (no Metro officers were called).  I think it would have been better if I had asked questions during the process rather than at the end, and I would have enjoyed it more if I had someone else with me to bounce questions/reactions off of.

This is worth a stop.  There are only three Turrell creations like this in the world all made for the Vuitton company.  It's a fun experience.  Make sure you ask a ton of questions and make sure you read about the Ganzfeld Effect before you go.  If not, they'll explain it to you.

*** 4.5 stars ***

This is truly a throwback to a bygone era.  Classy, old school, soft lighting, nice music quietly playing so you can have a conversation--you know--like the good old days.

Course 1:  The Original Spinning Bowl Salad--Crisp romaine and iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, shredded beets, chopped eggs and croutons, tossed with our exclusive Vintage Dressing (from the Lawry's menu.  The server wheels a cart with a stainless bowl of greens.  This bowl is in a second bowl that has ice to keep the greens chilled.  The server spins the bowl in the ice and lifts the Lawry's salad dressing high and pours it over the spinning bowl.  It's plated and served.  Very old school way of doing things but it's lots of fun.  

Course 2:  I chose the Lawry cut of prime rib--a 10 ounce slice of prime rib.  The other option was salmon but why the hell would I come to this restaurant to eat salmon?  The ribs are wheeled in a large covered cart to your table where the server asks you how you want the prime rib done and what sides you want.  I went with the standard mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  While the chef was cutting the meat and putting the sides together, my server, Mrs. Bender (sort of like Charlotte Rae from ""The Facts of Life"" TV show) went off to the kitchen to get my Yorkshire pudding, something I haven't had in years.  The chef placed the meat on my table, and she used two forks to cut the pudding into four roughly equal pieces/.  She had already brought a mild and strong horseradish, so I was ready to dig in.  The meat was tender.  No steak knife is needed here and the potatoes and creamed spinach were top notch!

Course 3:  How can you get to dessert and not choose a chocolate bag.  Too bad it wasn't the size of a Macy's shopping bag but you can't have everything!  The menu describes the bag this way:  Filled with a double rich Belgium mousse, fresh assorted berries with a raspberry Chambord sauce, topped with mint and shaved chocolate.  The bag is a rectangular shaped piece of chocolate filled with the goodies described.  It was superb!

The whole experience was pleasant from being greeted at the door and the woman who verified my reservation.  I especially liked the sign telling men to take the damn hats off before entering the dining room.  It's a shame the sign has to be there, but I liked it!  Mrs. Bender was a gem.  She was like a little house mother with her cart, her spinning bowl, her orchestrating the various aspects so the cart got to me and the meat was what I wanted before she dashed to get the Yorkshire pudding.  Service was impeccable.  

Note:  The good old days weren't as good as we think they were.  We're just getting older and the past seems a gentler time.",4,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I was brought my iced tea quickly along with a glass of water.  The tea was refilled throughout my time there.  I ordered the pork carnitas and a side of Mexican street corn.  The carnitas were served differently than most places.  Instead of getting pork that has been shredded off and plated, this pork came in a cast iron round pan and was pretty much a solid piece of pork that you just pulled on with your fork and the tender pork came away.  It was excellent and the meat stayed much juicier served this way.

The Mexican street corn was good but I should have asked for some extra cotija cheese to give it a bit more of the street corn flavor since it was off the cob and had not been brushed with mayo.  It was good nonetheless.

For dessert, I got something they serve that is quite different.  Their warm rice pudding is served with corn flakes on top, dusted with cinnamon, and topped with whipped cream.  The soft texture of the rice pudding with the crunchiness of the flakes made this a memorable dessert.

My server was James and he was great!  He told me about the rice pudding, advised me it would be about 10 minutes, and then brought it for me to enjoy.

The lining up an hour in advance drives me crazy and I just don't do it.  I don't need to sit that close in this small theatre.  I sat in the very last row next to the sound booth and my view was perfectly good.

I thought the lining up was a bit better last night.  I arrived 15 minutes before the show was to start and I ran into the new routine of having your photo taken before you enter the theatre and then getting into another line.  Since I was alone, the young woman let me skip the photo and go right to the general admission line toward the Stripper Bar.  Then it was a wait there until the other show let out and we could enter.

I like the opening comic/juggler.  He's good.  I've seen him before but I still laughed at his silly puns and jokes.   The Ukrainian gymnast was good but didn't really wow me.  I did get the chance to see Melinda--the First Lady of Magic.  It was sort of blah.  I guess I'm beyond magic.

The frybread was perfect. It was just the right amount of light crispness, not too doughy, with a slight amount of chew. The toppings in the frybread were fresh and went well together. The side of guacamole was a good portion to go with my meal. 

The meal came with a selection of salsa/hot sauce and chips. The chips were thick and crispy. I loved the 3 different bottles of hot sauce/salsa (Red, green, chipotle). They aren't afraid to pack a spicy punch! I made my frybread XMas style putting both green and red sauce on it for maximum deliciousness!

The horchata was freshly made, light and sweet. It had too much of a powdery taste for me though.

The Elvis Theatre on the second floor has some interesting art across from the entrance, and there's more near the buffet.

No review would be complete without mentioning the Holzer art in the North Valet pickup area.  It's stunning to see, especially at night.  I've been surprised that a Las Vegas casino would be so forward looking as to install this art.

The property appeals to me a lot in many ways.",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We had a Restaurant.com certificate for what is now called Alexis Gardens and used it tonight before a show.  Our server, Brenda, was excellent!   My wife is a fussy eater.  She wanted a chicken dish and the Chicken Oscar seemed what she wanted except the ""Oscar"" part.  Brenda made sure that the ""Oscar"" part, the lump crabmeat and the bernaise sauce were put in separate cups so I could have them and my wife had a plain chicken breast with extra grilled asparagus.  I ordered the ribeye steak which came with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.

The steak was cooked black and blue as I requested and my side of crabmeat was delicious.  The bernaise sauce was a bit salty so I only used a small amount.  For dessert, I hade a piece of carrot cake which was standard, but good.

I would give this restaurant four full stars except for the lack of menu selection.  The menu is quite limited.  Therefore, I deducted the 1/2 star from 4.  

Again, service was outstanding and the food was very good!",0,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

It wasn't too busy on a Friday night when we came in, which allowed us to browse through the menu leisurely. There is an extensive selection of burgers in single, double, or rocket size (3 patties on a sub roll. Wow!) and an equally impressive selection of sodas to choose from. The sodas in the cases are sorted out very nicely by flavor, and I love that they offer craft sodas at the fountain (Batch brand). 

I decided on a cheeseburger with avocado and tried some of the Reuburger. For sides we had the ""pick two"" option of fried zucchini and onion rings. The meals came out swiftly and we were on our way to satisfy our growling stomachs!

The cheeseburger was served on a buttered, toasted bun with onions, pickles, lettuce and tomato. I loved the crisp, fresh vegetables with the buttery lightly toasted bun and melted cheese. It was hard to discern a lot of burger/meat flavor with a single patty though so I will have to order this as a double for next time. Note that all patties are served well done. The Reuburger was a combination of Reuben and burger, served with sauerkraut and pastrami. I loved the mix of ground beef with pastrami in conjunction with the sauerkraut. 

The sides were crispy and piping hot from the fryer. The vegetables were tender on the inside and I loved the addition of cornmeal as an added crunch to the batter.

Service was great. Our cashier was friendly and the owner stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our meals.

Overall 4.5/5. This is a excellent place to get a burger! 

P.S. Where else are you going to find Snozzberry soda on tap to go with your tasty burger and sides?",21,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The staff was super friendly and I soon had two tacos--one al pastor and one of their Vampiro.  I also got an elote--the first time I've had this at a Mexican restaurant.  I am a fan of this street food for sure.

The tacos were good.  I got everything on the al pastor and the pineapple tends to overwhelm the rest of the taco.  I also dumped a fair amount of their hottest salsa on, so tasting for details wasn't too much of an option.  I got the Vampiro with carnitas.  The server grabbed a large piece of pork that was simmering in some nice juices and sliced away to put in the Vampiro.  This was very tasty and I'm glad I got it.  As for the elote, I really am a fan.  The cotija and then dusting with Mexican chili powder make for a great taste combination.

Last night was Mariachi Monday and there was a Mariachi band playing in the foyer and just inside the restaurant for about the first hour I was there.  It did make conversation a bit difficult but it added to the atmosphere.

The restaurant has a partial second floor which gives you more options for sitting.  However, when you forget something, like getting a drink and some plastic utensils, it's down the steps and back up again.  Better to get your hunger on a bit more.

As I said before, the staff was really great!  They'll ham it up and pose for any photo op you want and they are helpful in answering any questions.  The ladies at thew register were just the same.

I went with a white chocolate chip oatmeal top cookie, double chocolate chip bottom, orange ice cream, and gummy bear edging. 

The cookies were soft and still warm which was a great contrast with the huge scoop of ice cream I got which was creamy, slightly tart, and smooth. The gummy bear edging looked pretty with the kaleidoscope of colors tumbling down the cookie and ice cream and were chewy and fresh. Of the two cookies I liked the combination of the white chocolate oatmeal cookie with the orange ice cream the best.

The price for a cookie is a little less than $5 and it was definitely enough to split between two people. Note that you probably can't eat it sandwich style since it's so big but the cookies are so soft you can easily cut into them with a spoon. 

In addition to ice cream sandwiches they also have bottled sodas, and offer shakes. While this was a tasty ice cream sandwich I do prefer the macaron ice cream sandwich from Fatty Daddy's as my top dessert sandwich but that's just my preference.

Every item is carefully picked to make sure it not only meets the highest quality standards, but is as environmentally and ethically responsible as possible. I had been to the Chandler location and liked their selection so I decided to stop by the Gilbert location on the way back home. 

Prices I saw compared to Sprouts were comparable, if not better, for items that I was looking for, including raw almonds and coconut oil. I was actually in the search for some wild boar meat. Looking on the Durham website Natural Grocers was one of the stores that carried it (Sprouts is another store that offers it). I hadn't seen it at Sprouts on my latest trip there so I was hoping to find it here. Unfortunately they didn't have it but they did have a small selection of other game meat by the same company (Venison, Elk, Bison). Prices for the venison and elk were considerably cheaper compared to Sprouts and it was 100% pure game meat as opposed to the 97%/3% beef at Sprouts.

Service was great at check out. I love going to businesses where the employees are happy and genuinely love to be there. Be sure to bring your own bag if you don't want your goods packaged in a cut down cardboard box a la Costco style.

Natural Grocers also has an intriguing rewards program that offers store credit when you reach a certain dollar amount, and store credits when you go to 5 of their free information sessions. I browsed through the list and they were all very health-oriented, eco-friendly type subjects.

I ordered a pound of shrimp, medium spice, with the sauce being the Hot N Juicy which is a combination of all their sauces.  you put on your bib and some plastic gloves and when your bag of goodness arrives, you dig in and start taking off the shells.

After awhile, I got really frustrated with the slowness at which I was removing shells.  I took off the gloves and then the process became easier--messier fingers but faster work.

Robin was our main server and she was a GEM!  What a pleasant woman and what a help!

FNe5PPA9pyj8FjcDefCBpg,3,2012-02-19,1,Qell-b8jVjjnibMNRbyKpQ,4,"I am a fan of this small but nicely decorated Thai restaurant.  I was there for the first time--certainly not the last time--Saturday night.  I had the Yelp deal and it worked beautifully.

I started with the crab stick appetizer.  Here's how the menu describes it:  Deep fried rice paper wrapped with mix crab meat & cream sauce, served with homemade plum sauce.  When I saw 6 sticks, I thought there was no way I could eat all of them and have room for dinner.  Wrong!  They were so very tasty you could never leave one to be taken away.  The plum sauce was good, and my server brought me the hot spice holder and I used some chili paste to spice up some of the sticks.

For the main course, I ordered from the Issan (northern Thailand area) part of the menu which offers foods with more spice kick.  I got the Ped Nom Tok, and the menu describes it like this:  Sliced boneless roasted duck home made with chili paste, herbs, spices & lime juice.  I asked for a spicy level of 4 out of 5.  It was spicy, but from my little array of spices, I added some extra red pepper flakes.  The dish was superb!  The mint that garnished the dish and the raw cabbage gave you something to cool your palate when the red pepper heat got to be a bit much.

Time for dessert.  I had two things in mind.  Durian sticky rice or coconut ice cream.  I had been warned that the durian would cause horrendous breath.  Anthony Bourdain describes durian this way.  ""...Your breath will smell as if you'd been French-kissing your dead grandmother.""  Since I was going to a show after dinner, I opted for the coconut ice cream.  It was the safer choice, and it was very good with some small chunks of coconut mixed in.

I started dinner with a Thai iced coffee and I had an order of sticky rice.

The service was fantastic.  There were three ladies who were very attentive and answered a couple of questions I had.  I thought the one was going to say ""chicken"" when I opted out of the durian sticky rice dessert.  

The Yelp deal worked fine.  I paid $10 and received credit for $20 from Weera.  She took the code off my iPhone and asked me to mark the deal used which I did.

From large refrigeration units, prep tables, to smaller items such as plastic cups and measuring spoons, you can spend a good chunk of time browsing through all the aisles.

We picked up some metal shelving units (For an outdoor bbq table project), 2 spray nozzles, and a few bottles of sugar free flavored syrups. The selection of syrups is quite large, for both regular and sugar free. They sell DaVinci brand, and such flavors included peppermint, chai tea, and pineapple.

Check out was odd in that apparently only one lane can use the computer system at a time to pay. As a result, while the check out clerk scanned everything quickly, there was a bit of a wait while she had to wait for the other clerk in the other lane to finish her transaction.

I had checked the menu online and was going to go with the pre-theatre prix fixe menu because I was going to see 'O' again at 7:30 and this would be perfect time wise.

I was seated right after Circo opened.  The gentleman who showed me to the table brought me an iced tea and then I sat.  Shortly after, a runner brought me a nice bread basket, and then I sat.  After 15 minutes, as I watched people at other tables who came in after me looking over their menus, I turned to the woman who brought the bread and asked if there was a server for my table.  One of the servers heard me and the apologies started for thinking I already ordered because I had bread on my table.

The bread service is quite large with three varieites served with olive oil.

My server did come and brought a menu with him.  He noted some of the outstanding things on the menu.  I then asked if he had the pre-theatre menu.  Note, there was a large sign at the entrance to Circo with the menu and choices on it.  He brought me the menu and after a few minutes he came back and took my order.  He was also made aware that I had a show to get to.

I ordered the fritto misto for a starter.  This is mostly calamari with a few green beans and zucchini added.  It's served with a cherry tomato sauce.  This was very good.  The sauce, not a traditional marinara, was very good.  I was surprised by the large portion for a pre-theatre menu.

For the main course, I got Mamma Egi's ravioli, ravioli filled with sheep's milk ricotta cheese, spinach, and swiss chard in a sage butter sauce.  The ravioli were topped with grated cheese and the server asked if I wanted more cheese and/or freshly ground pepper.  I did take some ground pepper.  The ravioli were very, very good--the filling so smooth and tasty.  Again, I was surprised by the large portion size. 

For dessert, I opted for the vanilla crème brûlée on the menu which wasn't the same choice as the online menu.  I had wanted to try the Nutella panna cotta but it was not to be.  With dessert, I was brought a dish with two chocolate biscotti and two mignardises, the best being a small meringue cookie.  The crème brûlée was good but nothing different than I've had before.

Service was off.  The check listed a team number rather than a server and the team just wasn't on that night.  Sitting for 15 minutes without a menu until I asked?  Aren't menus given to you when you're seated.  Evidently, Circo does this a different way.  

When a restaurant advertises its pre-theatre on a large sign and on the website, it should be given to you when you get the regular menu.  Ordering from the pre-theatre menu doesn't make me less of a customer than those who order off the regular menu.  Before leaving, the main server asked me if I wanted more cookies and I politely declined.  As I was putting away my credit card and getting my charge slips together, another server came with a plate of those cookies.  I politely declined again.  

Finally, I really dislike when a website has a menu and then it's different than the ""real"" one.  Crème brûlée is good, but I really wanted to experience that Nutella panna cotta.  If you're going to do an online menu, keep it up-to-date.

This would normally be a 4 star review if I was rating simply the food.  The service was off such that I can't give it the four stars.  There have been reports that Circo would be closing this spring.  If the reports are true, is the service a sign of lack of care in some respect?",10,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,12,2015-08-17,9,CNb_tIGdEbnElZtTtwJ7CA,5,"Two of us came here for a breakfast tasting with a menu set by Chef Chris Decker.  When we arrived, he asked if we wanted to order or just let him send out what he had planned.  We opted for him just to send things out.

We started with a triple berry yogurt parfait with house-made granola.  We then moved on to five sweets--One of Those, Toaster Strudel, Plum and sweet ricotta turnover,  Peach turnover, and Apple pie croissant.  

After the sweets, Chef Decker brought two egg sandwiches--Bat Ship Crazy and Farm House, two French toast selections--blueberry and peach, and apple raisin.  and an order of Benecio del Porko, an eggs Benedict on house made corn bread topped with BBQ pulled pork.  We also had a breakfast burrito.

This isn't your typical eggs and bacon with hash browns kind of restaurant.  Rather, breakfast here can be coffee and a couple of these wonderful pastries for a sweet breakfast or you can go to the savory side and get one of the egg sandwiches or other breakfast items.

Not one of the pastries failed to satisfy!  The One of Those is Chef Decker's take on the cronut.  It's named that because you weren't allowed to use the word cronut so customers would just say One of Those.  Between the layers of flaky pastry are layers of wonderfully tasting cream that makes this a sweet treat for sure!   The plum and sweet ricotta turnover and the apple pie  croissant were two more outstanding sweets.

On to the savories, the Benecio del Porko, grilled cornbread topped with BBQ pulled pork, two eggs over easy, Hollandaise, charred corn kernels, and cilantro is sublime!  There's a reason this has been selected best Benedict almost since opening.  Everything in this Benedict just melds perfectly.   The other standouts were the French toasts.  They taste more like you're eating bread pudding than French toast.  The soft brioche with the fruit and a dollop of whipped cream are heavenly.  The two egg sandwiches were excellent also.  Again, I found all items to have outstanding taste.

During our tasting, Chef Decker took the time to explain his passion for breads and he gave us a huge amount of information on the dishes.  

Finding out that Chef Decker came from Upstate New York, a graduate of Maine-Endwell  Central School District did not cause me to downgrade my rating.  Our two schools were in different conferences then!

After a fun outing at C2, we were excited to see Roosters parked outside since we were hungry for lunch! We were greeted warmly, and browsed through the small menu. Today's selections included fried chicken, pulled pork sliders, and corn dogs. Each came with one side, as chips or fries. Drink selections included Coke (Regular and diet), Monster energy drink, and Gatorade. We opted for the fried chicken, pulled pork sliders, with fries. 

While we were waiting, we were given a sample of some lovely tater tots, a nice hot appetizer to stave off hunger and the slight chill of the late morning. Our entrees were made very quickly, which we appreciated a lot!

The fried chicken had a nicely crispy outer crust, well-seasoned, with tender, juicy chicken. The 2 piece meal I got came with a leg and a thigh. The breading here was more tender rather than super crunchy, and went well with the flavor of the chicken. The pulled pork in the sandwich was mild tasting, with a light, slightly sweet bbq sauce mixed in with it. For the most part the pork was tender, although a few chunks I had were a little tough. The roll my fried chicken came with was lightly sweet, like a King's Hawaiian roll, and the fries were hot, crispy, and crinkle cut.

I had a free ticket for the show last night and I made a dinner reservation, too.  The website said they were fully booked, but when I called the Cosmopolitan, she made a reservation for me.

I got my ticket at the box office on the second floor and went to the Rose.Rabbit.Lie entrance at 6 PM for my reservation.  There was a couple in line ahead of me.  They weren't yet open.  There's a lot of security and ear pieces in this area across from the Wicked Spoon buffet.  When they opened, the woman asked me if I wanted a table or to sit at a bar.  Since I was alone, I told her the bar.  She asked which one I wanted to go to and I couldn't answer.  I let her choose and she took me to the Library Bar.

There are several rooms behind closed doors after you enter the main door.  On the left was the Library, a small room with about 8 tables and 8 or so seats at the bar.  I took the end seat and I was so glad this was where I was.  We could hear the music from next door--it turned out to be the Music Room--and the bartender who waited on me was Anthony!  He was perfect--knowledgable about the menu and he made some great recommendations to me.  

Most of the dishes are tapas style.  I ordered the Brussels sprouts with crispy chicken skin. Manchego cheese and Spanish paprika.  I also ordered Tête de Cochon--pig head with a slow cooked egg.  The pig head was cooked and the meat was seasoned and formed into a small rectangle.  It was lightly battered with panko breadcrumbs and lightly fried.  Served with a soft poached egg, it was delightful.  Breaking the egg and letting it run over the pork was so very good!  The Brussels sprouts were wonderful!  I could not have had two better recommendations!

I chose desert on my own.  I ordered the butterscotch pudding with a chocolate and hazelnut ""stone"".  The dessert was a perfect ending to the meal.  The butterscotch was salted and the ""stone"" was very tasty!

Service was excellent and sitting at the bar was a show in itself.  Anthony showed me and the gentleman seated next to me the 3 kinds of special ice cubes they make for Rose.Rabbit.Lie.  Quite interesting and creative.

From here, I was shown to the Music Room where I listened to a 5 piece combo play.  There was a singer who walked on the bar in the Music Room.  One of the entertainer/ushers--a friend of mine--came in to work.  I had no idea he had gotten a job here.  He told me that we'd be shown into the Ballroom (another place to eat and drink) and then we'd go to the showroom.  The combo and the singers went into the Ballroom and then the doors were opened to the Showroom.  

The show is called Vegas Nocturne and although the website lists it as 70 minutes, it's more like 95 minutes in length.  There are two types of chairs and I got seated in a row that had the hard folding chairs.

The show is a milder version of its cousin, Absinthe.  The acts are lower key in a way because of the low ceiling.  The acts are very good, the comedy is quite funny, and it was a perfect end for my evening.  Katy Perry was in the audience.

This was a wonderful evening and I'm so glad I went.  I'm not sure I'd pay the full price for the show.  It's a bit steep considering the other entertainment available on the Strip but as part of an entire evening at Rose.Rabbit.Lie, it was just perfect!",29,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

In my quest to try different spots for breakfast, I've started hitting local golf clubs that are open to the public.  Bear's Best is only about 2 miles from where I live, so this was a no brainer for breakfast before going to the Great Las Vegas Santa Run 2011.

I'd give this restaurant 3 stars, but a few things tipped the balance to 4.  The menu is small--5 items.  I ordered the breakfast burrito, a nice sized burrito with scrambled eggs, ham, peppers, and home fries.  It was served with fire roasted salsa that was tasty but mild.  They did have tabasco on the table, but that's not for me for a burrito.

The food was very hot, the service was very, very prompt, and the server was just a delight.  She had a pleasant attitude. I chuckled with her when the guy before me walked away with his coffee with shot of Bailey's Irish Cream and brandy.  The wind and cold wasn't going to bother this guy!

I'll come back for lunch sometime when it's warm and I can enjoy the food and the view of Blue Diamond Hill from the patio.  Damn, I just wish they'd let me ride the cart path on my bike.  It's not too big of a thing to ask!  :-)",1,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Since it was 1/2 price Senior Thursday, the line was huge.  Luckily, the friends I was meeting at the Palms had the good sense to get in line without waiting for me, so our wait was long, but not as bad as it could have been.  And for $6.49 for lunch, how can you beat the price?

I had some Thai red curry chicken, a piece of thin steak they called NY sirloin, some Hawaiian style pork, shrimp pad Thai, among other things.  The curry chicken was about the best thing I had.  It had a good curry zip but not enough to intimidate those who don't like spicy food.  I would have liked to have had spicier, but then it wouldn't appeal to the masses.

Since we were at the end of the lunch time frame, desserts were flying of the shelves en masse.  What was left was good.  Mostly mini cupcakes and mini cake squares.

The seating is limited for the numbers of people they draw and this makes it less likely that I'll be here often.  There are other buffets in town with better food and seating arrangements.  The price is the most positive thing about the Bistro Buffet.",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Topgolf combines the ease of play that putt-putt golf provides with a game-like atmosphere similar to bowling in a driving range setting. There are 3 levels which can fill up fast on the weekends, so getting there early is recommended.

We came here for a friend's birthday party and enjoyed the beautiful weather. There are different games that you can play, all centering around hitting your golf ball in a certain colored zone. This means that even though you might be a seasoned golfer, you won't necessarily gain points if you don't hit the ball in the exact area where the zones are. You can bring your own clubs, or they have ones at the range that you can use, separated by number/type and by what distance they can hit.

Prices here are by the hour, and are tiered by time (Morning, afternoon, evening). The morning times are the cheapest by the hour, with prices increasing as you approach evening. We got here around 9 A.M. when they open, and there was already a line out the door. 

In addition to the driving range, there are overhead TVs so you can watch professional golf while playing golf, an indoor lounge area, and tables where you can snack, imbibe, or have a full meal. The menu itself consists of bar/party type food such as fries, sandwiches, and some wonderfully delightful donut holes that you fill with your choice of 3 different flavors.

Service here was excellent, provided by our server Ashley. 

Overall it's a fun place if you're looking for a group activity that provides casual sport, food, and entertainment. Just be sure you know how to swing that golf club without injuring yourself, since I twisted my wrist while swinging and it's still a little sore a few days later!",4,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We first went to a restaurant that had a 35 minute wait.  We opted not to wait and started Yelping on our smart phones to find somewhere else.  On the way to a 2nd suggested place, Warren P. found Jamms and since it was nearby, I piloted the car to Jamms.  What a nice stop for idea #3.

The three of us started out with a free pot of bread, just for mentioning Yelp.  They have plain, cinnamon, and the flavor of the day was green chili and cheese which is what I got.  It comes with a cup of softened butter and was tasty.

I had the S'mores pancake.  That's pancake batter with marshmallow and chocolate chips in the batter.  It's topped with some extra chocolate chips--for good measure-- that soften from the hot pancake.  There is also a drizzle of caramel sauce on the pancake.  I got the single pancale and it was a perfect ending to a great hike.

We ordered:

Factory hummus order and pita (free with Yelp check in)
Falafel appetizer with fresh vegetables and tahini sauce
Meat combination with one beef kabob, one kafta, one sujuk and one kibbi with baba ghanoush (susbstiution of zucchini fries for rice for an upcharge)
Gyro sandwich (substitute eggplant fries instead of rice for an upcharge)
Baklava
Rice pudding
Shabiet

I ordered an iced tea also and was brought refills several times without needing to ask.  I also asked if I could sample their ghost pepper sauce that you can get with hummus.  Our server, Nikki, brought a small cup of the sauce and warned me to only dip the pita in a little bit of the sauce.  That's what I did and immediately started hiccuping from the reaction to the heat of the ghost pepper.  I won't be eating that--it is very hot as I guessed it would be.

First off before trying the ghost pepper sauce, we were brought an order of hummus and very hot, house made pita bread.  Both were excellent.  The pita was so light and fluffy in texture.  It was with a small piece of the pita that I tries the ghost pepper sauce.  We also had a small round of butter that was flavorful with the pita.

Next up came the falafel appetizer.  Good falafels with good tasting tahini and a selection of fresh vegetables to go with the falafel.  Next came our two main courses.  One was a gyro sandwich with zucchini fries and one was the meat combination with eggplant fries and an order of baba ghanoush.  Of the fries, the eggplant were better to my taste although the zucchini were good, too.  Good gyro.  The meat combination was very good.  Standout on this dish was the sujuk--spicy sausage.  The spice was perfect for this meat.

We ended our meal with 3 desserts, baklava, rice pudding, and shabiet.  The baklava is much different than I've had before.  There is honey but it's not dripping or swimming in honey.  In addition, it's small in width and shaped like a piece of Kit Kat.  Very tasty and a different way of making it.  The rice pudding was quite creamy and very good and last, the shabiet with its ashta cream was very good.  The shabiet is shaped like a turnover and has this wonderful cream inside.

Part of my five stars also is for the service.  Our factory worker, Nikki, was really a pleasant woman who was quite interesting to speak with and she was always there to refill iced tea or my companion's water glass.

It's quite a story that this brick and mortar restaurant came about after its start as a food truck restaurant.",15,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The cows here seemed pretty well taken care of, and were fed a mixture of hay and corn, as opposed to the brown grain/feed you usually see cows eat on TV.  The petting zoo had lots of adorable animals, such as an inquisitive spotted goat, 2 calves, a long haired fuzzy bunny, various chickens, laid back sheep, and a slightly grumpy donkey (I don't know its real name, but I dubbed it Eeyore).  The store here has various dairy products such as ice cream, flavored and unflavored butters, buttermilk, flavored cheese, as well as eggs, and desserts such as chocolate dipped macaroons.  They have a very cute, albeit dusty, selection of kid's toys and various T shirts with a farm theme.  They have a farmer's market here on Thursdays, which is a good option for those looking for local produce that live in Mesa.

The atmosphere though... well... that's another story. I've been to several Steak 'n Shakes in the Midwest, and this one is more like a ""Steak 'n Shake Express."" I guess that's what makes this ""Steak 'n Shake Signature"" restaurant different, but in ways that make me miss the original versions of the chain. This isn't a diner- it's more like eating at an In N Out or a Fatburger. There's just a small seating area, you order and pick up at the counter, and it is not open 24/7. The menu is very limited as well, with less to offer than the diner versions.

The general feel of the place is more modern, and more hip. Top 40 music plays on the speakers, the interior and even the font signage out front has a contemporary feel. They even have one of the new Coke soda fountains that allow you to pick various flavor combinations. Back when I used to live in the Midwest, I had many memories of having late night eats at various Steak 'n Shakes with friends, indulging in greasy burgers and fries on white plates, and lusciously thick shakes in glass milkshake cups. Eating at this Steak 'n Shake makes me long for the actual diner, although the food itself still tastes the same. For me, some of that magic is lost for this particular restaurant when I am eating in a small area with a large crowd of people, getting my order at the counter, and eating my burger, fries, and shake in a fast-food type manner.

We went here on a Sunday around noon. We got in before the big rush, since a few minutes after we ordered, there was a line out the door, winding around the block! Our order took maybe 10-15 minutes to be made, and seating was limited. 

I ordered the Royale, partially because it conjured images of Samuel L. Jackson talking about a Royale with Cheese in Pulp Fiction, and partially because the addition of bacon and egg to a burger sounded delicious. The order came with fries, and I also had some of a banana milkshake. The Royale was indeed delicious, with juicy, flavorful ground beef, fresh tomato, crisp lettuce (Green leaf, not the cheapo iceberg lettuce!), melted cheese, a smoky salty flavor from the bacon, and a nice rich, creamy texture and taste from the fried egg. The bun was soft and held up well with the other ingredients. The shake was OK. It tasted more like imitation banana flavored syrup rather than fresh banana mixed in with ice cream, but at $3, hey what do I expect?

The fries were thin, and slightly crispy. They were decent, but the real star of the meal was the burger. 

I will be waiting the day that perhaps a full service Steak 'n Shake can open in the Phoenix area. Until then, this express version will have to do!",6,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Masseuse: ""OK"" (Then proceeds to massage everything except the neck, shoulders, and upper back until like the last 5-10 minutes)

Masseuse:  (Heavy congested breathing and stifling a few coughs.  Also, she has slightly longer nails than she probably should for her profession, because they are kind of digging into my back)

I'm not completely a fan of the show, so I'll give it 3 stars for Cirque's pushing the envelope with its technology.

I think you will appreciate the show more if you know Jackson's music--I don't for the most part except the biggest hits and mine might not be the same as anyone else's.  

When you enter the theatre, there are two threads that come into play--one, the constant write ups about Jackson in tabloids and the ceaseless hounding by paparazzi for him more than many entertainers.  The funny faux headlines in these tabloids are fun to read.  My favorite: ""Man invents his own language - Can only speak to himself.""  That shows the idiocy to which some of the tabloids went in creating incredulous stories about Jackson to sell papers.  The other part is the paparazzi, a group of five or six guys going around the theatre taking photos of audience members with one carrying a boom mike.  Another part of Jackson's, or any well known entertainer's life in the media world.  The projection on the scrim was a nice touch also.

The show started and there were a few of Jackson's songs with a bit of Cirque circus stuff.  When the songs ended, the Jackson fans in the audience cheered loudly.  Many of the people around me just sat there and didn't applaud.  It was a strange feeling that I can't quite describe.  Something along the lines of, ""Oh, OK, that song's over.

During the show there is a small amount of circus acts--the trampoline guys and the people climbing and doing tricks on fixed poles rather than the silks that Cirque is so known for.  My feeling was that they should have just left this out.  It really doesn't fit the songs and there's really no purpose except to remind you that you're at a Cirque show.  I wish they had focused completely on the technology and maybe even done more with that.  There is a lot of good music and dancing.  I recognized many of the songs but I wasn't there as a fan of Jackson but a fan of Cirque du Soleil and live entertainment.

The hologram sequence near the end was marvelous.  I think more could have been done with this throughout the show.  Not each number, but more of it.  Push the technology as far as you can and leave the trampolines out.

Finally, I learned for sure that the man in the moon is a lady.  Now you'll have to go to see the show to know what I mean.  Theatre goers who know Broadway and see this show will get my double reference in that sentence.  

This is a solid show but needs some tightening.  And, please, have some of the song ""Will You Be There"" sung instead of spoken!",6,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I then ordered their Italian omelette.  It's an omelette with Italian sausage and mozzarella cheese topped with red sauce.  It's served with potatoes that have red, yellow, and green pepper pieces.  You also get two slices of toasted Italian bread.

The veggie combo came out first but there was a significant wait for the chicken to come out next. The veggie combo comes with two types of rice (Vegetable biryani and vegetable fried rice), naan, 2 vegetable entrees, 1 appetizer, and a sweet treat. The rice was superb. It was soft, fluffy, and well seasoned. The vegetables I had in the combo were a baby eggplant curry, paneer tikka masala, and a paneer curry with onion and black mustard seeds. Out of the three savory selections my favorite was the paneer curry with onion, although I think some of the black mustard seeds were slightly burnt from cooking because they had a bitterness to them. The curry in the eggplant was not very flavorful and watery, and the paneer masala only had a few pieces of paneer in it. 

My favorite part of the meal aside from the rice was the sweet treat off to the side, a beet halwa. I loved the blend of spices, beet and butter. 

For $13 I don't think it was worth it to order this combo. It sounded like a lot of food but the entree items didn't have a lot of substance to them and the meal was loaded up on the cheap carbohydrate items as filler. I personally think that naan and 2 types of rice is too much carb to go with the rest of the food. They could probably do away with one of the rice dishes and charge less and it would be more of a balanced lunch.

As for the chicken Madras, it was served in a rich curry, with bone-like chicken. It automatically came with a side of white rice. 

Service was very polite and they were quick in refilling drinks and presenting our check.

If I go here again I would order a rice dish since that is what they seem to excel in and skip the lunch combos.",26,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

It was a litle busy when we were here around 5 P.M., with a minor wait to get seated (5-10 minutes).  

I ordered the burnt ends plate, with coleslaw and mac & cheese for sides.  The meat was delicious.  It was a good mix of tender and crisp, and the cajun bbq sauce I had it with meshed well with the flavor of the meat.  The mac and cheese was nice and creamy, with pieces of corn kernels for added texture, and browned breadcrumbs on top.  I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw.  I could only taste raw cabbage and not much else in terms of flavor, but my husband really liked it because he said it had a light flavor that he found refreshing (Hey, to each their own!).  

We were seated close to the shark tank, and it was cool seeing the sharks and fish swim around while we waited for our meals.

So, if you are at the zoo and are looking for a decent sit-down restaurant, this is a good option, especially since there doesn't seem to be a lot of places to eat at around this area.

I walked in and looked at all the furniture. Every single piece had the same drab, linen-pale-beige, burlap-sack colored fabric on it. From the looks of it (And since no salesperson deigned to talk to me to let me know otherwise), it seemed like the furniture upholstery only came in this color, and in this linen-like, sack-like fabric. I know now after looking at the website that there are actually a multitude of fabrics and colors to choose from. Why would they put the same exact, pedestrian shade and fabric on all their furniture, on all 3 floors? Variety is good! It lets customers know that your furniture is customizable!

There's also a new, small bar on the casino floor where you come down the two or three steps from the entrance to the casino.

I think I've been too spoiled by the Japanese festivals in San Francisco, since the food selection here was more limited and there wasn't as many booths to buy things from.  I did like the cultural shows, such as the taiko and the martial arts demonstrations, and the shaded area with the bonsai and akitas was nice.

I am not a fan of the price of the chocolate.  I think it's way overpriced.  

Tip #1:  If you go to see the lights and you don't have children, go about 9 PM.  The gardens are open until 10.  At that time, most if not all the little ones have gone home, and you almost have the gardens to yourself.  It's heaven.

As it turns out, Star Ginger serves up a decent bowl of pho, for $7. You have your choice of beef or chicken, and it is made to order as soon as you pay for your meal at the cashier.

The pho was a sizable portion in a large bowl. I chose chicken, and there were a lot of white meat chicken chunks in the bowl, as well as freshly shredded onion, pho noodles, and cilantro. The broth was rich and a little unctuous, and there was a plate of fresh basil, bean sprouts, and lime wedge on the side. They also included a disposable soup spoon and a small container of sriracha and hoisin sauce.

We came here for lunch right when it opened and seeing that the interior looked a bit too dark for a lively lunch, decided to sit on the scenic patio overlooking the fountain. We had the pig wings, queso dip, and I had the shrimp tamale as my main entree.

We were first served glasses of water that had strange bits of particulate in it. I'm hoping it was bits of carbon maybe from whatever filtered water was used and not something more insidious. The queso dip was a gigantic size, and served with corn tortilla chips. While I enjoyed the hearty portion I could mainly taste bean and not much chorizo as was advertised in the menu. The pig wings were delicious, covered in a slightly spicy, sticky sweet sauce with tender meat that fell off the bone. I would definitely get the pig wings again.

I wasn't very impressed with the shrimp tamale. It was a beautiful presentation but I didn't like the moat of sauce covering everything. The shrimp were plentiful and had a good grilled flavor but were slightly overcooked. I didn't really like the corn tamale either, which had a texture that was too grainy for me, and too sweet. 

Service was OK. The server didn't really seem that enthused to be here but she did provide an adequate amount of service.

The menu for lunch is all $12.50 no matter what you get, with selections such as pork tenderloin, chicken breast, shrimp, and brie with fennel.  The last two selections are what my friend and I had.  The shrimp was excellent.  It was perfectly cooked, on crispy toasted bread covered with pesto.  There were also pieces of sweet pineapple, sliced cherry tomatoes, and chopped onion to add some more color and tropical flavor.  There was a massive amount of shrimp on the plate, which made this dish a tasty and very good deal.  My friend had the brie with fennel and puff pastry (My description of this, by the way, does not do the dish justice).  All the ingredients were well prepared and very good on their own, but for me, it wasn't as good as my shrimp dish.

We started with an order of Tiger Cry and Nachos O'Brien.  I wanted to order the Hodgepodge but they don't serve that anymore.  Instead, the server suggested I get two of the dishes that made up the tower thing so I got pommes frites and Truffle tots.

The Tiger Cry and the Nachos O'Brien were both very good.  We shared the dishes and we both liked the nachos and the Tiger Cry.  The hit of the two was the TIger Cry which is Thai beef jerky with nam prik and some sesame.  There was also a container of sticky rice in a ball in a plastic bag.  I'm sot sure it was sticky rice or rice just twisted together in the plastic to make it stick together.  I expected it might be a bit spicy from the nam prik, but it was not.  However, the nam prik they did use along with the jerky glaze made this a great dish.  The nachos were good, but nothing exceptional.  

My error was in ordering both pommes frites and truffle tots.  That's a large portion of both in their small pails.  They were both very good, but I ended up eating most of the frites and finishing off the truffle tots.  I didn't taste any truffle but the cheese, parsley, and salt  made the tots very good and I loved the pommes frites.

We still had some room and I ordered the Baked and Blazed--their take on a mac and cheese dish but made with fusilli and cheddar cheese and having a nice crusty top.  This was an excellent dish, too.  When we ordered this we mentioned the Cookiemon and he said it takes 15 minutes so we had him put the order in then also.  It came out a little early because we hadn't finished the baked and blazed yet but it was OK.  Only a little ice cream melted and the very hot cookie had time to cool a bit before digging in.

Service was great.  Considering we were the only customers in the place, it should have been great.  But, it was above and beyond that.  Our server answered our questions and suggested things.  He was prompt with iced tea refills and a pleasant fellow.

From the parking lot, hike into the wash, cross the wash, and then walk up the stone steps.  Follow the trail along Ice Box Canyon until you reach a down section into the wash below.  This part of the hike is just about a mile in length.

After dropping down into the wash,  turn right and follow the wash as it winds through the canyon.  This will entail some rock and boulder scrambling.  If any of the boulders are too big to climb up, the trail will have a walk around to the left or right of the wash.  Sometimes you have to back track and go the other way, but this is the fun of hiking in a bouldering area.

From the entry into the wash, it's about 1/4 mile of rock scrambling to the end of the trail.  You'll know you're almost there when you see a tall, dead ponderosa pine leaning to the left.  The waterfall - usually dry as it was today - is just past this dead ponderosa.

When you get to the base of the waterfall, this is a good place to have a snack and chat for awhile before hiking back to your car.

Directions to trailhead:  Go west on Charleston Boulevard until you get to the Red Rock Canyon entrance.  From the fee booth (entrance fee $7), take the Scenic Drive just past mile marker 8.  The Ice Box Canyon Trailhead is on your right and is well marked.

The noodles were a bit strange to me; I'm not sure if they're supposed to taste like there's starchy powder coming off them onto your tongue when you are eating?  I've never really had that happen before when eating Vietnamese noodle soups (Maybe they used tapioca noodles instead of the rice noodles that are usually in bun bo hue?).  The soup was in a very generously sized bowl, and I was full after having about half of it.  The soup comes with your requisite sides:  basil, limes, sprouts, jalapeno.  

One thing to take note of is that they can't open the second door of the double doors that you enter the restaurant to, so those that are in wheelchairs will have some difficulty getting inside.  I saw this happen when we ate here, and while the person did manage to get inside, he had to actually get out of the wheelchair, aided by one of his friends, to enter the door, while his other friend folded up the wheelchair to bring it inside.

I ordered a cup of potato leek soup, the bone in Kona crusted sirloin and the parmesan truffle fries for a side.  Everything was very, very good.  The potato leek soup was creamy and served with a few very thin, slightly deep fried fingerling potato slices.  The soup was rich and very enjoyable.

I was fine with that, but since you have to soak in the hot tubs for around 15 minutes before your appointment starts, most of my time after putting everything in my locker was spent in the hot tub before my appointment. Why does this matter? Well, they give you a nice shampoo and conditioner in your hair during your spa treatment, so I didn't want to try the steam rooms after my appointment since my hair would need to be washed again from getting steamed and sweated over. I still was able to enjoy the facilities, but thinking about it now, I would have liked extra time to relax more before the appointment.

For those that are new to Korean spas, in most of them, you will be enjoying the facilities in your birthday suit in the gender-specific areas. There are co-ed areas, usually different saunas, that you will be wearing the pajama-like clothes they give you at check-in. At Imperial Spa, they've modified it a bit so that you can wear a bathing suit to the gender-specific areas except the hot tubs. When I went on a Friday late afternoon, it wasn't too crowded, and everyone in the women's area was either in their pajama outfit to go to the co-ed room, or naked.

On to the spa treatment. For those that like more ""relaxation"" time massages and scrubs, this isn't it! The scrub was very scratchy feeling, and a little painful. It felt kind of like someone was scrubbing me with a brillo pad. Almost every surface of your body will be scrubbed, rinsed, then scrubbed again. The hair treatment came afterward, which left my hair nice and soft. After rinsing in the showers, I was escorted to the massage rooms, where the deep tissue massage/reflexology combo treatment started. With kidney-crushing pressure, my muscles were rolled and kneaded into submission. 

I spent a few hours afterwards using the various saunas, alternating between the hot sauna and the cold room. This area is co-ed, so suit up in your ugly pink pajama pants and top! I brought both my towels with me so it wouldn't be too hot laying on some of the hot surfaces, such as the clay balls in the clay ball room.

I also tried some food in the kitchen. I was disappointed they ran out of seafood pancake (Haemul Pajeon), so I decided on the kimchi fried rice. It was made fairly quickly, and was a huge portion, but it was very hot (Almost sauna-like) in the eating area, which made it unappealing to eat hot, spicy, fried rice. I asked if I could bring the food to the air-conditioned bar area, but in an apologetic tone, The cook/owner(?) explained that people complain about the smell of the food so it isn't allowed outside the dining area. She did turn the fan on, but when there's no cool air in the room whatsoever, a fan just blows hot air around. Deciding against sweating while eating, I ate a little bit, then boxed it up to take back. The kimchi fried rice itself was OK, but the price was a bit high for me (~$13-14). Maybe if I go back I'll try a cool food or a smoothie.

Check out was easy. Any extra charges are put on your locker number. As for tip, the massage/scrub therapist will give you an envelope, and you can put cash in it, or you can charge the tip to your account up front. I found my therapist afterwards and handed a cash tip to her directly.

I'm not sure if I'll go for a scrub or massage again, but I'd definitely like to get a day pass here to relax in the steam rooms, hot tubs, and saunas. My skin does feel smoother and softer after the scrub, but I'm not sure it was worth enduring being scrubbed until it feels like your skin is raw (It wasn't, but it felt like it while I was getting the scrub done)!",12,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I called and ordered a Big Sexy--a pie with sausage, pepperoni, garlic, onion, and pepperoncini.  It is offered in two sizes--14 inch regular and an 18 inch ""big pie.""

I was home in a few minutes and the pizza was still warm but not hot.  It was a good pizza with a nice crust and plenty of toppings.

We had leftover slices that I froze and I would remove one from the freezer the night before I was going to have it for breakfast.  Leftover, cold pizza--talk about breakfast of champions!

This is basically a take out place.  There are only a few tables in the tiny restaurant.  The name is not above the door outside but rather in the window.  

Finally, if it matters to you, Those Guys Pies was on an episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  II first heard about the place from a couple from New York who like to try Triple D places when they travel.  Because of the lack of seating, they ended up heating the warm pizza in 100 degree weather in Desert Breeze Park.  That speaks to the lack of dining space inside.

They serve a very credible pizza and I'll be back.",14,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The grilled vegetables were very good.  I always like their roasted garlic pieces, but this night, the roast beef was cooked until the cow could walk no more.  It was deep, deep brown.  Overcooked completely!

The spicy tofu in the Asian section was very good and the deserts rounded out the evening on the plus side.  I had some peach ice cream and a piece of carrot cake.  A nice way to end a meal.

The service was very good.  There weren't very many people in the restaurant Sunday night so the servers were stretched to the limit.

The dealership has improved their wifi and it's now quite fast.  After I was done with the paper, I watched HBO Go on my iPhone.

I also got a new service rep today, Dave Margo, and he was excellent.  He came in twice to update me on the status of my repair and I appreciate knowing what's going on.  They had to reprogram a new keyless remote fob for my car and it was resisting.

IqCvkoDvvImXuzGrpeiDMA,8,2015-01-02,3,Yy0sc6ZNPMzrkCmlcvX5xQ,4,"Two of us started 2015 off with a special New Year's Day brunch at Border Grill normally offered only on weekends.  Offered our choice of any table becasue we were the first people there, we chose to sit on the indoor patio along the Forum Shops. It was also well lighted for better photos.  It's always fun to watch tourists.  

We started with two complimentary guava empanadas and a bowl of fresh fruit before ordering.

Between the two of us, we ordered (descriptions from their menu):

Yucatan egg Benedict - manchego cheese biscuit, achiote roasted pork, avocado crema, hollandaise, pickled onions (2 orders)

Green corn tamales - sweet corn, salsa fresca, sour cream (1 order)

Fried green tomatillos - triple cream brie, hominy grits, spicy romesco, smoked chile hollandaise, pepper bacon  (1 order)

Bacon jalapeño PBJ - housemade peanut butter and grape jelly, crispy bacon, over easy egg, jalapeño  (2 orders)

Chicken and waffle - blue corn waffle, mango habanero coulis, spiced fried chicken, crème fraîche  (2 orders)

Peruvian shrimp and grits - aji panca salsa, roasted green chile, creamy parmesan grits (1 order)

Red velvet Johnny cakes - ancho chocolate shavings, candied pecans, wild berry syrup, vanilla crème fraîche (1 order)

Egg white oysters Rockefeller - seasonal tempura oyster, creamed spinach, crispy bacon, spicy tomato chutney (1 order)

Huevos rancheros - black bean panucho, ranchero salsa, sunny side egg, tomatillo relish, serrano chantilly (1 order)

Breakfast fries - beer braised short rib, chipotle hollandaise, applewood smoked bacon, over easy egg (1 order)

Churro tots - dulce de leche infused churros, cinnamon sugar, cajeta (1 order)

Capirotada French toast - bourbon maple syrup, walnuts, ancho cherry marmalade, goat cheese crema (1 order)

Rice pudding - shortbread cookie, brûléed banana slices (1 order)

The Border Grill brunch is an all you can eat menu with a cost of $34.99.  We ordered two dishes at a time and they were generally brought out at the same time or close to each other.  Where it's indicated 2 orders, we each got one.  Neither one of us repeated any dishes and we didn't share except for the churro tots and the rice pudding--a $9.00 up charge because it's not one of the brunch dishes which total 16.

My favorites were: Yucatan egg Benedict, fried green tomatillos, bacon jalapeño PBJ, shrimp and grits, chicken and waffle, churro tots, and rice pudding--basically everything I ordered.  The chicken and waffle was quite deceptive.  At first, I thought the mango habanero coulis was too sweet until I got a slice of habanero and the rest of the habanero flavor kicked in.  No longer sweet, it was a tasty, zingy dish.  The shrimp and grits were very good as was the bacon jalapeño PBJ.  The peanut butter was excellent and with the jelly and bacon, the biscuit had a very flavorful counterpoint.

Finishing off, the churro tots were good but the rice pudding was exceptional.  The pudding is well worth the up charge.  The portion is huge--easily shared--and it's a great finish to a wonderful brunch. 

Service except for one blip was exceptional.  Coffee was not refilled.  New cups of coffee were brought to replace empty or almost empty cups.  Someone was around often changing the coffee cups and adding water to our glasses.  The general manager, Jennifer, came early to introduce herself and welcome us to Border Grill.  She explained some of the designing done by Feniger/Milliken or their families, and we talked about the way some of their dishes are made.  Jennifer stopped at almost every table while we were there to make sure guests were satisfied or had any questions.

One of the others at the table ordered a large pizza with pineapple and mushrooms--the pineapple being a first for me.  It was such a pity when there were three pieces of pizza left over and she couldn't take it home with her.  She was winging back to Canada the next morning.  I made the sacrifice and took one for the team.  I brought the three pieces home, had one for dinner, and have the other two frozen for a lunch treat!

Yes, I like Republica Empanada
And getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into (fried) plantains

OK I don't really like getting caught in the rain but the rest holds true! I tried some yuca frita and several empanadas. I went into a food coma shortly afterwards. Then I woke up and wrote this review. :)

The yuca frita were lightly crispy with great starchy flavor. I love them as an alternative to your standard French fries. I wasn't a big fan of the ranch it was served with though, it tasted weird to me. We had the Republica chicken, El Capitan, chicken and mushroom and cheeseburger empanadas. My favorites were the El Capitan and the Republica chicken. The mushroom and chicken came in a close third. The cheeseburger, while technically tasting like a cheeseburger, was the sort of novelty filling you get but then realize you'd rather be eating a regular cheeseburger over this version. The empanada crust itself was great: crispy yet slightly tender, cooked until golden brown.

Service was friendly but a bit sluggish. The iced teas we ordered were refreshing and came in a gigantic cup.

The parking lot is small but there is street parking along the restaurant.

If I'm in the area again I'll definitely stop by for more empanadas and maybe some fried plantains. :)

QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA,11,2014-08-24,6,Pc8cevntppksAckYR9qj7Q,3,"I had eaten once at the Griddle Cafe on Sunset Boulevard in LA so I was really looking forward to having one in my home town.  Yesterday was opening day for the general public at the Griddle Cafe in its new home in the SLS Hotel and Casino.

Three of us met here so we could enjoy a number of different items.  We ordered two pancake selections and two French toast selections and specified the order in which we wanted to get the selections with a time out period between the two waves.  We also ordered coffee.  All their coffee is served French press style and you can choose the boldness of the coffee.

As for the food, we got two pancakes of Mouthful of You, three of Sow Your Oats, 2 slices of Devil's Daydream French toast, and two slices of Peanut Bubba French toast.    Flavors were excellent for all these breakfast items.  The Mouthful of Yum were brown sugar pancakes with banana and crushed Butterfingers with Godiva Chocolate Liqueur.  This was topped with a dollop of whipped cream which was also flavored with Godiva chocolate liqueur.  It was yum!  Rounding out the first course was the Peanut Bubba crunchy French toast.   Bread dipped in peanut butter crunch and topped with whipped cream and powdered sugar!  Truly a delight!  

Course two soon started with the Sow Your Oats pancakes--we got three although we ordered a short stack.  Along with this we got the Devil's Daydream Bourbon French Toast.  The cakes were made with cinnamon, honey and rolled oats.  They were good but I found the cakes to be a bit dry.  I put some maple syrup on my slices, something I rarely do.  The Devil's Daydream French toast was made from chocolate bread that had been loaded with bittersweet chocolate chips.  The cooked bourbon was very evident in the flavor of the French toast.  Of the two, my winner was the French toast again.

Understand when you go here, the pancakes are huge.  They are the size of a regular plate.  Leftovers are packed for customers in small pizza like boxes so make sure you order wisely.  Having three of us share helped destroy our tasty selections except for a small bit leftover.

Now, the service, and the reason for only 3 stars.  The food is hands down 5 stars.  The service was awful.  Our initial server seemed oblivious to the fact we were there and lacked common sense.  He brought coffee for the 3rd person who came a bit late, but we had to almost trip him to get a cup so our friend could enjoy his coffee.  At the same time, he dropped off a glass of ice cubes and left without saying a word.  I watched him and eventually he picked up a pitcher of water and came over.

About this time, we requested to see the manager and she was little help except for giving us excuses.  Opening day, worked graveyard shift, one of our best servers.  Really, you know this after one graveyard shift.  We were assigned a new server who was top notch.  All the while we waited trying to get service from the original server, we watched a comedy show, in a way, near the entrance.  See my photo here:

The outdoor patio has multiple tables and tufted couch seating areas to accommodate any number of guests. Our party of 20+ people took up 3 couch areas and there was still room for a baby shower being hosted right next to us with an equally large number of people. Note that they do not accept reservations for large parties unless you are willing to go through their event planner, so if you are going to try to get a large group together here for a more informal outing come early to claim your space!

The games offered here are ping pong, cornhole, and I did see a foosball table in the corner. There are about 4-5 tables of ping pong and an equal number of cornhole boards. You can rent the equipment with an ID, and it's first come first serve.

The food and drinks are from Culinary Dropout, and we ordered a few appetizers to share. The pretzel fondue is always a sure winner, and I also enjoyed the pork belly nachos as well. The hummus had a beautiful presentation but was just OK to me. I also tried some potato chips which were delightfully crunchy and crispy, with a dip that tasted like a mix of ranch and French onion dip.

The outdoor patio is semi-secluded with high wooden walls but enough open space to let you see the surrounding area. Oftentimes you will see either the Light Rail or freight trains go by. The music here is loud enough that you won't really hear anything going on outside the restaurant and when we were here they had a live performance by someone doing cover songs.

Service was good and we were checked on as needed. Since all the servers here look like they stepped out of an Urban Outfitters ad and there isn't any standard dress for them, it's hard to tell who is working here and who is here as a paying customer.

My server came quickly and took my drink order--some iced green tea.  We then talked about appetizers that wouldn't be too large.  I didn't want to order something meant for sharing.  I asked about the ahi tuna ceviche and he said that would be good for a single diner.  I ordered that and the Le Quack Japonais for my main course.

I was brought the ahi ceviche as it was excellent.  The yuzu and white soy marinade was very good!  It was a 3 ounce serving and just perfect for a starter.

Then same Le Quack.  The duck was fantastic!  It came with condiments for putting on the duck in the mushu wraps.  There were four items--a mango chutney with some red pepper, Japanese cabbage shreds, green onion ends also shredded and some spicy plum sauce. I was surprised that I ate all the wraps but one with my meal.  The toppings were so good and great accompaniments to the very good duck!

Next up, dessert.  I asked my server about different desserts.  I opted for the most popular one, the Kabocha cheesecake.  It's a cheesecake with a crust made from crushed almond cookies, with a layer of Japanese pumpkin cheesecake, topped by a layer of five spice  pineapple mousse.  The cheesecake is not as creamy as some we're used to because of the circular pot in which it's baked.  But, take the spoon and go down through the pineapple mousse and grab some of the pumpkin and the combination is outstanding!  A real winner.

Service throughout the evening was first rate!  It turned out that my server, David, was the captain.  He was polite, helpful, and friendly!

I'll mention my server right in the beginning.  Kathleen was perfect.  She helped explain the dishes when I had questions, she recommended certain dishes as potential tries, but she wasn't in the business of pushing more plates.  She was great!  After telling me most people order three, she suggested I try two and see how much that filled me up and decide then.

For starters, I ordered the white onion soup velouté and the tarte flambée.  The onion soup was excellent.  It was very good and the velouté gave it a different taste but there was still the flavor of onion coming through nicely.  The I got the tarte flambée.  It's a flatbread with bacon, asparagus, truffle, crème fraiche, and and onion.  This, too, was a tasty small plate and quite a different take on standard flatbreads.

I wasn't full yet, so I stayed in France--the menu is divided into different countries--and I got the seared foie gras with braised beef cheek and shallot jus.  This was outstanding.  The foie gras was excellent.  I've only had one other foie gras that would hands down beat this one.

I still had a little room, so I just had to order dessert.  The menu lists exotic panna cotta.  This was a small glass jar with a layer of pineapple panna cotta on the bottom and then a layer of coconut.   On top was some fresh fruit, some coconut and some crisps that gave the dessert a wonderful texture.

This was a very pleasant dining experience.  It's amazing how quickly small plates can add up when you get your bill.

After poring through each delicious item on the menu (I seriously wanted one of each, can I just order a whole cow and work my way through?) I was intrigued by the steak farina. I like steak, I like eggs, so I should like steak with egg on top, especially if it's a 28 day aged bone in filet mignon! I also got the corn creme brulee as a side to complete my meal. As for appetizers, we shared the crispy shrimp.

The complimentary bread we had was delicious. It had a savory buttery top with very soft dough. The shrimp came next and were fried perfectly, with a light crunchy batter and just the right amount of sauce, with a little bit of heat from the chiles. 

I absolutely loved the steak farina. The filet was a sight to behold, a perfectly cooked medium-rare, gustatory delight. It was very tender and well seasoned. The actual meat had so much flavor which is impressive since I've oftentimes found filet mignon to be very tender but not taste as good as ribeye. It makes me wonder how much more flavor their ribeye has if the filet is that good! The egg on top was a perfect sunny side up, and provided some creaminess to the earthy, primal taste of the beef. Forget ordering food a la mode, I want all my meals to be a l'oeuf now!

The creme brulee corn was not bruleed that much but it was sweet, creamy, rich and indulgent, a perfect side to go with the beef and egg.

Service was impeccable and everyone was working together to make our dining experience enjoyable. A manager even came over to make sure we were happy with our meal. 

Since we were celebrating a birthday they brought out a special warm vanilla cake with gelato and sliced pecans on top. Oh so good. We were so stuffed by the time we were finished here!

Even the bathrooms are super swanky and posh. This is the first bathroom I've seen that has its own dedicated hat rack. 

So for some of the best steak and service around, Steak 44 is a 100 in my book!",29,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Rodizio Grill offers two different price structures: For $19.99 you can have the all you can eat salad bar only, or for $29.99 you can have the unlimited salad and meat skewers.

We started our food journey by being offered fried bananas and fried polenta with cheese at our table. Both were delicious and were a good way to begin our meal.

For those uninitiated into Brazilian style BBQ, servers will come to your table with their skewers and you can choose which ones you want to sample. When we were here they had top sirloin, tri tip, lamb, bacon wrapped chicken, bacon wrapped beef, chicken hearts, chicken thighs, sausage, sweet and spicy chicken, and I did spy a table getting some grilled pineapple that I unfortunately didn't get to try before I ran out of room in my stomach. 

The salad bar had a wide variety of items to try, such as make your own salad, coconut pineapple coleslaw, beets, candied bacon, and ceviche. There was also a hot foods area with selections like collard greens, feijoada, and brisket stew. They were all decent, about what you'd expect from a buffet style of food.

Most of the red meat skewers were well done by the time we got them, although the lamb skewers were nicely medium rare. The seasoning level was OK for me especially since other churrasco restaurants put too much salt on their meat. 

I indulged in a caipirinha which was very strong. If you're into heavy handed drinks this is your place!

For dessert we shared the rabanada and some flan. The rabanada was similar to a cinnamon sugar donut, with a creamy tapioca-like center. The ice cream it was served with was a great accompaniment. The flan was excellent with rich creamy custard flavor and caramel syrup.

Service was superb. We were checked up on frequently and everyone wanted to make sure we were enjoying our meals.

Overall it was a pleasant experience. If I want to indulge in eating from a parade of meats this is a good place to go!",24,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

After picking up my knives from Phoenix Knife House across the street, I spied the German Sausage Company and thought, what better way to celebrate having a wicked sharp knife again than to get a few sausages for dinner? Sausages and knives, it brings out the primal beast in us all! 

The shop itself is well organized and holds not only cured meat, but jarred condiments, crackers, cookies, all German brands. Off to the far side of the case there were two trays of delectable bienenstich for sale. I couldn't resist and got a piece for $2.40. I looked at all the freshly made sausages and cured slabs o'meat and had a hard time deciding what to get, it all looked so good!

I asked the lovely ladies at the counter, ""So what's something I can only get at this shop that I won't be able to get at another place that sells sausages?""

Both replied, ""Everything!""

Looking at the sausage selection, I decided to get the curry bratwurst, debreziner, and weisswurst sausages, 1/2 pound of each. For your reference each sausage is about 1/4 lbs. 

The sausages are all fully cooked so they just need that extra finishing touch to warm them up. Also note that there are no preservatives in the sausages so use them up as soon as you can. I grilled the curry bratwurst and debreziner and boiled the weisswurst. Each sausage had a distinct flavor and were superb. The debreziner had a deep smoky flavor with a slightly thicker tasting casing that allowed for a good ""snap"" when you bit into it. The meat itself was perfectly seasoned, and very tender. The curry bratwurst looked more pale than I'm used to seeing in bratwurst sausages, and tasted more delicate. It had a hint of curry that could easily be overpowered if you ate it with a strong tasting condiment. The weisswurst was the most delicate tasting of the bunch, and paired wonderfully flavor-wise with some sweet hot mustard I had in the house. The traditional way to eat these sausages is to boil them over simmering heat, then removing the casing.

The bienenstich was a layered bit of German bliss. The cake was a perfect density, with custardy cream and toasted shaved almonds on top. I loved the combination of textures and flavors. 

Service was very sweet and friendly. Note that they are cash or check only though so be prepared.

I was greeted promptly and taken to a table on the far side of the bar and down a few steps.  It's the last area before you go to their patio.  I had a view of the pool area and one of Caesars iconic Roman statues in a columned structure.

My server, Howard, quickly appeared and asked for my drink order.  He brought my iced tea quickly.  Having read about the size of Rao's portion, I was careful to choose wisely.  I went with the baked clams for an appetizer and the ravioli purses for the main course.

I was soon brought a nice bread basket.  Howard asked me if I wanted some balsamic with the olive oil and I declined.  I poured some of the oil onto the plate, salted it a bit, and then dipped some of the olive bread that was part of the basket.

Within a short time, my baked clams were delivered.  They are littleneck clams that had an oregano bread crumb topping.  I squeezed some lemon on the clams and dug in.  It's been a long time since I got baked clams and they were great!  The lemon mixed with the juices from the clams and I had another dipping ""sauce"" for my bread.  Very tasty!

The main course came. Rao's calls them beggar purse ravioli.  The ravioli were stuffed with a mixture of pear and ricotta cheese and they were in a sauce of brown butter seasoned with sage and topped with dried cranberries.  This caught my eye when I was reading the menu because it was such a different dish.  It was excellent, too!  The pear taste with the cheese was very mild and the butter with the dried cranberries was a true winner!  A good dish that's really different.  Also, I had dipping sauce #3--the brown butter with sage was a wonderful place to dip a few cubes of the good bread.

For dessert, I asked Howard for his advice.  He gave me a listing of the entire dessert menu without having to bring one to me.  Of the things on the menu, he recommended one, the peanut butter tart, something his wife makes--she's one of the pastry chefs at Rao's.  The tart had a graham cracker crust, a layer of chocolate ganache, and it was topped with peanut butter mousse.  It was superb!  I'll have the other dessert he recommended on my next visit.

The dinner was very very good!  Service was exemplary.  The staff or Howard was always around to refill water, get more iced tea, remove dirty dishes, and simply to do a great job!  I am a big fan of Rao's.",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

For an appetizer, we ordered the medhu wada, two deep fried doughnuts made from ground lentils, rice, and black pepper.  With it was served three chutneys or sauces that added some to the dryness of the wada.  The sauces were a tomato based one, a soup, and a coconut based one.

I don't like freezing in a place either and I always take a denim long sleeve shirt with me.  I sure didn't need it as I was perspiring and it wasn't from the curry.  Speaking of that, 7 is not high enough for a good spice level.  Their 7 was rather tame and the curry seemed to be lacking some of the rich flavor it should have.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by Thai curry.  I think I need to stay away from indian curry.  The kheer had no pistachio chunks on it which somewhat makes the dish interesting.  I saw the photo that Westie W. posted and I thought that it was really enticing.  The no regular iced tea threw me.  I was going to ask them if I could have some hot water and a tea bag and a glass of ice.  I could have made my own.  Out of iced tea is so lame.

The woman greeted me warmly and she knew I was a neophyte.  She explained the menu to me.  I chose the healthy portion--6 ounces of rib eye and the vegetables that come with it.  She then helped me choose the cooking liquid.  I went with the spicy miso broth and it was very good.  

Shortly after placing my order, the platter of meat was placed in front of me and an assortment of jars of spices, sesame oil, mixed pepper spice and the vegetables were put down and I was left to do my thing.

I really wasn't sure exactly how to attack the cooking.  Do I put in a fair amount of vegetables and let them simmer and then cook some beef quickly and then remove.  I just winged it and did things the way I guessed it should be.  I had one empty bowl, for liquid I figured, and a small plate for the solid food.

My thoughts range along these lines:

It's a lot of work for what? 
It tended to be a bit messy for me.
I think a slotted spoon or mesh ladle would have been nice to have to aid removing some of the harder things from the pot.
There was nothing that stood out about the meal except the spicy miso soup left after cooking the meat and vegetables in the broth.
Why is it that most Asian restaurants with a sushi bar assume that a person eating alone wants to sit at the bar?  I found the height of the burner and pot on the counter to be harder to get to.

Price with one iced tea (I was never asked nor offered a refill) was just under $19.  Add tip and you have an expensive meal for not much food and I did all the work. 

For $20, I'll go to any other Asian restaurant and I'll be served and not have to screw around with a burner.  I'm glad I tried this once.  I'll be eating elsewhere in the future.",1,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Meats are available by the half pound, and include 4 slices of bread for a 1/2 pound order. Sides include coleslaw, potato salad, creamed corn, green chile stew, new potatoes, and corn on the cob (Just to name a few!). 

I liked that they had different options for your brisket. Usually at bbq places I go to it is typically the ""lean"" brisket you get, but here at Rudy's you can decide between ""moist"" (AKA fatty) brisket, lean brisket, and ""Chef's choice"" brisket (I'd imagine this to be the leftover bits of what is carved, since it's cheaper than the other options). 

As this was our first time here, the cashier gave us a sample of the lean brisket and the turkey. Both were very flavorful and moist. I'd definitely get either meat in the future. As for my actual meal, I opted for the moist brisket with a side of green chile stew. The order was made quickly.

After you pay, there is a station for condiments that include various peppers, onions, pickles, and packets of sauces (Ketchup, mustard, horseradish). There are also straws and napkins here. The soda fountain is stocked with Coke products, and they also offer sweet and unsweetened tea.

Seating is self serve, and we found a cozy little wooden table stocked with various hot sauces, a ""sissy"" sauce, and a regular bbq sauce. The regular bbq sauce had a nice vinegary tang, with a slight kick of spice. The ""sissy"" sauce to me tasted very similar, except not as hot spice-wise. 

The moist brisket was indeed very moist, with unctuous veins of fat running through the meat. I could taste a deep smoky flavor too. The green chile stew was excellent. It was served piping hot, with a superb savory, spicy flavor. 

Overall, a nice place to go for some good bbq. I'll definitely be coming here again to try more of their bbq meats!",4,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Standard chips and 4 salsas were brought.  The salsas are tomatillo, fire roasted tomato, regular tomato salsa, and a bean dip.  They're all good, but my favorite is the fire roasted.

We started with table side made guacamole, and it was very good.  I got it not spicy because my wife is the ultimate gringa.  I put all the peppers on my side of the bowl after our server had finished.  How gringa is she you ask?  If you wave a pepper over the plate, she'll say it's too spicy.  Enough said.

For the main course, I got the carne asada platter, slices of skirt steak with pasilla chiles and cotija cheese.  With it comes a cheese enchilada, some pico, and sides of veggies and black beans (my choice but there are other beans or Mexican potatoes available.  My wife had the pollo ranchero.  It's the most gringa thing on the menu.  She also had the sides but thought they were spicy (they weren't).  Each entree comes with a salad with your choice of dressing.  I've always thought this was odd for a Mexican restaurant.

For dessert, we shared a chocolate pecan ball which is a vanilla bean ice cream ball dipped in chopped pecans and has chocolate drizzled over it!  It was excellent.

This little piggie stayed home,
This little piggie went to Oink Cafe,
And got turned into a bacon flight!

We got here at 9 AM on a Sunday and there was a 30 minute wait to be seated. Well.... ""Better be worth it"" I thought! It did allow me ample time to browse through the menu. They currently serve breakfast and lunch, with breakfast favorites such as omelets, Benedicts, and more Southwestern offerings such as the mighty breakfast chimi. Breakfast chimi or omelet? Hmm... Well I didn't feel like eating my weight in breakfast today so I went with the pork confit omelet! We also split the bacon flight.

The bacon flight came with a slice each of applewood smoked, honey cured, jalapeno, peppered, sugar cured, apple cider, hickory smoked and pecanwood smoked. Some of the pieces tasted very similar to each other. Out of all the slices my favorite was probably the apple cider due to the blend of light sweetness with the saltiness of the pork. The jalapeno was also notable for its spicy kick and I also enjoyed the applewood smoked bacon due to its light, almost fruity, smoky flavor.

I haven't ordered many items at a restaurant listed as confit so I was excited to try the cafe's version of it. The omelet was a sizable meal, coming with your choice of vegetable and starch. I chose the home fries and biscuit. The omelet itself was decent. The eggs weren't super fluffy and were just slightly too overcooked for my tastes. There was plentiful filling of pork, cheese and onion though. The menu listed it as having jalapeno in it too but I couldn't taste any of it in mine. The confit itself unfortunately was a little disappointing to me. For a meat that's been slow cooked for a long time at a low temperature I was hoping it would be amazingly, meltingly tender. The meat wasn't super tender, but it wasn't tough either. It also tasted bland compared to the powerfully rich red chile ranchero sauce on top. I did enjoy the sauce but felt it overpowered the whole dish because all I could taste was sauce with each bite.

The biscuit was decent and the potatoes with bell pepper and onion were a bit oily but plentiful. We also had coffee which was also decent and was refilled as needed.

Service was average. There were so many people here to serve that I didn't really expect a lot of personal attention here anyways.

Since there were so many people here it was pretty loud in the restaurant. If you're looking for a relaxing place to enjoy and unwind this isn't going to be your spot, at least when it's super busy on Sunday morning.

The restaurant takes up residence where Marcello's Pasta Grill used to be. They changed the decor considerably, to a lime green and bright yellow interior.  The bar is still here though so they do serve beer, mimosas and bloody Marys if you feel like having an alcoholic beverage. They also kept the nicely shaded patio which I'm sure will be a great spot to dine at once the weather gets warmer.

Overall, about an average experience food wise and service wise.",16,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Unsure of when the laundry room problem would actually be fixed, we bit the bullet and headed over to Eco Laundry to wash, wash, wash, and dry, dry, dry those massive piles of laundry!  

We were immediately greeted by the cheerful associate, who encouraged us to ask him for help if we needed anything.  They have change machines, and vending machines with snacks, drinks, and laundry supplies if you've forgotten or run out of a few items.  The machines were clean, as were the floors, and there were many different washers to fit your load needs (1, 3, 5, and 6 load washers).  We went here on a busier night, but had no problem with getting the type of machines we needed, or getting a dryer.  They also have carts for you to place your laundry when transporting it to the dryers.  

I was impressed by the associate here.  I don't know his name, but he was a young gentleman with a thick (Scottish?) accent, but I commend him for his devotion to work!  He was constantly moving from area to area, cleaning the floors, and cleaning the inside of the machines to make sure everything was spotless.

I, like some others, was concerned about parking.  I had several thoughts in mind, but in the end, I used ParkMobile to buy a spot and I chose the Aria event garage.  Everything went smoothly.

I bought my ticket online and printed it out so there was no problem with admission to the event.  The lines were long for the scanners but they moved along and before long I was inside the arena with my ticket scanned by a pleasant young woman who told me the way to go for my seats.

I was not going to spend the multi-hundreds of dollars for the better seats and I abhor floor seats.  They're flat and you just can't see over people in front of you.  I opted for an upper level--the highest upper level.  I got a seat in Row B about in the middle.  I knew when I chose the seat that I'd be closer to the stage than at the horseshoe end of the arena and the seat was just fine albeit Streisand was a mere little thing on the stage below.  I left my binoculars in the car but the big screen is good enough if you want to see a performer larger than they appear from where you're sitting.

At the end of the concert, I started to wait for the people to leave the upper rows so I could get out, too.  I then got the idea of hopping over the Row A seats which I did and I went along the row to the end of that area and walked directly to that level's plaza.  The line for the escalators was large so I walked down the stairs instead ending outside across from the center of the Aria Event garage parking.  I walked toward the front of the arena and somewhat jaywalked to get across before the Metro officer started allowing traffic to move along the street.

The line for the elevators was long at the garage so I walked up the five floors to where my reserved parking was.  A double days worth of gym workout yesterday.  All traffic leaving the garage must turn right and exit north along Frank Sinatra Drive which is exactly the way I wanted to go.  From the end of the concert to my house was 30 minutes.  Not bad at all.

All the staff I came into contact with at the garage or at the arena were very helpful and friendly.  Now that I've been here once, I know thew easy way for me in and out.  You could park at the regular Aria garage and walk over, but I found the paid parking was easier and worth the extra price unless I was staying after an event for some reason.

We were seated and served water, and proceeded to wait.... and wait.... and wait.... while we saw both waiters serve other tables but never go to ours to actually take our order despite staring at them and attempting to flag them down.  After 10 minutes we managed to flag down the busboy who served us our water, to ask him to tell our waiter that we were ready to order.  Another 10 minutes goes by, and we see no sign of any waiter, just the busboy.  We consider leaving, but ask the busboy again if the waiter is coming to take our order.  Despite the busboy telling him that we needed someone to come by, the waiter apparently did not feel that we needed to be served anything since he still hadn't come by to even tell us his name.  We ended up taking our orders through the busboy, and he ended up doing most of the waiter's job for him.  

The food itself?  A bit expensive, but tasty, depending on what you get.  Some of the dishes that had chicharones (pork cracklings) had slices of pork skin in the meal rather than mashed up bits.  I wasn't a big fan of this, since the chicharones, when rehydrated, taste really rubbery and bland when left as a small strip instead of being mashed up with the rest of the ingredients.  As for the rest of the food we tried, the pollo parilla was very good.  It was tender, with a nice tropical tasting marinade that matched with the chicken very well.  I wanted to try a bunch of items, so we also had the San Juan sampler, which consists of several of the appetizers in one plate.  The best item in the sampler was the Puerto Rican style tamal.  It had a very moist masa filling and was flavorful.

In the end, I personally gave our tip to the busboy, since he pretty much did most of the actual waiter's job at our table, since I only saw the real waiter for probably a total of 30 seconds.",3,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

** If you see a faded sign by the side of the road that says
15 miles to the, Loving Hut! Loving Hut yeah
I'm headin' down the Phoenix highway, lookin' for the vegan getaway
Heading for the vegan getaway, vegan getaway,
I got me a car, it's as big as a whale and we're headin' on down
To the Loving Hut... **

The song coursed through my head a few times as I ventured in and browsed through the menu (**Loving Hut baby! Loving Hut bay-bee...**). I was on a limited time schedule so I got the lemongrass chicken ($9.50) and a slice of carrot cake ($4.50) to go. Although prices seemed a bit high and that I could get lemongrass chicken made with real chicken for cheaper somewhere else, I was hopeful for a good quality meal. It took maybe 10-15 minutes for it to be made and packaged, and the cake was already prepackaged in their dessert counter. The packaging itself is paper-based and thus eco-friendly, as are their to-go bags. 

The lemongrass chicken was a generous portion of soy chunks, deep-fried, and then covered in a pungent lemongrass mixture. The texture of the ""chicken"" was kind of like a mix between fish and chicken, and was tender on the inside. The pieces were nicely seasoned and had a nice outer crunch from the deep-frying. The ""chicken"" nuggets were placed on a bed of romaine, with a slice of carrot and cucumber. As for the carrot cake, it was also a generous serving, filled with freshly grated carrot and large chunks of nuts. I loved the light, whipped topping. The ingredients themselves were great, however, it did taste slightly dry to me.

One thing to note, is that rice is not automatically included with the entrees, and will cost you $1. 

Off to the side of the cash register, there's a small section of vegetarian goods, such as fake beef and chicken. They even sell a vegan dog food!

So, even if you're an omnivore, it's a good place to get a flavorful meal. I doubt you will miss the meat! And remember,

After looking through the extensive array of flavors offered for drinks (Fruity, coffee, or creamy/milk-based to name a few) I decided on a small hot almond milk tea with boba and had the popcorn chicken combo with rice ($6.50). I also tried some of the beef noodle soup. 

The almond milk tea had the perfect amount of almond flavor and was not super sweet which I greatly appreciated. The popcorn chicken was excellent. It was served with a soy sauce marinated egg, marinated tofu, pickled vegetables, cabbage, and a heaping mound of rice. The beef noodle soup was decent and had a lighter flavor than others I've tried.

Service was friendly (A big step up from when it was Lollicup!) and our drinks and food took only a short time to be made. 

I'll definitely be back to try more of their food and drinks! They also sell diamond ice (Korean style shaved ice AKA patbingsu) which I will have to try as well. :)

Seated in the private (semi-private) room, we started with appetizer pastries (that's what I'll call them).  They ranged from sticky buns, to cinnamon buns, scones, and croissants among others.  Each one was absolutely wonderful.  Chef Blinn shows his skill with these pastries.  

Following this, we had our savory dishes which included shrimp and grits, Citrus and crab salad, Ciabatta Caprese, crustless quiche of the day, short rib fries, Croque monsieur panini, and chorizo Shepherd's pie.  I didn't get a chance to try the citrus and crab salad but everything else was outstanding.  I enjoyed the panini and the Ciabatta Caprese as well as the quiche.  Everything is thought out so well and they're very good dishes.

After the main dishes, it was time for more pastries that I'll refer to as dessert pastries.  These included mango sticky rice, S'mores waffles, a chocolate sticky bun, and a duo of bread pudding and sticky toffee pudding.

Service was excellent with new share plates and silverware for each course without needing to ask.  Refills of my iced tea were frequent and again with no need to ask.

Chef Blinn's desire to turn out quality pastries and savory dishes is evident in everything I tried.  He's a very dedicated man who makes his food with quality ingredients and has a menu that is very diverse such that anyone coming here can find many things to like.  You're not going away disappointed.

It's a shame it's a 20 minute drive from home to get here or I'd be buying pastries more than I do now.  Getting some of these pastries in the future will be worth the trip!",17,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We each ordered a po-boy planning to split and share so we could taste more than one kind.  I chose the cajun sausage and my friend chose the fried shrimp.  The woman taking our order wanted to know if we wanted that as a combo which gets you onion rings, fries, or potato salad and a drink.  We chose the combo for the extra value rather than ordering the items separately.

We took our drinks to the room adjoining the ordering area and waited for the po-boys.  It wasn't long before a server brought the sandwiches to us.

I liked both but my favorite was the cajun sausage.  It had some heat to it.  The shrimp was OK but they were small fried shrimp with a bit of cajun like flavoring on them.  The fries and onion rings are OK.  The standout here is the bread.  It's Leidenheimer's bread and it makes the sandwich.  Without it, the sandwiches would be less than OK.

Zydeco is an OK place if you're in DTLV but it's not a place I'd go out of my way to get a sandwich.  There are other better choices albeit they won't be po=boys.",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The area was littered with spilled coffee beans from people and the shelf below the holding tubes had four or five bags with different amounts of beans that were just left there.

When I went to add beans to the hopper of the grinder, it was 3/4 full with beans someone had just dumped in there and left.  The top of the grinder where the beans go was filthy with grounds from previously ground beans and loose beans.  The whole area was disgusting.

I didn't buy any coffee here.  Instead, I went to the checkout and left.  When I got home, I looked for one item I knew I had picked up.  It was then I realized she hadn't bagged it and it was still at the store--I guess.  That's my mistake for not checking.

I had a question about the Burn Your Face Off burger and with Alejandro's description, I opted to go with something that would leave my face in tact--overhaul though it needs.  I ordered the Land and sea burger which the menu describes as Angus Beef, CRAB DYNAMITE, Red Onions, Fennel, Arugula, Breakfast Radishes, Havarti Cheese, Tomato Tartar Sauce, Hawaiian Sweet Bun.  I asked for it rare and that's the way it came.  My wife ordered the Dr. Pepper/Shroom burger that the menu describes as Angus Beef, Roasted Portabella, White Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, DR. PEPPER GLAZE, Dijon Mustard, Brioche Bun done medium which was the way it was done.  We each ordered skinny fries which come with your sandwich.

Both burgers were very good.  I was pleased that my burger was indeed rare, something that some restaurants are hesitant to do.  The burgers were very large--probably 8 ounces.  My burger, while having a good amount of crab, didn't have much of a crab taste.  The crab was mined and mixed with a hot sauce to be the dynamite mentioned in the menu.  There wasn't much dynamite to it, but the burger was good.  The skinny fries were salted in the kitchen and were the perfect accompaniment to the burger.

For dessert, we split the To Die For Chocolate which the menu describes as Chocolate Ice Cream, Frozen Brownie Bites, TOASTED MARSHMALLOWS, Crème Anglaise.  This was very good.  Very chocolatey--very worthy of its name!

Throughout our meal, service was top notch.  Our iced teas were refilled without needing to ask.  Alejandro was very good!

Café 6 would probably rate another star if there was more of a choice.  Except for burgers and sandwiches, there are only two ""main course"" options--salmon and steak frites--so it's a burger and sandwich café with some apps, salads, and desserts.  There is an option to build your own burger.  The price of the burgers amounts to Strip pricing in an off-Strip place.  While the room and the view of the pool are very nice, this isn't a stop I'd make.  It's much easier to get gourmet burgers in the neighborhood at more reasonable prices.  For tourists staying at the Palms or Palms Place, this is a perfectly good option.",17,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

It was rich, packed with pistachio nutty flavor, with a smooth texture.

Service was good and the cashier happily let us try multiple flavors before deciding on our desserts. My small cup was a little less than $4. Overall, a good place to satisfy your sweet tooth if you're in the area.",3,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Seating didn't take long and we were shown to a table.  Within a short time, our waiter, Rocco--one of the stars of our dinner--arrived to greet us and to ask about water/drinks.

I ordered iced tea and my dining companion got a cocktail.  It was then time to peruse the menu and decide what we wanted.  While looking at the menu, Rocco brought us a selection of bread--some breadsticks, a round baked load, some lavash, and an assortment of spices and dips for the bread and for later in the meal.

We ordered the same salad, the tricolore--with prosciutto, gorgonzola, dates, walnuts, tuscan kale, yellow endive, and radicchio.  The salad was the other star of the evening.  It was simply superb!  The dressing and the textures of the various ingredients were so good.  I did put some of the salt from the bread board on the salad. 

For my main course, I got the fregolotto--with morel mushrooms, baby zucchini, and squash blossoms.  The cheese grated on the pasta, shaped like large tapioca, and the zucchini gave the pasta some flavor.  Otherwise, the dish was very bland.  It was also a small portion for its $28 price.

For dessert, I got a pistachio cake with gelato.  This had an interesting presentation.  A rather large, oval-shaped bowl with some torn pieces of pistachio cake, a small dip of raspberry sorbet, and some fresh fruit. I finished dinner with a cup of coffee.

Service throughout our almost two hours there was first rate.  Rocco and his staff were excellent.  The room is very nicely done and their was a vibrancy to the place that I liked.

On the other had, I know Giada is a celebrity.  But must everything have her name or her stylized g imprinted on it.  Before I left, I checked in the bathroom to see if I had her name stamped on my ass but it wasn't there.  Being a celebrity also means that you can take normal prices, add the surcharge for dining on the Strip, and then add another surcharge for dining in Giada's establishment.  A double whammy.  

The salad was a good sized portion but the pasta was almost laughable in its size.  Following other restaurants lately, the pasta was served in a huge dish with a relatively small well in the center for the pasta.  

The only thing that rescues Giada (see, I feel I have to use her name throughout the review, too), from a 2 star review would be the salad and the service.  Been there, done that, won't be back.",29,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The price range here is for the most part inexpensive (H&M, Charlotte Russe) to moderate range (Banana Republic, JCrew).  The most high-end retailers you'll probably find here are the Michael Kors outlet and Brooks Brothers.  We browsed a bit through some of the clothing, shoe, and kitchen stores, and found that the outlet prices were slightly cheaper than original price, but not cheap enough to want us to buy the items outright.  I did end up buying a cute tote from the Coach Factory, which was an additional 30% off, although it seems like they always have an additional % off their items whenever I walk into a Coach outlet store.

Food options are very limited here!  There's a pretzel place if you want a snack, a Chinese fast-food place, and a Subway.  

As for the atmosphere, it's nice that there is a huge canopy covering the walkways of this open-air outlet mall.  In the summer, this will really help!

I was ten minutes early and it was ready yet which is good because it wasn't made ahead of time and sitting somewhere.  The online ordering was a big plus!!

I got an original pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac and cheese.  My wife got the Cajun chicken sandwich with a side of garlic mashed.  One of the problems with what I got was simply the fact that it's take out.  I live nearby, but pulled pork isn't boiling hot when it's placed in the bun and therefore it wasn't a hot sandwich and in fact wasn't warm.  Luke warm would be closer to the temperature of the meat.  The mac and cheese stayed warm.  I thought the sandwich was dry even though the menu says it's tossed in their special sauce.  Maybe I should have asked for some BBQ sauce to go.  There was no toss that I could discern.  The mac and cheese was very good.  My wife liked her sandwich although she thought it was very spicy hot.  She liked the garlic mashed side.

I guess I'm just not a BBQ person.  Nothing about BBQ blows my socks off.  If I came back to Lucille's, it would be for a dinner of mac and cheese.

It's been awhile since I've been in New York New York.  I went today to pick up a ticket for Zumanity and I was reminded about the convoluted walk from the garage to the theatre.  I wish I had remembered the two short cuts which would have made my trek more pleasant.  Having said that, it was fun to see the tourist in its grazing area.  In fact, some were just standing there acting like they had a laser sight aimed at them and they were frozen in position.  Get out of my way, you dolt!

I made it to the theatre without too much difficulty but then I waited.  They were understaffed and they also had a customer who needed to make a phone call to find out about a lost reservation booked through her airline.  That kept that agent from helping others for awhile until the agent handed the phone through the bars and let the woman talk directly to the people with whom she had to get the problem resolved.

Ten minutes later, the woman is still on the phone and I make it to the window where she is.  The NY NY rep was a pure delight.  She found the ticket in the system with my confirmation number and she had me on my way in less than two minutes.  And, I took the shortcut back to the garage.

As for the casino and the areas in it, I always liked the vibe of this casino.  The New York theme, the restaurants, the food court--it all goes into making this place OK in my book in spite of the tourists (we have to love them--they pay so much in taxes)!

For my drink, I had asked the clerk about the Malta Polar, a Venezuelan soda, made with molasses instead of sugar.  He said he liked it and I gave it a try.  It was tasty--a bit strong--but it was curiously refreshing.  Wait, that one's taken!  It was very good and it was a good accompaniment for lunch.

When he brought my food, he also brought the three squeeze bottles of sauces.  The red bottle--this is a nice spicy sauce that gave the arepas some kick.  The yellow bottle had a spicy cilantro sauce and this too had a kick.  The white bottle had the mild sauce, but it was OK.  I tried it and then went back to the premium grades.

Coconut and cheese seemed an odd combination to me, but I love coconut, so I had to give this a go.  What a pleasant treat!  The cheese mixed with the coconut had a symbiotic relationship and they went well together.

I sat at the sushi bar a place I like because it's always fun to watch the chefs working their magic and you see a kitchen at work.

I started by ordering three items, Gobo chips (fried burdock root), Iko Geso Age (deep fried squid tentacles), and Enoki with bacon (thin Japanese mushrooms wrapped in bacon and grilled on a skewer.)  

The Gobo chips reminded me of very thin French fries with a bit different texture and a different flavor.  It's the root of the burdock so it has some of the flavor from where it grew.  The seasoning on the Gobo was excellent.

Iko Geso Age, deep fried squid tentacles, were uniformly cooked and seasoned with some salt.  The squid was very flavorful and almost every bite was tender.

Next was the enoki with bacon.  I think most people have seen enoki, either on TV or in the produce section of a market.  Enoki is a very thin stemmed mushroom, white in color, and in this preparation, a number of the mushrooms are gathered together something like a sheaf of wheat and carefully held together by being wrapped by the bacon and placed on a skewer.  It's then grilled.  It is a very tasty dish!

This is what I like about tapas style restaurants, I've eaten three dishes, well actually four, and I still have room to try one more thing.  I asked about their mountain potato on a hot plate.  One of the chefs explained to me that it might not be pleasant to my palate that it was slimy and it had a taste that you either loved or hated at first bite.  He also said the dish was too much for one person in size.  OK, next time I go, I have to go with a group of Yelp friends.  Instead, I ordered a butabara (pork belly)  skewer with salt.  They'll do it unsalted, salted, or with salt on the side.  What tasty pork!  This is reason to return although there' still so much to explore on the menu.

I mention and extra dish but didn't explain it.  When you check in on Yelp, it brings up a screen that gives you a free appetizer.  It was small and had some fish and other items.  It was a good starter and a nice perk for a check in.

Dinner wouldn't be complete without dessert.  I've had my share of chocolate recently, so I went with the green tea waffle dessert.  You get two waffles, vanilla ice cream, and two small containers--one with warm honey and one with melted butter.  I used a bit of the butter and only a small amount of the honey.  The dessert was very good.  And as one person's review stated, it is very filling.

Service was great.  I was there when Kyara opened so there wasn't a crowd there.  I was served twice by one of two servers and I received some of the other dishes over the bar from one of the chefs.  They allowed me to stand and peer over the side of the counter so I could see them making sushi and one of the chefs was trying a new dressing for a salad.  Dinner was very tasty, service was excellent, and I will be back.",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Some items I've found include fresh garbanzo beans, culantro, wild boar, alligator meat and dried avocado leaves. The selection is quite remarkable. 

In addition, the meat and produce sections are very fresh and reasonably priced. The one thing that is still odd is that they have only one food scale for the produce section, and last time I was there it was out of order. How am I supposed to figure out how much my food will weigh and subsequently cost without accurate measuring devices?

Service has always been good and I haven't run into any check out issues or extended waiting times since the grand opening. Before you check out remember that there is a minimum of $5 purchase to use credit or debit though.

I was to the VooDoo Steal restaurant about 10 years ago but hadn't been back since.  Restaurant Week gave me the impetus to go for dinner and to check out the new zip line attraction from the patio.

You have to check in on the second floor of the Rio's Masquerade Tower and then ride the glass elevator up the side of the building to the next to top floor.  The restaurant was almost empty at 5:30 when I arrived.  

I was seated quickly at a window table facing the Bellagio and other south Strip properties across the freeway.  I was soon brought menus--I had to ask for the Restaurant Week menu.  I ordered an iced tea which was soon at the table and I got a nice basket of bread.

For the first course, I got the classic French onion soup.  It was a good rendition of this soup that I haven't gotten in quite some time.

For the main course, I ordered the flat iron steak extra rare.  It was a little too cooked for me but not enough to make me grimace.  The cut by nature is not the most tender steak cut but it has a lot of good flavor.  The red wine reduction added to the good beef flavor.

For dessert, I chose the assorted ice creams.  In this case, there were three dips of ice cream, pistachio, coffee, and vanilla with some fresh berries.

Service was very good.  My empty artificial sweetener packets were removed from the table as soon as a server or busser walked by.  Iced tea was refilled before my glass was empty, and plates were cleared in a timely manner.

After I ordered, my server told me to enjoy the patio and that I should feel free to take my iced tea outside with me.  This gave me a chance to take some photos and to check out that new zip line.  When I went back in, the server said he'd start my order.  This happened on my first visit years ago, and it's a nice touch especially for tourists who want to get photos of themselves with the resort corridor hotels behind them.

This was a good meal but it's not a place I'd regularly visit.  It's nice now and then for the view, but there are better values closer to home.  But we all have to be tourists in this wonderful city and this is a good way to do it!",14,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
OETh78qcgDltvHULowwhJg,0,2012-07-13,0,U15-t1I-E4fyhyuIHTd7ug,4,"Went here on a Saturday night as an anniversary celebration dinner.  The meals we had here were superb.  From the lovely selection of bread, to our delectable appetizers, we started our meals off right.  I had the lobster with chorizo appetizer ($28), and my husband had the Caesar salad ($17).  The lobster was perfectly cooked and tender.  Strangely enough though, the chorizo was very mild and I couldn't really taste any typical chorizo flavor or spicy heat in it.  Maybe it was a more European version of chorizo?  My husband's Caesar salad came with a Scotch quail egg, which was perfectly crispy on the outside, yet light, with lots of flavor.

We had the beef Wellington for two ($100), which took some time to get served to us, but it was worth it!  I savored every bite of the beef, packed with flavor, and the flaky pastry crust with mushroom paste covering the inside.  

I decided to try the HK antioxidant cocktail ($14), which was smooth and refreshing.  The flavors were fruity and perfect together.

While I enjoyed the meal, service was off.  For such a fine establishment where you are paying a lot of money for your meal I really expect nothing but friendliness and attentiveness from the wait staff.  For the most part, this was true.  However, our main server seemed disinterested and wasn't very friendly throughout the whole meal.  When it came to ordering dessert, we were so stuffed we couldn't possibly eat any more, but really wanted to take something back to the hotel with us for later.  We asked for the sticky toffee pudding to go, and initially our server wouldn't let us order it, because the ice cream would melt, he said.  We told him that we were heading right to our hotel room afterwards and the room had a freezer.  After some discussion, he finally said he could pack it up to go, but without the ice cream.  Once again, our room had a freezer, so the ice cream wouldn't melt, but whatever, we were OK with eating it without ice cream.  Eating it later on, perhaps that ice cream would have helped cut the very sweet nature of the dessert, for it was almost cloyingly sweet for my tastes.

P.S.  If you have a Total Rewards casino card with any Harrah's-owned establishment, they give you a few dollars off each item you order, but if you pay with your rewards points, your total is based on the normal non-discount price.",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The stage is a good size, and the sound and lighting for tonight's show was excellent.  This tribute show has been well planned.

Review for the show itself: the guys have good voices and play wonderfully.  They are best when they sing with some harmony.  A few times when one of the guys was singing alone, the sound was not the Beatles but the individual.  When singing in unison, they sounded much closer to the Beatles.

I went with the 16 oz size Moka Moka which is essentially an iced mocha.  It was only a few short minutes for them to make it and we were on our way to shop and sip. It was cool, caffeinated, and refreshing, just what I was looking for. The boba was a good soft yet chewy consistency. Is it the best bubble tea I've had?

First was the tom yum kai soup at medium spiciness.  The soup was good, had a fair amount of chicken, but was missing in straw mushrooms.  Before we had much time to enjoy the soup, two more dishes were brought out.  So much for spacing.

The first was nam kao tod which the menu describes as crispy rice mixed with sour cubed pork sausages, cilantro, green onions, grounded dry chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice.  The crispy rice were very present but cubed pork was almost flavorless.  The dish was really lacking.  Along with this, we were served the nam prik ong, spicy red chili dip served with vegetables and some fried pork rind.  The chili was flavorful and I found putting it on the rinds was the best way to eat it.  Crunchy texture and heat.

We were then brought the khao soi with beef and the thum ka noon with chicken.  Both dishes were OK.  The winning dish was the khao soi.  Very flavorful with outstanding noodles.  This was one of two dishes that were very good.  I thought the thum ka noon was watery and didn't have a lot of flavor.  

The one dish which was the other star of our meal was forgotten.  We had to have our server come back to the table and remind him that we had ordered the garlic prawns.  We were brought our order.  The prawns were good and the crispy outer shells very delightful.

I had a diet Coke which was refilled several times without asking.  Service was good but I wish they had spaced the dishes out more so we had a little more time with each dish.

The ordering is very much like Chipotle style in that you choose your protein, protein carrier (E.g. Salad, bread, fries), mix ins and your sauce. The price for beef, chicken, or vegan kisir is the same which I thought would have been a rip off if I were getting the vegan option since kisir sounded like the Turkish equivalent of tabbouleh, made of relatively inexpensive ingredients. I went with the chicken encased in bread, with shredded carrot, cabbage, sumac onion, and shepherd salad (tomatoes, cucumber, dill). I asked for both the haydari (White) and spicy devil sauce (Red). Since everything is already prepped it took only a short amount of time to toast the bread and assemble my meal. The total was a little less than $10 and I was on my way to enjoy my meal at home.

The bread was soft but tough enough to withstand all the different ingredients in the sandwich. It was like a cross between a pita and shepherd's bread. I liked how it was cut part way so that any filling material would be held in the sandwich instead of falling out when you picked it up. 

The doner itself reminded me a lot of the Turkish version of muffaletta, with thinly shaved meat, and various marinated textural condiments in a round sandwich bread.

The blend of meat and vegetables was delicious and I was pretty full after eating the sandwich.

Table 10 only offers a lunch option during Restaurant Week but this is a good way to try a place.  For the first course, I went with the chicken and Andouille sausage gumbo.  This is Emeril's place so why go with a salad.  The gumbo also had steamed rice in it and my server added freshly ground pepper to my liking.  When I first tasted the gumbo, I thought that it needed something more to kick it up a notch.  I almost asked for some hot sauce but I thought that might be like asking for a salt shaker at Joël Robuchon.  As I ate the gumbo, the spiciness started to kick in.  The spice was there.  It showed itself fully as you ate more of the gumbo.

For the main course, I chose the the pea tortellini.  This menu describes it as sweet pea tortellini with handmade pasta, pea shoots, Romano cheese, mascarpone and lemon oil.  It was really a flavorful dish and just the right amount for lunch considering dessert was yet to come.

For dessert, you can choose any of the desserts on the menu.  I went with the specialty of the house, the banana cream pie.  It was excellent.  A tall slice of goodness with layers of large, whole chucks of banana with seams of cream.  It's like a block wall of banana with cream holding the blocks in place.  It was excellent!

Despite it being so busy, there wasn't any wait to place our order, and there were still seats left for us to enjoy our meal. Even though they were slammed with orders, we still got service with a smile. Our order didn't take too long to get made, and soon we were enjoying our cheap yet tasty burgers.

I decided to go out on a limb and try something completely foreign to me in the realm of burgers- protein style (Substitute wrapped lettuce for bun)! I had it with cheese, and also animal-style. I shared some fries, well-done (i.e., they are fried twice instead of once), and a fountain drink.

The burger with no bun and lettuce wrapping was quite good. the crisp, fresh lettuce was a good complement to the hot grilled burger patty and condiments. Despite it being wrapped in the requisite paper pouch, it was still a messy meal as the lettuce does not soak up any of the grease and sauce like a regular bun will, so as I ate more, the paper got soggy and juices started to run down my hand and arm. While I really enjoyed the burger protein-style, I think a single patty just isn't enough for me, since I was still a bit hungry after chowing down so next time I will try it double-double!

The fries, when ""well-done"", are a whole lot better than their regular style. Frying them twice made them quite crispy, and the extra frying adds more flavor to the potatoes. I do appreciate that they use freshly cut potatoes though!

In a reasonable amount of time my pasta was brought to me.  It was very good but I expected more of an uni taste.  The tomato cream flavor was very good but it overwhelmed the uni.  The uni was in the pasta and also chopped in smaller pieces in the sauce. The mint leaves added a great counter flavor to the tomato.  The blancmange was the highlight of the evening.

There were also some beautiful mushrooms that held the heat from the burner below.  Be on guard to let the mushrooms cool a bit before eating.

A couple of things regarding service.  We were seated and our server was prompt at getting our order.  Since my friend is from Taiwan, she ordered in Chinese and I'm sure that helped our service.  

At the end of the meal, they brought us a complimentary warm mung bean dessert that was very tasty--not too sweet.  Our server also packaged up all the leftovers in take out boxes and I have enough in my refrigerator to feed half the Taiwanese army.  It will taste good as leftovers.

I chose the chicken caprese sandwich, which came with your choice of salad or chips (Caesar salad for me). The bread with the sandwich was superb. The outer crispy crust contrasted well with the moist, soft texture of the bread. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the basil/mozzarella combination was excellent. The salad was crisp and refreshing. It was quite a lot of food for $5!

Service was good despite the large number of patrons. Drinks were refilled as needed and the owner and staff were very friendly.

The veggie salad was a fairly large portion, with an even amount of vinaigrette dressing and toppings. The S.O.P. pizza had a nice balance of meaty sausage, creamy ricotta, sweet roasted peppers, and caramelized onions with tomato sauce. The pizza crust was cooked better than at the other location, with no char around the edges and a lighter tasting dough.

We made reservations and arrived just as they were opening.  We were seated promptly and told that Bobby would be our server.  Within a short time, Bobby appeared at the table to ask about drinks.  We ordered two iced teas that were promptly brought. We were also brought a a bread basket with some lavash and warm rolls.  

I had looked at the menu online so there was no wait in giving Bobby our order.  For a started, we got the asparagus fries.  There were five spears with just a small amount of breading and deep fried.  They were quite good.  The tarragon in  ketchup gave it a good flavor.  I'm not a ketchup fan but I dipped some of my asparagus pieces in their ketchup.

The meal comes with soup or salad.   We both opted for the soup du jour which was potato cheese and it was superb!  It is a smooth potato soup, not chunky, and the flavors were there.

I got the 10 ounce filet cooked blue just as I asked and my wife got the roasted chicken breast.  The steak had been rolled in cracked pepper before grilling and there was some freshly ground salt on top.  The combination along with the fact that the steak was very tender made this a winner.   The steak came with choice of mashed or baked potato.  I chose the baked and got a nice size potato with extra butter and cream cheese.My wife was a bit disappointed with her chicken which was dry from being baked too long.  Her dinner came with some seasonal vegetables.

For dessert, we shared a peach cobbler with a small container of crème Anglaise.  The cobbler was good and more than enough for two.

Our server, Bobby, was a gem.  It seemed like he must have been there for a long time but I didn't ask.  He checked on us often, he stopped by to ask if we had talked about the peach cobbler because he wanted to let us know that it takes about 20 minutes to bake.  This is exactly what a good server does.  He helps, checks on you, but doesn't hover.

I shared the California Wrap with Shirley.  It was quite good.  Ray had a burger with bleu cheese and bacon, two shared a Cobb Salad, and two shared a Southwest Chicken Sandwich.

A rock show featuring music from classic rock bands of the 80s?  Who would have thought that I would leave completely loving the show!

Rock of Ages is a jukebox musical with the usual thin story line--enough of a story to string a number of songs together so it makes some sense with the story.  The show is high energy, foot tapping, sometimes hand clapping and hand waving.  It's the kind of show that puts a smile on your face early on and you keep it for the rest of the show.

I was surprised when I knew more of the songs than I thought I would--""We're Not Gonna Take It"" - ""Waiting For a Girl Like You"" - ""Harden My Heart"" - ""Here I Go Again"" - ""Any Way You Want It"" - ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" to name a few.

The show is quite funny at times and the narrator, Lonny, has some great scenes and some very funny off hand comments.  The dancing is wonderful and the real band working in the back almost out of sight is excellent!

There is a 7 minute intermission about an hour into the show.  This is described as a quick bathroom break and there's a large clock displayed on a screen at the back of the stage.  The clock is the Whizz Meter 5000 and it counts down from 7 minutes.  There actually was more like 9 minutes so if you run, you may be able to make it back in time.  I stood at my seat to stretch and take some photos.  The show is just about two hours long including intermission and it started almost on time.

I really can't articulate any better how surprised I was with this show and how much I liked it.  I will be going to see it again, and maybe again another time.  It's not Phantom, but it's damn good!

I was here years and years ago after it first opened.  It was a breakfast stop on our bike ride.  I hadn't been back since, but I'm glad I came back.

It was Happy Hour and our server, Alyssa, told us that all the apps were $8.  Since we were having dinner, we passed on that.  I have driven by often and seen their sign of steak and lobster for $19 available 24/7.  I asked if with the Groupon I could still get the special.  The answer was yes.  My wife ordered the Mushroom risotto.  We didn't order sides because we were both going to get dessert.

Alyssa brought the food in a short time and she came back to see if my steak was rare enough.   It wasn't, but not by much and not enough to make a fuss over.  She understood as she likes her beef cooked blue also.  My steak was served on a thick slice of white potato and some fried onions.  My wife's mushroom risotto had several stalks of asparagus on top.  Both dishes were excellent!

On to dessert.  Andrea chose the Chocolate royale and I got the lemon pudding cake.  Both were very good.  

I'd most likely give Sedona a 3 star rating but Alyssa was such a good server, I've upped the rating to 4 stars.  The place is a bit pricey but I can't complain about the cost of my special.  The two desserts were more expensive than my steak and lobster.

Linguini with zucchini flowers
Linguini vongole
Spaghetti carbonara
Gnocchi
Pappardelle Bolognese
Baked rigatoni

The Signature pasta, done table side with flaming vodka in a wheel of parmigiano reggiano to melt some of the cheese and then having the vodka sauced pasta finished in the melted cheese wheel with some fresh basil leaves pulled off a plant and mixed in the pasta.  The flavors are very good and it's one of those fun dishes to watch being created at your table.

The lasagna is a must try dish.  It's layered spinach pasta filled with tomato béchamel sauce and bolognese gravy.  The béchamel-cheese in the layers is creamy goodness.

The gnocchi, pappardelle Bolognese, and spaghetti carbonara are good choices.

Dishes to avoid:  Zucchini flowers, baked rigatoni, spaghetti and meatballs, and the arancini.

This was opening night but the room was a veritable zoo that night.  The service was all over the place.  Our server was very good but his bussers just weren't up to the job.  There were times that there were main dishes to serve and there were no share plates for the table.  Our server tried to rectify this only to have some of the workers ignore the problem at hand.  You can;'t chalk this up to opening night jitters.  There had been a couple of soft opening nights prior to this one when many of these issues should have been addressed and solved.

I'll be back, but they need time to sort out what's right and wrong with the service and to make some corrections to the food, specifically the meatballs and some other items.

I ordered the Curry chicken wrap and my friend got their multigrain pancakes with both bananas and chocolate chips.  The wrap is a chicken curry salad with romaine lettuce, cucumbers, and mayo in a whole wheat tortilla.  You have a choice of mixed green salad, French fries, sweet potato fried or onion rings as a side.  I, of course, took the healthy route and got the French fries.

The wrap was very good.  I also got some iced tea.  It's a serve yourself counter on the side.  They had regular and passion fruit.  The passion fruit tea was very tasty.

My friends pancakes were quite good he reported.  The pancakes came with a side of fresh fruit.  After a graveyard shift at a local hospital and a tough hike, the pancakes were enough to carb up his diet to keep going.

The exhibits themselves tend to be either fenced or wooden posts for barriers. The wooden post barriers are nice in that you get a very close view of the animals.  There are a wide variety of animals from different parts of the world.  There also had some animals that were genetically unusual, such as the white alligator, albino python, and white tiger.  The baby animal nursery was great and we got a close up view of those adorable babies (Porcupines and black jaguar when we were here).  One of my favorite exhibits was the penguin exhibit, and we stuck around for the penguin feeding.  They had a group of only one type of penguin here (The black footed penguin), but hey, for Arizona, it's great that they have penguins here at all!

While the zoo closes at 6, the aquarium is still open until 9 P.M.  We spent the day at the zoo, had dinner at Dillon's, then spent the rest of our time here at the aquarium, which made for a very nice, pleasant day.  The aquarium has 3 different buildings you can go to.  There's two different ""touch"" pools, one for starfish/horseshoe crab, and another with various rays.  There were some unusual aquarium setups, such as an aquarium on the ceiling which I thought was cool because you can see the bellies of the fish and the rays when you look up.  I was surprised to see they had a (Ridley?) sea turtle, very cool.  I also thought it was cool that they had a nautilus exhibit, a very unusual and beautiful animal.

If you buy Hickman's eggs, there is often a coupon for 2 for 1 on the inside package, which is how we got our discount.  I have also seen them on Groupon.  If you are in West part of the valley, this is an excellent way to spend your day.  

P.S.  Please don't come here in the evening expecting to see Zoo Lights, and then complain to the poor cashier about how they are open until 9 P.M. but don't have any animals on exhibit!  I felt bad for the cashier who patiently explained to the irate customer how the animals are naturally sleeping at night, that they are not the Phoenix Zoo, but they do have aquarium exhibits to see until 9.

The menu is simple, which allows them to excel at what they do best- carne asada and pollo asado. I got a half chicken meal to go with rice and beans ($8.08). While I waited for my meal I took a seat and admired the spotlessly clean surroundings and small fridge with various bottled sodas. There is also a soda fountain behind the counter. 

My meal was packaged in a few minutes and I was quickly out the door. The chicken was a hearty size, and I probably only ate about 1/2 portion of my meal for lunch. The sides and salsa were a generous portion in to go cups. The flavors of everything were great. Excellently seasoned, and well balanced. Everything went well with each other. In addition to the chicken, salsa, and sides, a generous portion of warm corn tortillas, pickled onions, a slice of lime, and roasted jalapeño was included.

I was also expecting some kind of bread stuffing, but it was a stuffing of small tomato cubes and some other vegetables.  One of my friends asked me the next day what the stuffing was.  He had it , too, and had no idea.  The vegetables with it were overcooked and therefore mushy.  The potatoes were OK.

A major plus was the staff.  The servers were very polite and efficient.  One negative was that someone left one of the doors to the outside open and it let in a lot of cold air.  Finally, someone shut it.

I had a chicken tikka masala panini ($6) with a Caesar side salad ($1.80). I got the order to go, and it didn't take too long to be made. I was out the door in no time.

The sandwich had a crisp outer grilled crust, with fluffy, light tasting bread. There were big chunks of chicken breast in it, and the sauce was like the memory of chicken tikka masala sauce, a milder version rather than the bold spicy tomato-y cream sauce I'm typically used to. The salad was refreshing and crisp, and the dressing was flavorful.

Wok charred edamame
Ancient grain Greek
Blood orange and root
Bacon jam with toasted baguette
Wild mushroom flatbread
Pear and bleu flatbread
Hawaiian sliders
Secret Sunday chicken sandwich
Sprouts and spuds
Steelhead trout
Turducken pot pie
Shepard's 3.14
Banoffee Pie

This was my third visit to Carson Kitchen and I was wowed by the creativity--the risk taking by the chefs with these dishes.  Some standouts for me:  since I hadn't had the bacon jam when it was on the menu before, this was a treat.  As a person who has only eaten Spam for the first time within the last year, I was pleasantly surprised by the Hawaiian slider with a round of Spam on the bottom, a ring of pineapple on top, and the whole thing topped with some seaweed slaw.  The Secret Sunday chicken sandwich is very large so this is definitely a share dish, too.  The chicken was as moist as could be and the and the spicy aioli topped it off nicely.

The last three savories all were amazing.  The Turducken pot pie with buttermilk crumble top was nice and creamy and the duck flavor came through the well crafted cream to the pot pie.  The Shepard's Pie 3.14 is a new take on the traditional pie.  Cubes of lamb, gnocchi, vegetables, and potato sticks.  Very creative and tasty with the rich broth.

I was completely blown away by the steelhead trout.  Although hard to say, this was the best savory of the day for me.  Cooked perfectly, the trout was moist and rich.  

Finally, the Banoffee Pie with Bailey's whipped cream and biscotti, was a perfect way to end this lunch.  I'd had this before and was glad to see it come back to the menu.

Service was superb!  New share plates were always brought, the staff was extremely friendly, and Chef Harwell was there to introduce each of the dishes and expolain how and/or why it came about.

This is a gem of a dining spot not just for Downtown Las Vegas but from any place in the Valley.  Carson Kitchen rocks!",15,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I was able to sit in the coveted ""private dining room"" which in fact for me was the patio area.  I was the only one who wanted to sit out on a very pleasant night when the wind had stopped and the temperature was pleasant.

Service started quickly and remained top notch throughout the entire evening.  I ordered an iced tea and it was brought with a small shaker bottle of simple syrup.

My order included French onion soup for the appetizer, the 9 ounce Wagyu skirt steak with foie gras addition for the main course accompanied by their Mac & Cheese waffle.  For dessert, I ordered the crème brûlée doughnuts.

It seemed like a long wait for the onion soup but I was enjoying the beautiful evening and the people watching the patio afforded.  I could hear the music from inside and the patio proved the golden place to sit this night.

The onion soup was brought and it was well worth the wait.  The rich broth with sliced onions and topped with gruyère and parmesan cheeses was very good.  Shortly after the soup was brought, a server asked if I wanted some bread.  I asked for some but asked for a small amount--not a full portion.  I was brought two end pieces of wonderful bread with butter that was topped with some black salt crystals.  It was excellent.  The butter had softened from the warm bread and spread beautifully.

I had asked for my steak to be as rare as possible, a difficult request for skirt steak because of the lack of thickness to this cut.  It was done perfectly.  It was accompanied by a glazed shallot and some chimichurri sauce in a small gravy boat type container.  On the side were three pieces of the mac & cheese waffle and the one server urged me to eat the waffle while it was hot.

This cut of steak is known for its flavor and it was very good.  It was tender and moist.  The foie gras was outstanding.  That was the first thing I ate, and I savored every piece.  The mac and cheese waffles were served with the same type of small gravy boat but with a cheese sauce.  Altogether, the waffles, the foie gras, and the steak made for an outstanding main course.  

Room for dessert--of course.  Well, I did leave one waffle, but the server had been correct about eating these while hot.  It lost a little something as the waffle cooled somewhat.  My server told me about a special sorbet for that evening but I had to go with the crème brûlée doughnuts.  It was the right choice to make.  These are doughnut holes filled with vanilla custard and they are so good.  None of the three was left.

Service throughout the night was excellent.  My main server, Keith, accompanied by his co-server Lewis, made sure that my iced tea glass was always filled.  It seemed like several of the servers from inside, when they stepped out for a quick breath of fresh air, stopped by to check on me.  

Two hours later, I left having enjoyed the private dining room and filled with good food.  Prices are on the high side--Downtown Summerlin pricing--but I knew this going in so there's no complaint about that.  It was a very good dinner with excellent service in very enjoyable surroundings.",19,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I decided to upgrade my mani/pedi with additional exfoliation and callus removal, and the nails on my hands and feet looked great.

We came here for an early dinner and ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and the Hainanese chicken rice. Both came out in a few minutes. The Hainanese chicken rice had tender chicken (Thigh and leg) and came with three sauces. In general it was OK but I wasn't particularly wowed by it. I would have liked some more oomph in the flavor of the ginger garlic sauce. The vegetables in the meal, while tender and well cooked, were also not thoroughly washed as I got bits of grit when I chewed on them. This dish is so simple, relying on a fine balance of delicately flavored chicken and rice with bolder sauces that everything rests in the technique to make it an outstanding meal. If an element is off it really affects the whole composition of the dish as a result. 

The Taiwanese beef noodle soup had a spicy kick to it and was filled with thick noodles and tender beef. The flavor was more bold than the chicken. Overall it was decent but I've had richer broths at other restaurants for this dish.

I also had a Hong Kong style milk tea. It was served in a Mason jar and was lightly sweet and refreshing.

Service was good and we were checked on as needed.

I had never been to the Fashion Show Mall location so this was a new restaurant for me.  I received a coupon in the mail and decided to use it.

I was seated at a booth.  They have no two top tables so I opted for the four person booth.  It was early so I wasn't taking room away from people waiting.  Very quickly, my server, Drew, came by, introduced himself and asked about beverages.  After asking for iced tea, he brought me two glasses just in case I needed a refill and he wasn't readily available.

I was then brought some bread and he poured some olive oil onto a serving plate but I stopped before he added any balsamic because I'm not a fan of oil and balsamic with bread.  Instead, I added a little salt and the oil was ready for the bread.

The veal marsala was brought and it was a good sized portion of the hearty dish.  The sauce was a little strong but not overpowering.  Drew checked back a few times to see how things were going and I took my time to enjoy the veal.  The weak part of the meal was the spaghetti.  There's a balance between too much and too little olive oil for pasta and this failed on the too little side.  There was some oil in the bottom of the bowl and I mixed it around and tried to coat some of the spaghetti the best I could.  I was almost ready to pour some extra on the pasta from the cruet on the table but I opted not to.

After clearing the dishes, I was asked about dessert and Drew brought the menu.  One thing caught my eye--the chocolate zuccotto cake that I had seen in so many of the Yelp photos.  When I ordered that, Drew cautioned me that it was a LARGE piece of cake.  That was OK.  He said, ""We have take out boxes,"" and walked away with a small laugh.  When he came with the cake, I knew why he took the effort to point out the size.  It was large and it's one of the best values for dessert where restaurants tend to charge high prices for small desserts.  It's chocolate cake layered with sambuca mousse.  It was excellent and although it was a bit much, I did not need a take home box.

Service was good, the room is appealing, but it will not be a place to which I return with any regularity.  I noticed the take one home offer and I noticed the large number of people who got the less expensive pasta dishes and had another brought to them in a small shopping bag to take home for the next day's dinner.  This isn't of interest to me but it certainly is for many.  

Maggiano's is OK but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.  I don't have to because it's a mile from home, but that won't make me return quickly.",18,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I have often read about how good this place is and I wanted to try it.  What better way than Restaurant Week.  

The bread basket had a very tasty piece of lavash, a seeded roll of some kind, a pretzel roll,  and two slices of raisin bread.  The raisin bread was also good and the basket came with the bread warmed.

Course 1:  I chose the black bean soup which was served with a small dish of chopped red onion and a tiny pitcher of sherry.  The onion added to the somewhat bland soup.  Since I don't do alcohol, I guess the sherry would kick it up a notch.  I depended on some salt.  It was a good starter.

Course 2:  I had to do the Filet Oscar and I wasn't disappointed.  It's a 12 ounce monster so go hungry!  I asked for it cooked black and blue and it was--nicely charred on the outside and blue from shivering on the inside.  These steak chefs know how to cook a steak the right way.  If you look at my photos, you can see the flaming grill.  My steak was in the middle of the flame for a short while.  The cook took some beef skin from a rib roast a put it on the grill.  When the fat dripping onto the mesquite flared up, he placed my steak in the middle.  With the steak came some nice king crab meat, two asparagus spears, and some excellent Bernaise.  I opted for the bake potato and the vegetable for the evening was baby carrots.  Before the entrée was brought, a server had delivered to the table a plate with 4 small dishes with chives, butter, sour cream, and bacon bits.  You could load up your baked potato, or not, any way you wanted.  I like the do it yourself style.

Course 3:  For dessert, they bring the dessert cart to your table.  There was a chocolate mousse cake, their take on Bananas Foster with the ingredients in a martini glass, cheesecake, some others I can't remember and the raspberry chocolate cake I ordered.  It was great!

My server was Mitch and he was an attentive and pleasant fellow.  I would have given this 5 stars but for a few things that caused my downgrade.  There was some crab shell in my king crab.  The carrots were very crisp--undone crisp--and were only lukewarm.  I was there at 5 when they opened so they weren't done enough yet.  Later as I watched the chefs place carrots on dishes, I could see the steam coming from them.  Finally, I had a long wait for an iced tea refill the first time I requested it.  Otherwise, service was good.

Note:  They do not take the M-Life card if you're using the purchase for tier credits.  For some reason (well we know why), Circus Circus is the poor stepchild of the MGM Resorts.  Your check will say use your M-Life card, but you can't.

I had the ackee and saltfish strudel and had the curry conch as a main dish. The strudel top layer was crispy, but the successive layers were gummy tasting. The saltfish and ackee itself tasted good though. The ackee had the typical creamy, egg-like taste juxtaposed against the concentrated flavor of the cod. As for the main dish, I liked the tropical flavor of the curry and it was a generous portion of curry, cabbage, and red beans with rice. However, the conch was overcooked and had a very rubbery tough texture. 

Other dishes I tried were a lot better, such as the jerk chicken and meat patty. 

Service was good and drinks were refilled as needed. They have an interesting selection of Caribbean sodas including Ting, which is similar to the taste of Squirt.

For starters, I had their marinated jelly fish with sesame oil, chilis, and some thinly sliced pickled vegetables.  The sauce made with the oil and chilis gave the jelly fish a very good taste.  This was the first time I had jelly fish and I found it good.  Chewy and not too flavorful in itself.  It needs a good dressing, like pasta, to give it some flavor.

For dessert, I ordered the pumpkin in coconut milk.  It was fresh pumpkin cubes in sweetened and warmed coconut milk.  Very good!

Service was excellent.  When I asked the server about the size of a cup of soup, he told me it's generally too big for one person--people often split it--and I opted to skip having soup.  It was early and the restaurant was quiet, but everyone who works there was cheerful, greeted me, and had a big smile.

Thanks for the tips, Misti, Mamie, Holly, and Paolo!

I have to go back and try some more.  It is good!",11,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The theatre was clean and comfortable.  This was a 7 PM screening and since it seems that many Las Vegans are out of town on end of summer vacations, there was no wait at the ticket booth.

The restaurant is divided into three sections and there's a bar area with eating/drinking overlooking the casino.   Four of us met for dinner and ordered a number of small plates, greens, and main courses.  We shared all items ordered and here's the list:

Egg and pork belly
Short ribs
Brie and cranberry jam
Cowboy caviar
Shrimp and grits
Mushrooms and burrata
Strawberry, champagne, walnut, and goat cheese salad
Spinach, bacon, mushroom, and sweetbread salad
Jalapeño-chorizo corn off the cob
Pork butt with whiskey apples and bacon emulsion
Duck with white bean, confit, and fig
Brussels sprouts and walnuts
Mahi ""baja"" with drunken cherries and smokey almonds
Apple crostata
Ermahgerd sundae
S'mores
Pumpkin cake

While waiting for all four to arrive, two of us were given a container of cheddar puffs and more were brought when we were all seated.  We discussed what each found interesting on the menu.  The head chef joined us and explained the entire menu and he gave us some suggestions.

The outstanding items were the egg and pork belly, cowboy caviar, the strawberry salad, pork butt, Brussels spouts, egg and pork belly, and the mahi.  Of those items, the mahi was the best thing of the night.  The char and the perfect grilling of the mahi made it an incredible dish.  The cowboy caviar, a.k.a. bull testicle, was tender and had a light breading before frying.  

The pork belly was quite thick but was tender and cooked well.  I was surprised at how much I liked the strawberry frisée salad.  The champagne dressing with the walnuts and goat cheese was very refreshing and tasty!    The pork butt was done nicely so that it was pull apart goodness.  There was a discussion about the Brussels sprouts.  I was very fond of this dish and I found the crisp char on the sprouts to be just to my liking.

My only disappointment was the brie with cranberry jam.  The brie had lost all flavor and it really needed the jam to give the dish some taste.  I'd skip this one.

As for dessert, we agreed the S'mores topped the others.  The menu describes the dessert as Graham + salted caramel ganache + honey chocolate mousse + marshmallow + chocolate ice cream + cookie crumble.  The Ermahgerd sundae was also good.  It's described as Peanut butter gelato + peanut coffee ""rocks"" + caramel+brownies + brûléed banana.  The pumpkin cake and the apple crostata were also very good.  I think I could go back and have all five of the desserts but skip the 6th--cookies and milk--and I'd have had a memorable time!  Great ending to our feast!

Service was excellent.  Jeremy--our main server--came from the original Searsucker in San Diego and he was top notch in everything.  We were given clean share plates and utensils for each course.  Jeremy coursed our selections perfectly so we didn't get a whole lot at any one time.  Water was replenished often.

For a new place, they are really doing things well.  Plating was nicely done, the flavors are complex, and the textures are good.

The case was fairly barren but it was 5 PM on a Sunday afternoon and they close at 6 so much of their gelato had been sold.

The shop is fairly small with maybe four tables if you're eating in.  I'm guessing that a lot of pastries are boxed and taken home.  

I ordered a 6 ounce cup of ube gelato.  It was very creamy and had a good flavor.  It was just the perfect ending to what dinner that started at another place.

I did take the opportunity to check out the pastry case and the lava cakes looked quite tempting.  Having a 6 ounce cup of gelato was enough.  Besides, it will give me a reason to stop in again sometime to try the pastries.

For starters, we ordered two quesoin fundidos, one with mushrooms and the other with chorizo.  We also got an ordered of garlic lime fried chapulines (grasshoppers).  With the quesos, we were brought both corn and flour tortillas.  

For the main part of lunch, we got their Grande feast plate which the menu says serves 10-12.  The grande feast consists of two feast plates--the pequeño which serves 3-4 people and the mediano which serves 6-8 people.  The pequeño consists of steak, carnitas & chicken burritos, pulled chicken or cheese quesadillas and beef & chicken taquitos.  The mediano platter consists of Sliced carne asada, grilled chicken, grilled shrimp & chorizo with queso fresco, cactus, grilled onions & chiles.  

There was more than enough for these hungry eaters.  carne asada, grilled chicken, and grilled shrimp of the mediano were very well cooked and seasoned quite well.  I had some of a chicken burrito from the pequeño platter and it was well prepared.  The chapulines were good put a bit pricey at $12.  

For dessert, we got three complimentary flans (one for each Yelp check in) and we got one order of tres leches cake.  The flan was standard.  I really enjoyed the tres leches cake.  Too bad we had to share!

While we were eating, the General Manager, Christian Umlauf, visited our table and talked with us about the restaurant and was very genial and a gracious host.  Shortly after, Chef Paco, the executive chef, came to the table and brought a bag of spicy nuts that his mother sends him from Mexico City.  He shared a good part of the bag with us in a styrofoam cup.  A very pleasant man who explained some of the dishes.

Jesse was our server and he did an outstanding job!  He kept water glasses filled, brought more tortillas as needed, and was always available when we had a equation.

We were looking at the lists of shows for Saturday night, and were approached by 3 different staff members at different times while we were deciding, who were all very friendly, but recommended the same show.  When we decided on a different show, they all asked us ""Are you sure you don't want to see the other show?"".  When we went to the counter and told the clerk the show we were going to see, he also mentioned the other show and tried to recommend it to us.  

Now, the first time I was approached and got the recommendation for the other show, I thought, OK, I'll look at the brochure and decide.

When we walked in, the room smelled strongly of bleach, which is fine since I'd rather have it smell more antiseptic than smelling like no one had done anything to the room. The room itself was spacious and the bed was comfortable. The hard wooden bedframes have sharp corners that are right at the shin/knee level which can cause some painful bruises if you are not careful of where you walk! 

The bathroom was also spacious, with a shower, no tub. The shower itself has good water pressure, but the floor in our shower made a strange creaking noise whenever I moved.

We stayed for one night over the weekend and found the hotel to be quiet. We couldn't hear any of the other patrons which was nice (Although this might have been due to the fact that there weren't many patrons here in the hotel in general).

Breakfast was decent. It included beverage such as apple and orange juice, milk, coffee, and tea. There were bagels, slices of bread, mini-muffins, fruity breakfast bars, bananas, and cereals. Food was refreshed fairly quickly once items ran out, and there was no problem finding a place to sit and eat.

Check-in and check-out was easy. Be aware that there is about a $9 facility fee which covers breakfast, wi-fi, exercise room, etc.

In general, while you're getting a deal by staying off the Strip, the hotel is a nondescript brown building with not a lot of good signage yet. The location is a bit less than ideal since it's bordering a more run-down part of town. There is a nice underground garage though.

One thing to note is that there isn't any fridge or microwave in the rooms, so plan accordingly.",0,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Coffee and a breakfast burrito, not a bad combo no? At least that's what I thought as I high tailed it to Solo Cafe. 

The interior is super funky and definitely what you'd call eclectic. There were 3 people that still needed orders made and the barista was the only person at the counter so it did take some time to order but that allowed me to browse through the menu. Since it was such a gross and muggy day I went with the most refreshing caffeinated beverage I could get, the spiced iced toddy. I asked for almond milk in the toddy and the barista filled it to about an inch or two from the top and gave me the carton so I could pour as much as I wanted. Thanks! I also liked that there were Monin bottles with pumps on the counter with honey, regular sweetener, and sugar free sweetener available for your drink free range. That's a nice touch!

The drink itself was perfect for summer. If you like a stronger brew this isn't your drink since it had a light coffee flavor/it was a light brew. The taste of the coffee was perfectly balanced with the spices in it (Clove, allspice, and I think cinnamon?). I did two pumps of sugar free sweetener for my 16 oz drink which was just the right amount for me. 

They have an awards system but you have to input your cell number and then download an app (I had never heard of it before, not 5 Stars) to start using it. Personally I don't like downloading more apps than I need, especially ones where I will only use it for one business. 

Other drinks on the menu looked intriguing too so I'll be back to try more!

They are not sure if the Sterling Brunch will be continued.  Things seem to be in limbo right now.  About a month ago, I made a reservation on Open Table when I learned of the uncertain future.

I arrived a bit early but there was no problem.  I was seated quickly after the hostess checked by Total Rewards card.  There is a small reduction in price with the TR card.  She handed me off to a maître d' who escorted me to my table.  There I was introduced to my server, John, with whom I shared some laughs and comments and from whom I received superb service.

I wasn't there for the unlimited champagne which John was about to pour when I stopped him.  Instead, I asked him for some tomato juice.  He was back in a flash with a good sized glass of tomato juice.  I then made my first trip into the side room where the brunch is set up in chafing dishes on tables.  I found the one with the lobsters and got one.  I added to this a nice petit filet mignon and a lamb chop cut from a rack of lamb that was nicely rare.  The lobster tails (all four of them) were very good and quite good considering they had been grilled and were sitting in a chafing dish.  I was surprised by how tasty the filet was and how medium rare it was again given that it had been broiled and was in a chafing dish.

The second foray was for two more lobster tails and some caviar.  Now you know why I came to the Sterling Brunch.  It was the lobster but there was a good selection of brunch items besides the lobster.

My third trip was for another lobster tail.  I also got some jumbo peeled shrimp, a small amount of lox, and a half yellow tomato stuffed with crab salad.  My last two trips were for dessert to round out the experience.  The last dessert was a made to order fresh fruit crèpe with whipped cream, some more fruit and some chocolate sauce.

A few things about the buffet.  The butter for the lobster and crab is melted and kept in a teapot like container.  As needed, the worker fills the small jars with butter.  The butter should be a lot warmer than it is.  It should be stored in a heated compartment and we could get our own.  It's nice to pick up a glass and go but when it's below standard, that's not the best answer.

There was so much more that I could have tried.  I skipped all the sashimi, the salads for the most part, and some the breakfast foods.  After eating four lobster tails, there wouldn't be a lot of room for those frills.

One thing that marked the brunch was the outstanding service and attitude of the servers and bussers.  Everyone was efficient, polite, had a nice smile, and were very friendly.  If you got a made to order omelette, you didn't wait.  You got your other things and it's brought to your table.  That's just how they do things.

The steakhouse is a classic Las Vegas one.  Lots of wood, booths, and a couple of small tables like the one I was at.  I noted the amount of champagne that was being poured and I heard John tell another customer that they averaged over a bottle per person.  He also would go to the kitchen and bring some special requests to tables.  That's just how the service was.

I  think I'll do this again if it continues and I'll have some of the other foods and cut back on the lobster.  After all, I had no oysters either.  I must be slipping!",6,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

It didn't seem to go together, but I get it now.  They have more than just Argentinian food but that's the highlight.  It's the corner storefront of this U shaped shopping plaza in Chinatown, hence the name.

I came here with a friend for a late morning lunch and we ordered and shared many items from the menu.  We were brought some bread and chimichurri.  The spices in the chimichurri were very good and went well on the bread and some meat we had later on.

We started with an order of provoletta--grilled provolone cheese topped with chili and the chimichurri spices.  We took our knives and dug in and pulled up some cheese that hung like melted cheese will.  I put the cheese on my bread.  Vary tasty and great start.  We then got the order of three empanadas--one ham and cheese, one chicken, and one corn and cheese.  All three were good.  I liked the chicken the most.  The crust was flaky and thin.  The amount of filling for the three was perfect.

Then came the main course--a Parrillada Argentina, a mixture of grilled meat.  Ours consisted of three sausages, sweet bread, skirt steak, and short ribs.  It was perfect for sharing.  We each had a length of short rib, one white sausage each, we shared the one black sausage (blood sausage or blood pudding are two names for it) and we each had a skirt steak.  We got all the meat cooked medium.  The skirt steak was a little tough but it was tasty.  The chimichurri added to the meat.  The grilled meats were really very good.  My favorite here was the blood sausage.  It's the first time I've had it and it was quite good.

Then we ordered four desserts to share--dulce de leche flan, an alfajor, a Mil Hojas, and a pasta frola.  While all four were excellent, I had two favorites here--the mil hojas and the alfajor.  I'd had an alfajor once before and it was good to have this sweet cookie once again and the mil hojas had a great filling of chocolate and the spice, which we couldn't quite place was cardamon our server told us.  The flan was very soft and the pasta frola--quince tart--was also quite good.  

Service was great!  Our server was a delightful young woman who answered questions and always had a pleasant smile.  She refilled our water glasses several times.

The place is no longer on life support and it shows many signs of life and the future looks brighter from the past years when a few restaurants and shops opened and quickly closed for lack of business.

Telemundo coming and renting a good portion of the area for its studios was a boost.  The new Denny's is certainly a boost.  There is a new bar, Drink and Drag, that garners good reviews from the Yelp crew.  Finally, the new zip line ride is being constructed right in the middle of the place.  All these things point to renewed hope for the concept which never really made a go until now.

This morning, I had breakfast at the new Denny's.  I parked in the underground garage which is very, very handy!  One flight of stairs to walk up and I was there.  I was surprised when I got to the booth that there was no charge for the parking.  Their website says free parking with validation but Denny's doesn't validate.  Perhaps it was because I was less than an hour and it was a weekday morning.  Whatever the case, it was a nice bonus.  We are so spoiled by the free parking common in Las Vegas.

The place is very small and we had to wait about 10 minutes before they put two tables together so the 5 of us could sit.

I think I may have simply ordered wrong.  I got # 71, BBQ pork chow fun (dry style).  It was good but there was nothing with the BBQ pork that stood out.

This place differs from other poke places in that they offer sushi burritos/sushi wraps. Protein selections are a little less diverse than at other places but the fish is fresh. 

I had a sushi wrap with marinated tuna, salmon, and a plethora of toppings including diced mango, watermelon radish and masago. The marinated tuna is marinated in their ponzu sauce, and the yuzu dressing that they use is more on the tart side than super sweet which I liked. Also note that they will not make your wrap with brown rice. I think it's probably because the brown rice won't stick to the seaweed wrap like white rice does.

I loved the sushi wrap. It was hearty, filling, and I loved the mix of flavors and textures. The rice was soft and fluffy and it was a good amount of food for lunch. While the fish was fresh it did have a bit of a sticky texture to me. 

They don't have a soda fountain but they do have a varied selection of drinks including cold pressed watermelon juice, Hawaiian soda made with coffee extract, Press cold brew coffee and freshly brewed iced tea.

It's also a good choice for vegetarians, as there are many items on the menu that, while lacking meat, are so flavorful that you don't really need the meat in it.  I've had the hummus and the edamame dumplings, and both have been quite good.  I've also tried the banh-mi wrap and the TLT, and although both are very tasty, I liked the TLT a little more (perhaps due to the smoky bacon-like taste of the tempeh).  Drinks, while expensive, are freshly made, and the Red moon I tried was delicious.  

The sides I had with the sandwich were just OK.  The sweet potato hash was overcooked so there were a lot of burnt bits on my plate, and the kale salad tasted too sour to me.

The basic outline--a group of female impersonators travels from Sydney, Australia to Alice Springs in the center of the country.  Along the way, they have various incidents--some funny, some not funny at all!  The story is not deep.  It's just what it needs to be the move the show along.

This is a national tour show of Priscilla which was to be at the Venetian until the middle of September, but sadly, ticket sales have not been good and the show is ending July 22nd.

So, if you want to see it, you'll have to go quickly.

The show is just about 2 hours in length, and it's goes by quickly.  You'll be amazed when you look at your watch after the show.  The cast is excellent and the staging is very well done.  And of course, the costumes are over the top.  You'll smile and laugh almost the entire show!

We came here and got the express lunch special. They have 3 different options, and we chose the pizza and soup/salad option for $9.95. I had the minestrone soup and the roasted mushroom pizza. The soup was hearty and full flavored, with chunks of spicy sausage, veggies, and pasta. One slight negative was that the pasta was overcooked/mushy. The roasted mushroom pizza had a nice earthy taste from the mushrooms, some salty bites from the pancetta, and creaminess from the fresh mozzarella. There was no sauce on the pizza, and I did miss the tomato flavor on the pizza a bit. The crust, while a nice balance of crispy and chewy, was burnt around the sides.

sxNMGQwUuaDsviR4BtuX0g,10,2016-12-14,10,x5q2Hd8n3q_Z-dcZaZQ-EA,2,"I just don't get the idea of instant ice cream whether it's this rolled ice cream using an anti-griddle or the liquid nitrogen quick making of ice cream.  Their products shouldn't be called ice cream because they're not in the classic sense.

I wondered what all the hype was about rolled ice cream and I decided to give the place a try.  I came at just the right time in a way because shortly a number of families came in and the line got long.  My wait was probably 15 minutes and others would be waiting beyond that amount of time.

When my turn came, I went with the pumpkin pie.  I thought that's seasonal and when I come back I can get the Nutella.  I don't need to worry about the Nutella because I won't be back.  The young woman explained there were two sizes, a smaller one and the regular.  I went with the regular.  She took three small pieces of pumpkin pie from a container and put them on the anti-grill.  She then poured the cream(?) liquid into a ring for measuring purposes and then picked up the ring.  She then started chopping the pie pieces and mixing it into the liquid and then pulled it all together in a mound in front of her.

The next step is to thinly spread that mixture into a rectangle.  When that's done, the worker takes the scraper and slowly rolls a section of the frozen mixture.  This continues until there are five rolls.  Then using a pair of tongs, the rolls are stacked in the cup and you have the option for whipped cream.  Extra toppings are an additional cost.

All the seats inside were taken so I sat outside.  My problem with this process is that the result is not creamy.  As I gathered some ice cream from the rolls, pieces would fleck off onto to table and me.  There is no cream.  It is dry.  Even as I was finishing the last of the rolls, there was little liquid.  The flavor of pumpkin was intense and for that the process is great.  As for making ice cream, they freeze dry the cream and thus it's just not creamy.

The wait is long and certainly not worth it in my opinion.  The staff with whom I interacted were really personable and helpful.  But when I want ice cream, I'll stick to the traditional method of making creamy ice cream and avoid the show.  I'll even have frozen yogurt before I ever have this again.

I actually tried to go to the Scottsdale location a few months back but the wait to get a table was so long that we decided to eat somewhere else. We were in the area and saw that the Tempe location had just opened so we figured we should check it out!

The location is a bit hidden, right next to the Brickyard garage exit off of 6th Street. There is outdoor and indoor seating and in the winter they have heaters out if you do decide to eat on the patio. It was fairly busy when we came here on Saturday in the afternoon but we were able to get a seat with no wait. 

The menu has an extensive selection of burgers and drinks. They have a daily happy hour from 11-6 which includes discounted drinks. Every burger can be made into a 5 oz relapse size or 10 oz rehab size, and there are multiple protein options, such as beef, turkey, and veggie patty. Feeling in a spicy mood, I opted for the ghost burger, labeled as such due to the inclusion of ghost pepper cheese. I tried some of the chili cheeseburger as well.

Since it was pretty busy it took some time for our orders to get out to our table. Service was good though as we were waiting and drinks were refilled as needed. The plates were impressive looking. The execution though left something to be desired. Our burgers were supposed to be medium rare but came out more like medium to medium well. The burger itself had a dense tough texture, not very juicy, and didn't have a lot of flavor in it aside from a faint taste of char from the grill. I did enjoy the guacamole but the cheese wasn't fully melted in the center of the burger and had a slight grainy texture. The ghost pepper in it was actually not too spicy. I'd say it was about the spiciness of a jalapeno. The pretzel bun was decent but I didn't really enjoy it with my particular burger. 

The chili cheeseburger was admirably smothered in a large amount of chili. The taste itself was OK, nothing spectacular, and I had the same problem with the beef patty being too densely brick-like in texture and lacking in flavor.

The fries were light and crisp, dusted with some seasoned salt and very plentiful.

Since it was so busy they seemed a bit rushed for us to finish and get our table cleared. Everyone here though was friendly and attentive.

I'll give them another try; maybe another type of burger will taste better.",26,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Our dress consultant was very nice and helpful and great when we came here again to pick out bridesmaid dresses. However, scheduling is disorganized for the tailor. Oftentimes when we came here for an appointment it wasn't in the books despite reserving the time way in advance and receiving an appointment card for the date.

I also had my bridesmaid dress altered here. The alteration services cost more than the dress! Had I known the cost in advance I probably would have taken it to an independently owned tailoring shop and had it done there. The actual tailoring of my dress though was good and the tailors were nice. 

My friend's wedding dress alterations were a different story. For some reason the tailor was stuck on giving her a certain bustle and did not offer her any other options. When she discovered a day later that there were actually a few different bustle types she immediately asked to change it and make another appointment which apparently did not sit well with them. When my friend got the bustle changed to the style she wanted even the associates here said that bustle looked a lot better than the one the tailor was going to offer her.

Since they have their home in Summerlin, their first stop for pick up is at Red Rock Resort.  I drove there and parked in the garage.  They arrived right on time, and one person from the hotel went with me as the van took us to the Hacienda Hotel where the groups get their paperwork in order with the government person.  This is necessary because of the heightened security at the dam.

From the Hacienda, we were driven to the launch area just south of Hoover Dam along the Colorado.  It was a wonderful morning with lots of sun and little wind.  

There are several stops as you make your way from hoover Dam to Willow Beach in Arizona--an 11 mile trip.  The first stop is at Sauna Cave, a long test boring done before the dam was constructed.  There is very warm water that steams up camera lenses quickly, and for some people, claustrophobia may be a problem.  Sauna Cave is only a 1/2 mile or so down the river.  

The next stop is lower Goldstrike Canyon.  There are several hot springs in the canyon and a few warm waterfalls.  There is one area where the water temperatures are about 110 degrees.  Goldstrike is only a few hundred yards south of Sauna Cave.  

From here, you kayak 3+ miles to the Arizona Hot Springs, which is about 4 miles from the beginning of the trip.  Here you get a chance to climb up a new ladder that goes to the hot springs beyond this waterfall.  Since I got careless before arriving here, my camera got wet when I tipped my kayak getting out and I have no photos from here on except the ones when I hiked to the Hot Springs.

After the springs, you travel 3 more miles and then stop for a lunch break.  After the lunch break, the trip continues downstream where you can see Emerald Cave and then the river gauging system before finishing the last two miles to Willow Beach.  The Evolution van will be waiting.  You just get out, go get a soda or snack, and they load the kayaks onto the trailer.  Then they drive you back to your hotel.

The tacos were good with the chicken mole being my favorite.  I thought the other two were OK. The rice was standard and the chips and refried beans were OK, too.  The corn would have been better if it had more chili powder but I'm sure they use what the average customer would like rather than what I prefer.

Service was great and the friendliness of the staff was exceptional!

If I were rating the place solely on atmosphere, it would be 5 stars all the way.  The interior design was well planned and it's a very inviting place.  I need to come back and try some other tacos and ask for more chili on my corn.  It's easy getting here from where I live.

For those uncertain, exit the 215 at Russell Road and head west.  Halfway from the 215 to Fort Apache, there's a left turn into the Gramercy complex.  Drive a semi-circular path around the back of the building along Russell.  Just keep going past the coffee house.  Shortly after an open space, there's another building and Pinches is in the corner of that building.  You can see the 215 and the signs from the parking area.  On leaving keep going around the semi-circle and you'll be back to Russell very quickly.",18,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

They have some of the best hummus I've had since moving back here.  I've also been happy with their kibbee dish, which is kind of like the Middle Eastern version of meatloaf.  Food is prepared quickly, and while they do charge $.50 for any soda refills, I don't mind so much as long as they keep making that divine chicken shawarma.

All the staff were smiling, no one walked by without checking my table to see if I needed anything or to remove a dirty dish or pick up and empty Sweet 'n Low packet.  My server was Haydee, and she was marvelous!

I got the Ducasse Classics, the grand tasting menu.  Before ordering, I asked the area manager for my section of the restaurant--who took my order--if I could switch dessert because I didn't want to have the Baba Au Rhum with the small bottles of rum and cream alternately poured on the cake.  He had me look at their à la carte menu and pick any dessert from that--even the soufflé and he would substitute.  That's customer service and it's very accommodating. 

Bread basket:  Standard types of bread.  One in particular had red bell pepper baked in it.  That was great!  There was regular butter in a small holder with two sides.  On the other side was a peanut butter spread.  It was excellent when you let it come to room temperature.  Heavenly flavors.

The courses:

Amuse bouche:  Mango and shrimp coulis with sliced daikon and sliced red radish.  Very light and tasty.

Appetizer:  Potato gnocchi with two varieties of mushrooms, sunchoke, parmigiano reggiano with veal jus.  There were a couple of baby escarole pieces that just set off the presentation of the items.  The gnocchi were absolutely the softest gnocchi I have had!  Superb!

Fish:  Roasted Maine lobster ""au curry"" on bed of coconut basmati rice.  There was not much curry flavor at all which would please some because there was certainly no flavor to overwhelm the delicate and sweet lobster. I tasted no coconut flavor in the basmati rice.     One small glitch here--there was a piece of lobster shell I bit into.  Now, if I were Scott Conant on ""Chopped"" I would have made that deep frown and made some remark about good chefs being careful about what they serve.  It happens and was no big deal.

Meat:  Filet mignon Rossini.  A perfectly cooked filet--rare just as I asked with a large piece of delicate foie gras and several slices of black truffle.  It's the first truffle I ever had.  Before, someone merely waved some truffle above the food and said, ""OK, here's your xxxxxxx with black truffle oil.""  This was very tasty!

Pre-dessert:  A martini glass with a passion fruit base and a rum foam for a topping.  Very refreshing and an excellent palate cleanser.

Dessert:  miX Candy Bar.  A candy bar made with alternate layers of graham cracker and chocolate all dipped in chocolate.  There was some edible gold leaf on the candy bar.  With it was a lime coconut sorbet.  The lime was very dominating such that again I tasted no coconut.  They must use only a small amount of coconut flavoring.

Post dessert, dessert:  A different server brings to your table some warm Madeleines in their mold fresh from the oven.  You remove your own Madeleines with your fingers.  You also get a small bowl of Nutella with a very small spoon to spread the heavenly hazelnut-chocolate goodness on your Madeleine.

The menu is pretty varied, with a mix of uniquely Moroccan foods, French food, Italian gelato, milkshakes, Mediterranean/Middle Eastern style food, and even French Canadian food (Poutine). It is quite a fusion of different cultures! I was excited to try their tagine. It is rare to find a restaurant that even offers this delectable dish. The prices were reasonable too, cheaper than what I've found at other restaurants that offer it. 

We first started out with the zaaluk appetizer ($3.99). It was a blend of roasted eggplant and tomato, served with pita bread. We each ordered a beef with prunes tagine ($11.99) and a chicken tagine ($11.99). They came with a hearty portion of rice, and a basket of bread.

The beef was tender, with a delightful combination of savory and sweet flavors, and the sesame seeds provided an added textural difference with the soft, slow-cooked meat, fruit and vegetables. The chicken didn't seem like it was finished in a tagine (It seemed like it was roasted instead), since the meat and skin were browned and it didn't have the very moist, tender texture that a typical chicken tagine has. The spices and sauce itself was good though, and I liked the potatoes and green olives it came with. I enjoyed the light, fluffy rice with slightly crisp caramelized bits, and the bread went well with the tagines.

I also tried an Agadir milkshake ($5). It was touted as having almond gelato, milk, and honey. It was presented beautifully, but looking at it closer, I think I actually received a vanilla milkshake because I could see the bits of vanilla bean in it and I didn't actually taste any almond flavor. It was a lighter tasting milkshake, still good, but not super thick like most American style milkshakes are. It was more like a ""milk drink"" instead of a ""milkshake"".

Service was friendly and warm, and we were checked up on as needed. The restaurant occupies the space that Jorge's Chicken and Waffles used to be in, juxtaposing a hip, urban interior with more traditional Moroccan designs. The restaurant is open late, which is a draw for me (Until 11 P.M. or later depending on the day).

Yiz2cRBakfVUOHsThLKyoQ,7,2017-05-02,4,-80AWlMyCzj56L5XAuyFOA,3,"I first heard of this place when Arizona Charlie's changed the steakhouse from what it was to Ron's.  And, it hasn't been on the radar since I never go to Arizona Charlie's.  Yesterday, that changed when I was unable to meet a friend for a show on the Strip in time for the start of the show.  I started home from the Smith Center trying to think of a place to have dinner when Ron's popped into my head.

I found a space on the surface lot on the north side of the casino and walked in the side door.  I was totally lost.  It's probably been 12 years since I was here.  One thing never changes--there was the smell of cigarette smoke everywhere.  I walked a short distance trying to get my bearings and when I looked to my right, there was Ron's.  A quick dash and I was inside their door and the casino noise and cigarette smoke was behind me.

The woman at the podium seated me immediately and I was told my server would be Maria.  That was the win of the night--she is fantastic!

After looking at the menu, I opted to go à la carte skipping a few 3 course meals on the menu.  For a starter, I got escargot.  The main meal was a 14 oz. NY strip steak that comes with soup or salad.  I opted for the salad.  I asked about the size of the sides and Maria explained that the fries were large portions.  When I asked about the au gratin potatoes, she said they were a more modest serving.  I ended the meal with chocolate cake.

My iced tea was brought immediately and it was refilled twice without needing to ask.  Used sweetener packs were removed from the table.  The bread service consisted of two pieces of lavash and some slices of Bon Breads raisin walnut.  There were three cups of butter served--one a garlic herb, one a cinnamon sugar, and one regular.  I wasn't a fan of the cinnamon but I can see why people would like it with the raisin bread.  I was not impressed with the lavash.  It was old and lacked the cheese flavor it was supposed to have.

The escargot was good.  Each was topped with a round of puff pastry.  The pastry puffs were somewhat hard.  The thing to do here is move the puffs aside, eat the escargot, and then push the pastry into the ample garlic butter and let it soak up that goodness.  They did not spare the garlic at all.

The salad was small and was made with a slice or two of thin cucumber acting as the ""bowl"" with greens inside and the bleu cheese dressing on the side.  Nice concept.

The steak was good albeit a bit tough.  It's not listed on the menu as any class of prime or and other USDA designation.  I was cooked the way I wanted it and the seasoning on it was good.  The au gratin potatoes were excellent and the serving size was perfect for a solo diner.  The prices for the sides were less than many steakhouses in the city.

To finish this meal, I opted for the chocolate cake with fresh berries.  It was a good choice.

I'm not sure if I'd come back to Ron's but if I did I think I would consider one of the 3 course, prix fixe meals.",8,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I didn't know SHe by Morton's existed until I saw it on the Restaurant Week list.  SInce I've eaten at most places in Aria and have yet to try more than Mastro's in Crystals, I put this on my list for restaurant week.

Course 1:  I started with a Caesar salad.  It was quite a large serving.  It had just the right amount of dressing and the croutons were flat pieces of crusty, toasted bread almost like little Melba toast rounds.

Course 2:  I ordered the marinated skirt steak extra rare.  When the steak came out, it was a 6 ounce filet they were substituting.  It had an excellent char and was bright pink rather than being the red it should have been.

Course 3:  For this course, you have a choice of one side.  I chose the wild mushrooms.  They were excellent and there was a large amount.  If two people were dining, two of these sides would be more than enough to share.  It would have been nice if I could have gotten half portions of two sides, but I understand the need for conformity.

Course 4:  I went with the Shesecake.  On their menu, it has this description:  Cream Cheese Bavarian, Champagne Strawberries.  There was a sprig of lavender on the top and some graham cracker crumbles on the side besides the graham crust.  The Shesecake was very, very good.  It was not like any cheesecake I had before.  I'm glad I read Heather's review before I went.  Because she stated the cinnamon twists were blah, I had to go with the Shesecake.

Service was excellent.  Before being taken to your table, your asked to sit at the bar while the table is readied.  It's actually a way of forcing you to buy a drink.  I got a diet Coke and took that to the table with me.  During the meal, my server came around and asked if it was regular or diet.  With 1/3 of a glass to go, he still removed that and gave me a fresh drink.  He then brought me a small plate with sliced lemon wedges for the soda.  

He was around several times.  After each course was delivered, he checked to make sure everything was OK.  The staff was very on top of the restaurant during the time I was there, and they really move.

I almost opted for patio seating, but I decided to eat indoors to see the interior as this was my first visit.  I'm glad I did.  I still had a chance to watch tourists walk by outside the windows, and I had a good view of part of the Aria Hotel.  

I am pleased that SHe by Morton's participated in Restaurant Week and I'll be returning to try some of their seafood offerings.  The menu is tempting!",1,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I looked at your menu and my mouth watered at all the Southern style favorites you served, such as jambalaya, pulled pork, po' boys, fried okra, and gumbo. However, while I did enjoy a few items here, my experience wasn't too great overall.

We came here on a weekend for a late dinner, and were seated promptly. There are various non alcoholic and alcoholic drinks to choose from, including a few varieties of iced tea and lemonade. I chose the watermelon iced tea ($2.99). It came served in a tall mason jar, with a large wedge of fresh watermelon in the drink. It was quite refreshing with great tea and watermelon flavor. Along with the drinks, we received a basket of sweet butter with light, buttery biscuits (Free, unlimited refills).

As for appetizers, we opted for the fried okra ($3.99 half portion). It was quite a large portion, with a light, crispy breaded outer layer. The okra itself tasted tender, with not a lot of the ""slimy"" texture okra can get. It was served with a spicy ranch and creole mustard sauce. Out of the two, I preferred the mustard better. It was made with whole mustard seeds and its flavor and consistency complimented the breaded, fried, okra better than the thinner, more one-dimensional flavor of the ranch.

I opted for the catfish po' boy sandwich ($11.99), and tried some of the pulled pork sandwich ($10.99). The catfish po' boy looked amazing! It was a huge portion of French bread with large, battered catfish nuggets, mayo with capers, tomatoes, and lettuce. However, the sandwich itself had some problems. The bread was really dry and tasted slightly old, and one of the catfish nuggets was still slightly raw. Setting that undercooked catfish nugget aside, I continued eating the rest of the sandwich, to find an unusual hard chunk while chewing. That hard chunk turned out to be a piece of fish bone stuck in one of the nuggets! 

I had the braised greens as a side, which had a nice smokey flavor with very soft, tender greens from cooking ""low and slow."" However, as I ate more, I got bits of grit while eating, meaning that they didn't rinse the greens enough before cooking them.

The pulled pork sandwich was better, but not particularly remarkable. I did enjoy the array of bbq sauces on the table to add to the sandwich though.

Prices for me, seem a bit high. They do have a nice looking happy hour and reverse happy hour at the bar every day, offering discounted drinks and appetizers which I might be tempted to try out some day.

As with most Filipino restaurants, it's best to come with a group because portions are large and you want to try different things.  I was looking forward to the lechon but when I saw that the smallest portion was 8 ounces, I decided to hold off on that until I come with a family who adopts me or a group of friends.

Instead of eating too much, I opted for a small starter of Ngo-yong, deep freind palm heart flavored with Chinese 5 spice powder.  There was a dipping sauce served with it that had the wonderful five spice flavors.  A very good start and a smaller starter.

In Chris Bianco's Italian Restaurant.
* * * * 

Within the Town and Country shopping center lies Chris Bianco's Italian Restaurant, a nod to simple, unpretentious Italian-American cuisine.  There is an emphasis on home-made, fresh ingredients, as is evident in the hand-made pastas and slow-cooked meats.

We were first served some lovely crostini with a creamy cheese (Maybe ricotta?).  We also decided on getting the cheese platter appetizer, which consisted of Brie, sheep's milk cheese, and goat milk cheese with orange marmalade and candied pecans.  It was served with a basket of bread, and a single buttery looking crostini on the cheese plate.  The bread was a little too chewy for my tastes, but the cheeses were quite nice, especially with the marmalade and pecans.  

For main courses, I ordered the crespelle, and also tried the porchetta and papardelle.  The crespelle is like the Italian version of a savory crepe.  It had freshly made ricotta, spinach, and garlic, with a hearty, chunky tomato sauce.  The crespelle tasted decent, although there were large halved pieces of garlic in the filling that still had some ""bite"" to them because they weren't fully cooked.  The papardelle I tried had a nice meaty ragu to accompany the fresh pasta.  The porchetta was easily the best item out of all our meals.  The slow-roasted pork was very tender, and the sauce had a nice full flavor that matched well with the pork, black-eyed peas, and root vegetables.  

I was kind of torn on what to give Italian Restaurant rating-wise, since the pasta dishes, although impressive that they were freshly made, just tasted OK to me (A 3 star for just the pasta).  However, the porchetta and friendly service helped tip the scales so I'll upgrade to a 4 star rating.",4,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Another good deal is the spring special: Filet mignon and lobster tail with salad or soup, and mashed potato or green beans, for $35.  The filet was also very tender, perfectly cooked, and the lobster was full of flavor, and they will cut it off the shell for you if you desire.  The salmon is also good, perfectly seasoned and nicely cooked.

The vibe here is like the small specialty markets you'll find in San Francisco.  Most items here will be Korean brand, or geared towards Korean type food and living.  In addition to food and beverage, they sell some household goods, makeup, and accessories.  

They have a very good selection of sliced plain meat (For bbq or hot pot), in addition to a small row of containers with marinated meats sold by the pound.  They had 4 types, and from what I could discern (Since I can't read Korean), there were marinated short ribs, beef bulgolgi, pork, and maybe some type of pork belly?  It was pretty reasonably priced (On sale, beef bulgolgi $4.49/lb, pork $3.99/lb), and if I'm in a carnivorous mood it's a good option for making a Korean meal at home.  They also have the requisite kimchi aisle, with various brands and types of kimchi.  I browsed and found a few brands from L.A., and a brand imported from Korea.

WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,9,2013-12-08,4,BJkyl_0sfHDf-SGsvOHGKA,3,"My thoughts about Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak are about how good the appetizer was and how ordinary the rest of the meal was.

I wanted to try one of the heritage steaks but when I didn't want the bone in 18 ounce ribeye--just too much food--and my server suggested I go with the regular ribeye, a smaller cut.  For a starter I ordered the charred octopus that's so highly recommended by the reviews.  For dessert, I had to try the S'mores Fritters.

I was brought a bottle of still water in a Heritage Steak labeled bottle.  There was no charge for bottled water as I feared.  I also ordered an iced tea.  Both drinks were a bit slow in being brought but it was OK_I was in no hurry.  A runner also brought me a bread basked of two rolls and a small plate with a round of butter with cracked salt on half of the round.

The appetizer was superb!  The appetizer size was just right and the octopus was perfectly cooked.  It had a nice zing to it from the red peppers that were on top.  It was a grand way to start the meal.

My steak came next and I was taken aback by the way it looked.  Here was a nice piece of beef that had a glop of something on it.  As it turned out, it onion-balsamic relish and roasted onions, but it looked so odd.  I wondered who came up with this plating idea.  I had asked for the steak to be cooked blue.  The server asked if I wanted it charred on each side blue or just blue and not charred.  I wanted just blue.  It was cooked beyond this and it soon went to a medium rare rather than even rare.  

For dessert I had the S'mores fritters.  This was an OK dessert but there was nothing special about the deconstructed S'more.  It's a cute idea, but what it turns out to be are three doughnut hole-like chocolate rounds, several dots of marshmallow that are flamed brownish, and some gelato on Graham cracker crumbs.  The gelato was supposed to be Graham cracker flavor, but it really had little flavor of its own.  The taste of Graham came from the crumbs beneath the gelato.  

Service was generally very good.  Someone was around to refill my water glass with the bottled water and dirty plates were removed quickly.  The only hiccup was a wait for a second iced tea.

I was underwhelmed by the meal.  It was OK and the appetizer was more than that.  It just wasn't up to the highest standards I would expect of this celebrity chef.

End of review and beginning of side story:

After I took a photo of something during the early part of my meal, I noticed a flash go off in my direction and a woman had snapped my photo with her iPhone.  She was with a party of four and she said she wanted a photo of someone really enjoying their job.

Later when my meal was complete, she came over and sat across from me and asked if I was a food critic or a ""Yelpie.""  I proudly stated that I was a Yelpie.  She then went on to talk about the meal and ask my thoughts.  When I pretty much said what I wrote here, she talked about her steak which was supposed to medium rare came out raw.  She sent it back and the second one was correct.  I had noticed that she was eating while her husband and the other couple had finished and their plates were cleared.  She suggested that I try the Cowboy Steak at another restaurant, one very close to Heritage Steak.  The four of them thought it was a great steak.

The makeover does not disappoint except the partitions take away the view of the waterfalls in the landscaping unless you get a table by one of the windows.

We were seated promptly and brought water and iced tea.  Before we ordered, a server arrived with two 'blocks' of bread--one multi-grain and one plain--and there was a knife for cutting the squares out.  You could pull it apart also.

Two of us ordered the sweet potato gnocchi with lobster and one got the petit filet.  The gnocchi/lobster duo with the spaghetti squash was a creative dish and shellfish butter helped bring the items together.  They were not skimpy with the lobster.  My friend's filet was cooked properly and he said it was good.  He had a baked potato but the two of us with the gnocchi skipped a side dish saving room for dessert.

For dessert, I had the citrus lemon meringue tart with raspberry coulis and raspberry white chocolate ice cream.  My friend ordered the caramel mascarpone cheesecake that she shared with her husband.  We both were very pleased with our desserts.  The lemon meringue tart was excellent.

Service was very good.  Iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass and we were checked on during dinner to make sure all was going well.

The taco was very tasty and I ate the onions and peppers almost as a side dish.  Another thing different about El Gordo is that you can get either flour or corn tacos.  I got the corn this time and it was quite flavorful.  The tacos here are smaller than at the other places we stopped, but they are good and worth the price with the vegetable dish.  At $2, the place is on par with the other taco places in the area.

A little difference with this place is that you pick up a tray and place your ordered dishes on it.  Then you go to the cashier and pay for what you ordered.  It's very much cafeteria style.  Last night was quite busy and when our group arrived, we got a lot of stares.

The interior is adorable, with crystal chandeliers and French inspired accents on the wall. The menu is a mix of baked goods, sandwiches, salads, soups, and in the evenings from Wednesday to Saturday they offer a selection of entrees for dinner.

After browsing through the menu I decided to be as French as I could be (Without the miming and the funny little hats), ordering the French onion soup ($8.50) and the salade nicoise ($11.25). The soup came out first, piping hot, with a cheesy mixture of cheddar and swiss on top, slightly caramelized. It was salty and rich, but I wasn't a big fan of the crouton (Which was a tad too gummy tasting for me when it came out) and the cheese (I like Gruyere better as the topping). The broth itself was decent, but I recently ate at Coup des Tartes which has an amazing French onion soup which this version doesn't quite compare to. This version was more one dimensional and thus had a less rounded taste to it. There were also less caramelized onions in this version.

The salad came out and looked like a tub of greens it was so big! It was filled to the brim with crisp vegetables, mixed greens, olives, tuna, and a side of creamy dressing. Looking at photos of other versions of salade nicoise I was surprised this one was so creamy, since the tuna was more like a creamy tuna salad, and the dressing wasn't very vinaigrette-like. I think I would have preferred a more traditional version of this salad, one that was more tangy than creamy. To each their own though!

We ended the meal sharing a rum baba and the special dessert of the moment, the mogador. The rum baba was a dense cake soaked in a light sugary rum sauce. I loved the candied citrus in the cake. The more I ate of it though the more it got too sweet for my taste buds though. The mogador was interesting. I enjoyed the combination of raspberry with chocolate, but the whipped topping didn't really have a lot of flavor and was hard, approaching frozen status in the center.

This would be a three star review if not for the outstanding service we received.  This was an afterthought when I was looking at the RW offerings.  I decided it was wife friendly (it's difficult to get her to try different things).  

We came here in the late afternoon.  I had checked the times online and the Tommy Bahama website said dinner was from 4 on.   We were there at 4:30 and got the lunch RW menu and were told that dinner service begins at 5 PM.  That's where our server, Naomi, showed us what the service would be like.  She went to the kitchen and then came back.  After collecting our lunch menus, she went to the stand and brought back the dinner menus.

I started with the coconut shrimp with an Asian slaw.  The shrimp were resting on a mango-papaya chutney.  My wife had the classic Caesar--romaine leaves with Grana Padano cheese and garlic croutons.  Both were good starters.  My shrimp  had little coconut flavor.

During our starters, Naomi brought some hot bread from the kitchen.  They serve the bread with a cinnamon butter which is quite good.  I thought it was odd that they had no bread plates.  I happened to have my starter plater so I could use that.

For the main courses, I got the pork loin and my wife got the parmesan crusted Sanibel chicken breast--a selection not shown on their online RW menu but a good choice.  Naomi asked how I liked the pork--medium and I said rare to medium-rare.  I didn't want the meat too dead.  It was cooked too much and it wasn't a bit juicy.  It was a huge loin--almost like they took a loin and cut it in half.  It was served with asparagus and 6 silver dollar size sweet potato pancakes.  The sides were very good!  My wife's chicken was good.  Her chicken came on a bed of garlic mashed and some broccolini.  

For dessert, I got the piña colada cake and my wife got the four layer triple chocolate cake.  Excellent and once again, a large portion.

Iced tea was refilled promptly without asking.  Naomi was always around without being intrusive and she had a sparkling personality!  She makes this a 4 star review.

The bread basket consisted of a couple of pieces of tasty lavash and two rolls, one a walnut and raisin and the other I don't know because I didn't want to fill up on bread.  The butter comes with a piece of processed cheese spread with grapes and cranberries.  Very tasty!

I started with a house salad that comes with all entrées.  It's built almost like a small Cobb salad with greens in the middle and small mounds of diced tomato, bleu cheese, candied walnuts, hearts of palm, cucumber, and hard boiled egg around the perimeter.  I got bleu cheese dressing and the salad was very good.

My main course was the 8 ounce filet done black and blue.  With the steak came some summer vegetables cooked very little.  They were crispy and they were good!  I ordered a salted baked potato as a side.  My steak was done perfectly and the baked potato with that rich salt was very, very good.

For dessert, I got the Canal Street bread pudding with blueberries and a Bourbon whiskey vanilla sauce.  The bread pudding was different.   Not only was there the vanilla sauce, but the bread had a distinct chocolate infusion and there was chocolate sauce along with the vanilla.  Excellent.

Service was very good.  Iced tea was refilled without asking, finished dishes were removed promptly, and there was adequate time between courses to relax and enjoy the surroundings.  I wasn't rushed nor was service slow.

I like the room.  It has a New Orleans theme with one side being a mural.  In about an hour's time, the lights on the mural slowly dim and the fluorescent paint starts to glow with the blue lights and it looks like the lights in the mansion along the river or on the paddle wheel boat were turned on.  Then the lights slowly pick up and eventually it's daytime again.  I've always liked that ambiance and it was there again last night.",4,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA,15,2016-07-10,7,k1OdAycPnedOt-oQhaJ0pQ,4,"Had a lovely girl's night out at Sel. The interior is modern with a white theme to echo the restaurant's name which is ""salt"" in French. The menu changes every few weeks (I think every 2 weeks the server said), so eating here will typically be a new experience each time you go.

They offer a 4 course prix fixe meal for $70 as well as a la carte items. If you go with the prix fixe you will have a choice of your appetizer and main entree while the soup and salad will be only one choice. I went with the prix fixe, choosing the lobster stuffed squash blossom and halibut with green curry cassoulet. The soup was a yellow tomato gazpacho and the salad was a gravlax vinaigrette salad with mixed greens.

Each course was thoughtfully prepared, with a beautiful presentation. Seasoning was perfect, and the combination of textures and flavors of each dish was excellent. My favorite of the prix fixe menu was the lobster stuffed squash blossom. The delicate taste of the squash blossom went well with the lobster meat, and the breaded crispy outer layer of the blossom was perfect. I also have to say this is the best gazpacho I've had by far. It was a smooth, refreshing cold soup and the sweet peach gratinee in the center provided a great contrast with the more acidic taste of the tomatoes. The main entree was lovely, with a tender, perfectly cooked halibut and exotic tasting ""cassoulet"" with the addition of green curry.

Service was excellent. Plates were taken away and water was refilled as needed. Our server was friendly and warm. 

Even the water here is quite delicious, as it is steeped with cucumber and mint. I'll have to try this at home!

Dessert was a heavenly strawberry shortcake made with marizpan, a quenelle of vanilla bean gelato, caramel drizzle and balsamic vinegar. 

The four course meal was just right for me. I'm glad I shared the dessert because I don't think I'd be able to finish the whole thing if I hadn't.

The only thing that bothered me was when the filet mignon dishes came out for the people at our table, each piece was differently sized. My friend sitting across from me got a significantly smaller piece of filet compared to her neighbor. If we are paying $70 for our meal you bet each dish needs to be consistent and have the same amount of food.

Overall 4.5/5.",19,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,10,2014-04-20,5,Gpo-2lh59Bru8sKqgRm5Hw,3,"5 of us met again to try a new restaurant and try different food.  I have had Forte bookmarked for about 2 years but I never seemed to think of this place.  

We were seated at two high top tables right as you come in the door.  While we were looking at the menu and talking about other things, we were approached for our order.  We asked her to wait awhile as we kept studying what we wanted.

We were soon brought some bread.  They were large round puffs larger and flatter than a doughnut.  There was olive oil on the table and we pulled pieces off the bread to dip in the oil.  It was good.

Our things started coming out.  The first plate was a shared Spanish ""nacho"" platter.  It consisted of some chips with thin chorizo slices and topped with a tasty truffle salsa.

We were brought two orders of meat pies that were also good.  Next came a dish stuffed baby squid served over Spanish herb rice.  

We also ordered each of their specialty breads--a feta cheese stuffed filo dough round and Adjarski Khachapurri, described as traditional Georgian boat shaped bread filled with two types of Georgian styled pickled cheeses and a cracked egg mixed on top (after our photos).  Both were good breads.  It was difficult cutting the Georgian bread with the egg but we managed to mangle it enough that everyone got a chance to try some.  The filo round was easy.  All we had to do was pull a piece of the roll off and dip it in the sour cream if we wanted.  The bread was brought straight from the oven because it was extremely hot.

We had two orders of almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates with a sherry reduction.  The dates were OK but I thought they were cooked a bit too much.

Next came some Easter or spring lamb with some mashed potatoes and some salad.  I didn't think the lamb had much of the lamb flavor I was expecting and it was in a dark sauce.  I guess I'm too used to having lamb rare and not done in a stew manner.  It was extremely tender.

We closed out this part of lunch with the Thracian clay pot described on the menu as a ""traditional Bulgarian specialty of tomatoes, peppers, onion, feta, Bulgarian style charcuterie, and egg baked in a Bulgarian clay pot.  For me, this was the stand out of our lunch.  it had lots of flavor.  I used some of the spice on the table to give it some extra flavor.  On the table was a spice boat with a small wooden spoon.  The woman told us that it was a mixture of 40 spices with cumin, garlic, salt, and.....  We didn't ask her to continue.

Then dessert was ordered.  We got some baklava and their biscuit cake.  The biscuit cake was the star!  The menu describes it as ""decadent cake layered with honey biscuits, mascarpone, rich chocolate, Lavazza espresso, and a kick of spiced rum topped with walnuts and more chocolate.  Need I write any more?  The baklava was not like I'm used to in how it's made but it was OK.

I thought the food was pretty good.  I wanted to give the place more stars but the part that held me back was the service.  We had asked at the start not to bring all the dishes out but they just kept coming--not all at once--but close enough together that there wasn't a chance to rest a bit between tastings.  The number of plates and fitting them on our two tables became a bit of an issue.  Instead of giving us clean plates periodically, we had the same ones until the main courses were completed.  We got clean plates for dessert.  We also had to ask twice to get more water.  For such a small place with two servers at least, things should have been done better.  

I might go back to try one of the other main dishes.  And of course, getting some more biscuit cake should always be foremost in my mind.

As always, good company made lunch a much better time!",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I was told 15 minutes and that was about exactly right although I was thjere early because they're so close to where I live.

My wife enjoyed the Mexican burger and the fries very much.  My sandwich was good but it's not a Cuban sandwich.  It's pulled pork and a slice of ham with some cheese on a toasted baguette and not a pressed sandwich as every authentic Cuban sandwich should be.  I liked the fries.

The packing for take out was good.  It was firm plastic but on the cold day we had, it wasn't the best insulator.  It wasn't a good day for takeout for most places with the cold.

Instead of chips and salsa, they bring you a nice basket of fried tortillas and bean dip with a small bowl of a little spicy salsa.  You break the tortillas as you want and dip.  

I ordered the soup of the day which was chicken tortilla soup.  It was a tomato based soup with lots of cheese and real chicken with nice tortilla strips.  It was a thicker soup-quite flavorful and something I'd get again.  A bowl of this soup in the winter would be great!

For my main course, I got the Chicken Sarandeado, a grilled chicken breast with their ""special spices.""  With the platter came rice, pico, some guacamole, and refried beans.  This was another tasty dish for Super Mex.  

For dessert, I got the fried ice cream.  It didn't appear as if this ice cream had ever been near a fryer but it was good.  It was simply a ball of vanilla ice cream that had been rolled in a small amount of coating and then frozen.  It was placed in a sweetened tortilla basket and decorated with whipped cream, and some strawberry and chocolate syrup.  Mind you, it was a decadent ending to my meal, but it was not fried as far as I could tell.

I was tempted to give the place 4 stars but I had one BIG hangup with the service.  For the most part, it was very good.  However, I had just started to eat my soup when a server appeared with my main course and set it down.  Why do you do this?  It seems to happen more in Tex-Mex places than anywhere else.

We went into this store looking for some furniture since we just moved back to Arizona.  We walked around, and browsed but we weren't really liking any of the furniture.  No one bothered to ask us if we needed anything, I guess because we look young, which is OK with me since I will usually hunt someone down if I am really interested in something.  BUT, the real kicker was when a salesman cut RIGHT in front of me as I was walking down the pathway and stopped right in my path to ask ANOTHER couple if they needed anything.  It was as if I had never existed to him, and I was just some little gnat that he could just walk in front of and ignore.  Part of me wanted to kick him for cutting in front of me inches from where I was walking, but I decided to walk around.  

When I was in grad school, our instructors always said NEVER underestimate the person you are trying to get business from, no matter how they look.  They told numerous stories of people that may have looked like they couldn't afford things, but then ended up being independently wealthy with lots of disposable income.  Although we look young, we did have money to spend, and as a result of their really atrocious customer service I am never going to set my foot here again.

For starters, we shared the appetizer polpette, baked turkey meatballs in tomato sauce and parmesan cheese.  The meatballs were excellent.  They were juicy and the tomato sauce billed on the menu as San Marzano tomato, was also very good.  It made a nice dish for sharing.

This was the first time in years that we have gotten pizza.  I know that's almost un-American but it's true.  We ordered the quattro fromaggio with bufala mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, and fontina cheeses.  The pizza made 4 large slices and was almost the perfect size for two people.

The show has been around for many years at the Stratosphere before moving to the Plaza so it's not jumping on the vampire movie craze that seems to have gripped the younger people.  

I think the biggest problem is there really is no cohesive story and the show's writers don't know what kind of show they want other than topless (sometimes) female vampires doing different dances in different costumes in different amounts of dress/undress.  There are a couple of small magic tricks done by one of the male vampires and there were some strong man lifts and balances à la Mystère and the guys were OK.  But these disjointed segments of magic, dancing, strong man routines point out the unfocused nature of the show.  The showroom at the Plaza, which I think is a great classing Las Vegas room, is not designed for the types of things they used to do at the Strat.  There used to be some acrobatics done with silks, but that has to be dropped in this showroom.

The music was something else.  There was some 80s rock music and mixed in were two selections from opera that had almost no reason for being where they were.  Most of the music is recorded, but some was live and the singer was not too bad.

An acquaintance was seated at the same table as I was and his reaction was much the same as mine.  OK, I don't need to see this one again.

Next up were:  dry fruit whole wheat bread, Samosa chat, lamb kheema pav, and paneeer tikka and pav bhaji.  There were two winners here--the lamb kheema and the paneer tikka.  I really enjoyed the grilled flavor of the paneer and the lamb had good texture ingredients.  The lamb was served with bun halves that you could make a slider if you wanted.  I chose to use it as a base for the meat.  One real miss here was the dry fruit whole wheat.  I thought it was garlic naan.  I could not tell that there was any stuffing of nuts or raisins in the bread.  

For the mains, we got two curries and the five herb noodles recommended to us by the owner as his favorite dish.  The curries were good with a small amount of meat in each one.

On this dreary cold day I was in a spicy curry mood, and seeing all the great reviews for this restaurant piqued my interest in wanting to try it out. I ordered an avocado curry ($10) and Thai eggplant ($8). On the phone I was only offered ""mild"" or ""medium"" options of spiciness. Kind of odd, do they really not make things ""hot"" spicy? I went with the medium level and my order would be ready for pick up in 20 minutes.

The order was ready right on time and packaged very well. It smelled amazing in the car, and it was a huge portion of food for each dish. The avocado dish is a jazzed up green curry with the addition of sliced and chunk avocados to the mixture of chicken, basil, and other vegetables. I think it was a good ""medium"" level of spiciness, just enough spice to let you know it was there without the need for a fire hydrant's worth of water afterwards. The Thai eggplant was a hefty portion of pork, eggplant, and other veggies and was more delicate tasting than the bold curry.

I was a little miffed by the admission price of $10 per person, but went in with high hopes.  Like others said, there was a distinct lack of shade, and it was also very dusty and a lot of dry grass was being kicked around in the air, making for a very extensive sneezing experience there!  The tacos were fairly small, street taco size, for $2 (1 ticket) a taco.  We arrived around 3:30-4 P.M. and unfortunately some of the taco vendors had already sold out of their tacos, which limited our selection.  They had also sold out of diet soda.  

I was annoyed that a volunteer continually harassed me at the drink booth telling me I needed to go get my ID checked at a totally different section of the booth when I had told him multiple times that all I wanted was a soda.  He had made it seem like a very big deal that I was getting a drink there without ID check (Even though I am WELL over the age of 21!).  I was very close to the front of the line, so I was NOT going to get out of line on a very hot day when there are huge lines to get my ID checked just to get a stinking soda!  When I went to the front to order my soda, the ladies taking tickets and getting drinks didn't care how old I was, why should he?  After I left with my soda, the volunteer stopped me again, saying ""Oh, so they let you get the drink?""  Well... yeah, I have it in my hand, so yes (Was that not obvious?).

In general, I'm glad I went to this festival to say I did experience it, but I don't think I'll be going again in the future.  There is a lot of room for improvement that still can be done, plus I go to festivals to have fun, not to get harassed if I want a soda at a booth that sells alcohol.",5,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

My burger was on a pretzel bun, and while I appreciate the unique experience of eating burger and pretzel, the bun was swimming with grease.  It was as if the fat/grease from the burger had all diffused into the neighboring territory of the bun, since we had dry burger and way too greasy bun.  

Service was mediocre.  The waitress came back multiple times after we had given her our orders to reconfirm what we had gotten, because she had forgotten what we had told her.

The place was almost empty and after ordering my Greek Scramble and coffee, I took a seat at a table under the section near the entrance that has a roof overhead.  The young lady who took my order, gave me a post with a number so she'd know where the food was to be delivered.  She soon brought my coffee which was very hot and enjoyable.

The Greek scramble consisted of scrambled egg whites with feta cheese, kalamata olives, basil, green peppers, onions, and was accompanied by tofu home fries.  Their information lists this at 309 calories.  I wasn't concerned so much about that as I was taste.

The taste was quite good.  The olives brought out the flavor of the feta and the tofu home fries were a treat.  There were some pieces of toasted pita to accompany the scramble.

I will stop in again and try something else.  The price was very reasonable and the patio dining was perfect before the hot days set in.

We arrived about 30 minutes after the start of dinner service on a weekend with no reservation, and although there was already a line of people waiting for tables, we didn't have to wait long (Maybe 5-10 minutes).

The menu is quite extensive, and spans various regions of Thailand. The alcohol list is also equally as extensive, for those that choose to have some with their meal. After reading the great reviews about the drunken noodles, I decided on the seafood drunken noodles ($13). I had other people in my party get chicken pad Thai and chicken panang. 

The drunken noodles came in a flavorful brown sauce, cooked well. I wasn't too impressed with the seafood mixture though. It looked like it came out of one of those cheaper seafood mixes you get in the freezer section at the Asian grocery store. It had pre-cut slices of calamari, scallops, mussels, and imitation crab. The seafood itself tasted just OK. The calamari did taste a little tough though. 

I asked for the dish ""medium"" spice level, and I thought it was spot-on. It was spicy enough to give you some kick to your meal, but mild enough that you won't be drowning yourself in gallons of water to cool off from the heat. The person that had the chicken pad Thai was very satisfied with her meal, and the person that had the chicken panang thought it was good, albeit also a little pricy for what he got.

Service was excellent despite it being very busy. Plates were taken as needed and drinks were refilled fairly promptly.

The bread basket had a pretzel roll, lavosh, and two pieces of Bon Breads batards.  Nice basket selection.

Coure 1 - Almas Ara Caviar served on a bed of lemon gelée with some crème fraiche and a sprig of dill.  The gelée filled a hollowed out lemon and the caviar and other things were placed on top of the gelée,

Coure 2 - Bacon wrapped shrimp with papaya mustard and cilantro.  

Course 3 - Chilean Sea Bass with a miso foam with Yuzu.  

Course 4 - 6 ounce Wagyu filet served on a small bed of spinach and with two rounds of parmesan squash.

Course 5 - Desert was the JG Candy bar.  The candy bar was a mixture of chocolate crunch with caramel peanuts, some candied popcorn, peanut butter, white chocolate, and an oval of whipped cream.

Comments:  I was impressed by the flavor profiles developed in each of the dishes.  The mixture of lemon, dill and caviar was unique and very fresh tasting.  The bacon gave the shrimp and amazing taste and the papaya mustard added an additional layer of flavor.  The spiciness of the foam with the sea bass was another wonderful flavor pairing.  The Wagyu beef was so tender it almost fell apart on its own yet it was cooked black and blue as I asked.  Finally the candy bar had so many flavors and textures and it was really a playful finishing course for this grand meal.

I did not get the dipping sauces with my steak, but I didn't request them and I didn't care if I had them or not.  I'm normally a steak purist and like steak as it is without anything but salt.

The staff was amazing.  I was served by Team 1.  I had prompt, always attentive service without being annoying.  My iced tea glass was not refilled.  When I neared the end of a glass, a server came by with a fresh glass of iced tea and took the old one.  I didn't need to request a refill--it was just done.  The main server always returned after I had a short time with each course to check if everything was satisfactory.  This is amazing service and the team concept worked just the way they planned.

I liked the room a lot.  It's modern, dimly lit but with small spot lights that light each table so you have a super combination of dim lighting but enough light I didn't need the flash when I took my photos.  I also liked the fact that the bar area with its TV was segregated from the dining areas by a sheer curtain that blocked the bar atmosphere which is just fine with me.

A friend and I went here to enjoy a tasty steak, and that's just what we did.  Since we were there early, we had run of the place.  We took photos of the different booths where Sinatra, Elvis, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Dean Martin dined.  The hostess showed us a side room where she said Tony Spilotro would dine and she had a story about a counter where their guns were placed before they sat down.  When she said that he was there only a month before his body was found in the desert (after he was murdered, he was buried in a field in Indiana), it cast a little doubt on the authenticity of her story.  Enough of that, on to the meal.

We both ordered the 12 ounce filet that their menu refers to as ""the Aristocrat of Tenderness).  I ordered a chopped green salad with Roquefort dressing.  I got the jumbo baked potato that the menu bills as ""Vegas' biggest.""  Finally, we each had some chocolate cake for dessert.

The bread basket was simply some sliced Italian bread--nothing special.  The steaks were wonderful.  Mine was very tender.  I ordered it black and blue and that's almost the way I got it.  It was done a bit more than I prefer.  My friend ordered his well done--he's a Brit--go figure, but he enjoyed his steak, too!

I only got butter with the baked potato and it was swimming in butter.  It was excellent!  My friend got fries which he described as chips as good as you can get in the States and as good as what he gets at home.

We both ordered the chocolate cake.  This was a bit of a disappointment.  It was a bit dry and a bit small.  There was no dollop of whipped cream to dress it up.

The six sliders are made from the following game animals:  alligator, antelope, buffalo, jackalope (rabbit and antelope meat mixed together), rabbit and wild boar.  They come 3 for $16 (must be all one kind of meat) or a sampler platter of all 6 for $30.

Three of us shared the sampler and we each had a taste of all 6 meats.  My rating would be from best to least: Rabbit, wild boar, alligator, antelope, jackalope, and bison.  All had sauces to enhance the flavors of the meat.  For example, the wild boar had red currant jelly and sharp cheddar cheese while alligator had a remoulade sauce and a fried egg.  There was a toothpick to break the yolk and make the alligator meat really flavorful!  The platter also came with some waffle cut sweet potato fries which were really yam fries--not sweet potato.  This was a good choice, and I'm glad Tony and Clint shared the sampler with me.

Service was good, and I had a mug of their on site brewed root beer.  Another great UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) with a nice bunch of people at a good place.

However, when ordering, my server talked me out of the seasonal menu in favor of the same priced Signature tasting menu.  On his recommendation, that's what I ordered.

I was first brought a choice of rolls and some salted, softened butter--the way butter should be served unless requested otherwise.

The first course was a domestic caviar parfait with five levels with a shallot, potato pancake on the bottom and topped with the caviar as well as having a layer of smoked salmon.  A very good beginning.

The second course was a tartare of ahi tuna with Asian pear, pine nuts, and a quail egg mixed together at the table to mix the tuna with the other components.  This was bland.  There was no salt on the table.  The dish could have used some.  This was a bit of a letdown.

Third course was miso-glazed Chilean sea bass with shellfish dumplings.  The sea bass was excellent.  It was cooked perfectly and the miso broth was very good.  The two dumplings were OK.

The fourth course was Mina's famed lobster pot pie.  My server explained how this affected his career and that this was his signature dish.  The top of the pot pie is sliced around the edge and then this cap is removed to reveal the lobster stew inside.  There were chunks of lobster and vegetables such as celery, potato, and carrot.  The dish is a winner.

Next up was the American wagyu beef, three slices of tender beef with a piece of Hudson Valley foie gras and a pinot noir reduction.  There was also a small amount of mashed potatoes and a slice of mushroom.  The beef was good but steak loses something for me when it's sliced like this even though it was rare.  The mashed potatoes were so sparse they could have been left from the plate and not missed.

Finishing the meal was an assortment of sweets for dessert.  The was a chocolate whiskey cake, cocoa nib ice cream, some candied hazelnuts and salted caramel as well as Mina's famous root beer float which had a chocolate straw embedded in sassafras ice cream.  There was also a warm chocolate chip cookie.

Service was excellent.  My server, Alejandro, was a pleasant and polite.  His explanation of the dishes was interesting and his recommendation of the Signature tasting menu was great!  

I was surprised for a tasting menu that there was no amuse-bouche nor any mignardises at the end.  It's not necessary, but you sort of expect it with a tasting menu at a restaurant with this high reputation.

Another time, I'd order the lobster pot pie as the main course and get the whole lobster.  That would be quite the meal!",14,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

When I walked in and saw there was only a chutney bar I didn't mind too much since there were lunch specials and the menu looked intriguing. Since a lot of Indian restaurants here serve North Indian style cuisine it was a nice change of pace to try South Indian style dishes.

There are currently 3 different lunch specials. Quite honestly at the time I didn't know half of the dishes that were listed on it but I got #5 special thali lunch simply because it had the largest number of items. :) The #5 ($7.50) includes rice, chapati, sambar, rasam, porial, kootu, papadum, and dessert. I asked for it to go and it was made in just a few minutes. I also looked up the what each dish was so I could identify them later. :)

Each dish had a distinct flavor and was good with either the rice or the chapati flat bread. I enjoyed the spicy bold kick of the sambar soup, the delicate taste of the kootu lentils, and the mixed vegetable porial was probably my favorite of all the dishes. The rasam soup was a little too sour for my tastes, but that's just me.

Dessert was a delicious sweet mango(?) pudding with very thin, dark noodles. Very unique and the first time I've had this particular dessert!

I also ordered a mango lassi which was a sizeable portion, with rich, tart mango and yogurt flavor.

Sadly I did not receive any papadum (thin crispy lentil wafers) with my order but I was pretty stuffed eating only half of my order anyways so it didn't matter too much.

Today was the first time I bought poke at a store.  Until now, I only had poke when I ate out.  All three of the varieties I bought - wasabi ahi poke, garlic style shrimp poke, and kimchee style poke were excellent!  What a great dinner!!

The staff was very, very pleasant and the young woman who got my order gave me a garlic shrimp to try.  It convinced me to split my 1/2 pound shrimp order into two types.

The price is very reasonable.  Now if it wasn't so far from where I live, I'd stop more often.  Ever think of opening a Summerlin Poke Express?",4,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The savory dishes for the most part were lacking in seasoning.  The presentation is exceptionally good looking and make the food something you want to dig into.  When we got to the chicken, we both mentioned about it needing something even just plain salt.  It wasn't until later that I saw on a table where the artificial sweeteners were, there were also salt and pepper grinders.  Too late.  The chicken and later the angus beef were lacking in seasoning.

Moving past the savory dishes and moving to dessert showed where Eatt shines at the present time.  A favorite of mine was the tiramisu prepared and presented in quite a different manner.  The poached peach with a nougat center and sprinkled with some pistachio pieces and the praline puffs were very well executed and were quite good.

The restaurant has a lot of promise.  The chefs are trying different things and the plating is very successful.  The savories need work with seasoning.

I went for lunch/dinner today after seeing a Facebook post from Moko stating they had curry ramen. I am not a ramen aficionado but I like having soup when it's as cold as it's been the last few days.  

I walked in and the owner, WooSuk, greeted me because I've been there a couple of times.  I sat myself at the bar and the server brought me the menu and the sheet where you check the ramen you want and check off any add ons you wish.  She sensed I was a tenderfoot, so she talked me through the procedure and did the checking off for me.

My order was for curry ramen with an extra of homemade chasu.  While waiting for the ramen, I watched Navy pull away in their football bowl game--Anchors Aweigh, my boys, Anchors Aweigh!

In a short time, WooSuk brought me my bowl of ramen.  The noodles were very hot and the curry had a good spiciness.  Mixed in the soup were some bean spouts, spinach, and scallions.  With the soup, I had a diet Coke.  The soup was very filling and quite tasty!  I need to go back and get the pako with my ramen but the curry is excellent!

The hapu itself was tender, flaky, and perfectly cooked. Unfortunately the breading on it was charred in some areas, causing it to taste bitter. The breading was also very hard texture-wise, making it difficult to eat without giving your jaw a workout. The actual lemongrass sauce was broken when it arrived, creating an unappetizing mixture of runny liquid and coagulated yellow mass. The taste of the sauce, while initially pleasing on the first bite, became harder to eat after successive bites due to the sour flavor of it. The sides for the dish included some slightly undercooked rice and very generic, bland coleslaw.

I also tried some mahi-mahi, which also came with the same rock hard breading, and a similarly sour sauce. The actual fish was delicious though and we peeled apart the breading and pushed aside the sauce to savor the pure taste of the fish.

I also tried some ceviche, which had way too much lime juice in it, overpowering the whole dish. 

The one true highlight of the meal was trying some of the jerk chicken. It was tender, with bold, spicy flavors. 

Service was good for a busy Saturday night. Drinks were refilled as needed.

Overall, the fish dishes need more simplicity in their preparation for the true taste of the fresh, good quality fish gets muddled when it is breaded and doused in a powerfully flavored sauce.

It was late afternoon and much of their sweets were gone except for baqlava, the way it's spelled here.  They sell it by the pound and I asked if I could get a half pound.  The answer was yes and that was what I got.  The half pound came to 6 bite sized cubes of rich pastry topped with pistachio.  The cubes are soft and have a great honey flavor but they are not dripping with honey.  You can pick them up and eat them as they are.  The baqlava are very good.

While waiting, I watched a man making some sangak bread, something of which I'd never heard.  The bread is a long piece of dough--perhaps 3 feet in length with holes in the dough.  The worker was stretching the dough much like pizza dough and then he put it on a griddle to brown.

As I was leaving, a gentleman asked me if I'd ever tried the bread.  When I said no that it was so large for one person, he told me to try it sometime.  Freeze it and then cut off what you want to eat and toast it.  Delicious, he assured me.  Next time when I'm near, I'll stop and get one and I'll take his advice.

I browsed through the menu before deciding on the rustic veggie pizza. The Yelp check-in offer was for a free fountain soda- nice! The grand total was $7.95 pre-tax for my pie, about the same you'd pay at similar personal custom pizza places.

The pizza came out in a few minutes, delivered right to my table. It had a plentiful amount of vegetables such as red and green bell peppers, corn, onion, and aromatics such as garlic and fresh basil. There was a thin layer of tomato sauce and it was topped with mozzarella and ricotta. 

Overall, it was a pretty good pie. The sauce wasn't overpowering and was well balanced against the other ingredients. I liked the thin crispy crust which had a slight amount of chewy give when you bit into it. The vegetables were cooked yet still retained their crispness, to contrast with the creamy texture and slight salinity of the cheese.

JUygwe5d_MXCCOdk0WB30g,11,2014-12-17,11,GLSYQN0w7cob6wTb3zTvyg,4,"Tonight's show was the first public preview show.  The premiere will be this weekend.  The show consists of 19 songs--showstoppers from Broadway musicals--that were evidently chosen by Steve Wynn.  There are 19 songs in all as of this evening.

The show opens with a medley of songs from Hello Dolly and Mame, then Cabaret and finally Chicago.  In between there are some shows that are represented by one song including one called ""Ol' Las Vegas"" a takeoff on the song ""No Name City"" from Paint Your Wagon.

The cast consists of 66 people counting a full orchestra and a large complement of singers and dancers with several lead singers.  The cast is extraordinarily talented.  They sing beautifully and the dancing is done very well.

My favorite numbers for the evening were ""Willkomen"" from Cabaret, ""Cell Block Tango"" from Chicago, ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"" from Gypsy, and the ""Chorus Line/One"" opening number for A Chorus Line.  The solo numbers were absolute standouts including ""All That Jazz"" from Chicago.

A few thoughts on the show.  Note, I am a theatre junkie.  I love all types of theatre, especially Broadway.  While I enjoyed this show a whole lot, it's too short at just about 1 hour and 5 minutes.  I couldn't believe they were doing curtain calls so quickly.  The show started about 5 minutes late--what do they think this is, the Smith Center?  Perhaps the late start was opening night.  Early on, one of the characters introduces a number with some short comments.  After that, a recorded Steve Wynn introduced some sections and individual numbers.  Do we really need a recorded Steve Wynn telling us what ""Razzle Dazzle"" from Chicago is about?  All I could think was, ""Pot, meet kettle.

On the way out, we were handed a survey to help them improve the show.  The last question is ""Would you recommend this show to family, friends, and Las Vegas visitors?""  The possible answers given are:  1) Yes - it's a great show for all; 2) Maybe - depends on whether they like Broadway or not; and 3) No.  And there's the rub.  The show will be liked mostly by people who know and like Broadway.  The show will appeal to the older demographic, certainly not the Tryst nightclub goer.

I hope the show succeeds but I wonder if it can.  Very talented singers and dancers weren't enough to keep Spamalot and Avenue Q in this theatre and there are no bells and whistles like Phantom.  Time will tell.

As a tip, the website did not allow choosing a seat rather you are assigned one.  I'd recommend sitting at least four to five rows from the stage.  If you want to be assured of where you're sitting, I'd call the box office and have the seat map on your computer.",16,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

After checking the menu--it's different than the one online--I ordered a small bowl of Tom Yum soup.  For the main course, I ordered soft shell crab pad pong karee.  I also ordered a Thai iced coffee.  When I was asked for the spiciness of both dishes, I was given a scale of mild, medium, or spicy.  I asked for medium to spicy and the server said I'll put medium ++.  My receipt shows them both as medium.  

Before ordering, I was brought three fried wonton pieces with chile sweet and sour sauce much like noodles in a Chinese restaurant.

The iced coffee and a glass of water and a carafe of water were brought.  There was a fresh rose in a glass on the table.  When my soup came, it was perfect.  The right size for a person dining alone and seasoned spicier than medium but not burn your mouth hot.  The broth was excellent.  The soup was not overwhelmed with lemongrass as some Thai places do.  This was an auspicious start to the evening!

Then the soft shell crab was brought along with a small bowl of rice.  The spiciness of the crab was opposite the soup.  In fact, there was little flavor to the sauce itself.  The flavor of the dish came from the crab and the vegetables in the dish.  On a scale of 1 to 5 for spiciness, this dish was 0. This was a big disappointment!  I should have ordered the duck as I was planning.

I ordered the sweet sensation banana Thai pancake with Thai iced tea ice cream.  The dessert was fine.  The pancake was tough and the ice cream had little taste.  The presentation was excellent with a small square of chocolate with the Arawan logo on it.

Service was excellent and not simply because I was the only person there.  I can see the people giving courteous and friendly service to all customers.  The room is nicely done aand so open compared to the restaurant it replaced.

We had a large party, and the person organizing our get-together tried to call an hour before we arrived to put our name on the list, but no one answered the phone after repeated attempts.  So, when we got here we waited for a bit outside while some tables cleared out.  When we finally got a table, they gave us a table that couldn't seat all of us, for they wrote down the wrong number of people for our party.  

After some more shuffling and rearranging of chairs and tables, we finally got seated.  I tried a sample of the pumpkin porter, and had the portabella-veggie beer bread.  The pumpkin porter was decent, and had a nice pumpkin-spice taste to it.  I wasn't a big fan of the veggie beer bread.  I was expecting more of a loaf-type bread instead of the flatbread that actually came out.  As a result, the dish was more of a wrap than a sandwich.  The interior of the wrap was filled with lots of fresh veggies, but I was hoping to find more portabella mushroom in it.  In addition, the veggies themselves were bland, and so overwhelmingly garlicky that I felt like I could ward vampires away for a mile with my breath.

I haven't been to Twin Creeks for many years, so long it was before the renovation to its current setup.  I came here because some friends had a dining credit from a pull tab winner they had while here.  They mailed it to me from their home so it didn't go to waste.  The credit would have been better used at the Sundance Grill or the Mi Casa Cantina.

I was seated promptly at a high top table that would hold four people and I had a good seat for people watching.  I was asked about bottled/tap water and then delivered the iced tea I wanted.  I had looked at the menu online and I had a question about the TC cilantro marinated rib eye.  Susan, my server, explained that it was marinated 3 hours and wasn't strong with cilantro.  That would have been OK with me if it had been longer and I opted to go with that.  For an appetizer, I ordered the seared foie gras.

After a fair wait, a runner brought the foie gras.  There wasn't much to it, but you get what you pay for.  The foie was OK.  There is a blood orange gastrique on the foie.  It sounded funny but it works.  It's light and doesn't overwhelm the foie.  The sautéed mushrooms with it were good.

Then came the steak.  I knew as soon as I saw it they had overcooked it.  I asked for it cooked blue.  It was black and blue which means they left it on the grill on each side to give it a sear which had the result of cooking the steak too much given its thinness.  I was not going to go through the whole take it back and do another one but cook it less so I just ate what I got.  The steak was poor quality.  I literally had to fight the bone to get some meat from it and I ended up tearing the meat from the bone with a combination right knife with a left hook fork.  I would have gotten the same or better quality if I bought a rib eye at Albertson's and brought for them to cook.  The steak was tougher than the Cubs, too!

Along with the steak, I got the large yam for a side.  That was almost the best part of the meal.  The cinnamon flavored butter and the sweetness of the potato was quite flavorful.

For dessert, I got the crème brûlée which was well done with a good vanilla bean flavor.

fmke0ozj83GAebHEdbnlfw,7,2016-02-26,7,B_HKKu0gHTZM-LAqt2NMDg,2,"Zoe, why does your grilled cheese sandwich taste so bad? There aren't that many ingredients to mess up; It's only cheese and bread with tomato and lettuce! I liked the rye bread and the buttery toasted taste of it, but the cheese itself was less than pleasant. While I enjoyed the pimento which gave it a spicy kick, the actual cheese didn't taste that great. Adding to the cheese problem was the fact that they did not melt the shredded cheese fully, so when I received it, it looked like a pre-chewed, coagulated, half-melted mess. Since it was only half melted it was lukewarm temperature-wise. I don't know about you but I don't know anyone who likes eating less-than-hot grilled cheese sandwiches that look like the aftereffect of a toddler's bad stomach day. I actually scraped all the cheese off the bread and thought it was better eating bread, lettuce, and tomato rather than the original sandwich.

The saving grace was the side and the friendly service. The braised white beans were nicely seasoned with a hint of smokiness and just the right amount of rosemary. The beans themselves were perfectly tender. I also had a hibiscus green iced tea with my order which was refreshing, caffeine free, and had good flavor.

I was torn between giving them a 2 or a 3 star, but the more I think about it, the more I think this is the worst grilled cheese sandwich I've had (The ones I made in my dorm room years ago with Kraft Singles tasted better!). So, I'll have to downgrade.

Edit: So I looked up pimento cheese sandwich online- people really enjoy eating chewed up looking bits of cheese in a sandwich? Regardless, the sandwich still didn't taste great to me even though the texture is supposed to be that way.",12,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I was greeted by one of the staff shortly after walking up to the counter area and asked if I was a first time visitor.  He explained to me where I ordered depending on food or just coffee order.

I looked at the menu for awhile and then placed my order.  Starter was oxtail soup, main dish was their coffee rubbed beef sandwich, and iced coffee for my drink.  Since I wasn't sure if I was going to have dessert or not, I went down the line to pay.  They swiped my credit card and left an open tab so I could add to it later if I did order dessert.

I took my #11 to a high top table on the Fremont Street side and was soon brought my iced tea and silverware.   I took the time waiting for my sandwich to enjoy the interior which is different and pleasant.  The a server brought the soup and the sandwich.

The soup has a Tom Ka broth base and had cherry tomato halves and mushrooms.  The soup had a lot of meat but it was only tepid at best.  It should have been heated much more.  The sandwich was quite good.  Sourdough bread filled with beef and pear-horseradish slaw, it was a tasty and filling sandwich.  The house made potato chips were underwhelming with several stuck together and damp as if something had been spilled on them.

I asked one of the servers if they had a choice of bread pudding or Black Forest which they would recommend.  He said the Black Forest without hesitation.  That's what I ordered and it was excellent.

Sure, I'm not expecting 100% authenticity here since we are on the opposite end of the U.S., but I didn't really see any semblance of NY in this pizza.  In addition, our mushroom pizza hardly had any mushrooms in it, and the ones that were in there were shriveled, small, and hidden inside the pizza- I probably wouldn't have noticed any difference in taste in this mushroom pizza from a regular cheese pizza.

On entering the shop, I bypassed the ""normal"" flavors and went right to the Asian flavors.  I got a 2 scoop lunch, one scoop of durian and one scoop of red bean. The scoops are very generous size portions.   I took the cup outside and sat on the small sidewalk patio with a table and a couple of chairs and enjoyed the ice cream while looking at the mountains on the west side of town.

The durian ice cream was excellent!  It had a good, rich flavor and the ice cream was smooth.  The red bean was not up to the same standard.  There were some ice crystals and it wasn't as smooth as the durian.  Mind you, it was good and I liked the fact that it wasn't as sweet as some red bean treats.

The woman running the shop was very, very pleasant.  I stopped in as I was ready to leave to give her a thumbs up for the ice cream and she was appreciative.  Now I have to return and try the taro and other flavors and perhaps get a pint of durian to bring home.

A couple of things about The Perfect Scoop.  I have driven by here probably 20 times since I read the first review and I would never see the shop.  The back of this strip mall fronts Fort Apache and the entrances to these shops are on the west side hidden from the main street.  If you use the Yelp app, use the mapping feature and it will bring you right where the shop is and you'll see the smiley face toward Fort Apache.  Second, another reviewer mentioned that there's nothing on display.  I thought they were out of many flavors when I first went in and saw the plastic lids that appeared to cover empty spaces.  Then I noticed the woman packing ice cream for another customer and I knew what was going on.  This is a tough one.  I guess the ice cream stays better when it's covered than being left open like at other ice cream/gelato places but it is nice to window shop at an ice cream place, too!

Regardless, this is good ice cream, made in house by people who obviously care about their product, and I am sure I'll be back.  The durian is calling me!",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The Excalibur is dated.  I was surprised by the fact that I didn't dislike it as much as I thought I would.  The place is large and finding the steps to the second floor took me awhile, but once I did it, I was able to get to the second floor showroom easily.

I am always surprised by the large number of people that are in the casino.  Even when the economy was at its lowest, the place always seemed to be busy.

The showroom on the second floor, which is shared  by several productions, is a nice enough room.  The long tables with 8 seats per table can be a little uncomfortable as they have them very close to each other. If the show is good, you don't think of this.

Parking is good in the garage in the back, but it may give you a longer walk to get into the casino.  I generally try to find a surface spot parallel to Trop.

Nestled in the Laguna Village shopping center, it's nice to see another Asian restaurant take over where the previous Szechuan restaurant was. They've remodeled the place, adding color, new seating and tables to create a soothing, contemporary atmosphere with an Asian twist. 

The menu is fairly extensive and has all your stand-by favorites such as pad Thai, drunken noodles, and your various forms of curry. They also have some more unique dishes and chef's specialties. I decided on a more pedestrian entree this visit, settling on the chicken red curry, medium spiciness. I also tried some of the tom yum soup and the holy basil chicken.

The tom yum soup was a delicious pungent mix of spices and flavors. It was a great start to our meal. The red curry sauce had an interesting balance of delicate flavor from the coconut milk, with a strong punch of spice and kick from the curry paste itself, and the chiles used for heat. The spiciness level was a perfect medium- just spicy enough to tingle your palate and tongue, but not so spicy that you'd be in pain afterwards (Or drinking gallons of water!). While I enjoyed the sauce and the vegetables in the dish, the chicken in the entree was overcooked and tasted pretty tough. On the other hand, the holy basil was divine. The chicken was tender, cooked perfectly, with a great mix of veggies and flavors. 

One bowl of rice comes with the entrees, which I appreciated, but I would have liked to see more rice included because the meager portion wasn't enough to eat with the lovely red curry sauce I had.

We ended the meal with some Thai tea creme brulee. It was a unique twist on a French classic, executed wonderfully. I would definitely order it again!

Service was decent, and waters were refilled as needed.

Overall, a pretty satisfying meal. I'd definitely go here again to try more dishes!",3,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The bread was crispy and toasted, with some Dijon mustard, tender ham, melted Swiss cheese, with some melted cheese on top. The combination of flavors and textures was excellent. The French onion soup was served piping hot, with a generous serving of melted cheese on top. The flavors in the soup had a deep, rich beef flavor melded with some sweet caramelized onion.

Closed briefly in 2014, it reopened with new owners and with a revamp of the interior.  It is no longer a tiny, old space but instead has been made into a very pleasant, roomier restaurant.  Still, it has about 15 tables so it's not a giant place.

Prior to a show not too far away, I came here for dinner having read the reviews on Yelp.  I was the only person in the restaurant which factors into the amount of stars I've given El Sombrero.  

I ordered the soup of the day which was chicken tortilla soup.  For a main course, I ordered the tamal de carne, stuffed with braised marinated brisket in a homemade tamal steamed in a banana leaf.  In addition, I ordered a side of their Mexican cream corn.  Later, for dessert I got the Mexican bread pudding.

I was brought the soup and it was excellent!  However, this is where the loss of a star comes into play.  I had the soup for about 4 minutes when two servers appeared with the tamal, the cream corn, and the rice and beans.  Since I was the only person in the restaurant, there was no hurry to get dishes out and the servers should have known this. 

I hurried to finish my soup so I could get to the tamal before it cooled.  The Mexican cream corn was a take on Mexican street corn but after grilling, the corn is cut off the cob, mixed with crema, and topped with cheese.  It was good but with the rice and beans, I wouldn't order it again.  The seasoning of the different parts of the meal was good.

So, we took a cozy little corner booth since we were at a Curry Corner. It took some time for a server to come by, and we ordered a wrap and the vegetable thali. After another stretch of time the server came by again saying they didn't have the wraps available today. So, the chicken keema ended up being the alternative choice. 

It took a loooong time for our meals to get served to us, but they did look delectable. My vegetable thali plate had lentil/dal, spinach/palak, vegetable handi, chikpeas/chole, with a generous heap of rice and a piece of freshly baked naan. I enjoyed all the dishes on my plate and the naan was a good balance of crisp outer layer with soft inner portion. The rice was well cooked, nice and fluffy. I also had a bite of the chicken keema which seemed a bit bland to me. 

I had asked for a soda but since service was nearly non-existent and I was doubting I would even get any refills if I had gotten my drink we asked them to take it off our bill once we went up to the register to pay.

We ordered an array of tapas (Typically around $6-10 per order) and the Paella Valenciana (About $20 per person). I enjoyed the cured meats (Chorizo, jamon Serrano), the potato dish (Tortilla de Patatas), and the garlic chicken (Pollo a la Cazadora). The clam and asparagus tapas we ordered (Txirlas a la Koskera) had a light sauce but there was a considerable amount of grit in some clams that we ate. One had so much grit I could hear the crunch when my friend chewed! The white asparagus was tender but very vinegary in stark contrast to the very light tasting sauce.

The paella was beautifully presented and had some of the flavor of a typical paella, but I wasn't impressed with the actual execution. It was served in a paella pan, but the rice was all the same texture and had a lot of liquid in it. It didn't have any of the socarrat, i.e., the caramelized crispy rice on the bottom that paellas typically have. Since there were clams in it apparently the grit from the clams dispersed itself into the sauce because there were some bites where I felt like I was eating sandy rice. As with the clam tapas dish, quite a few of the clams I chewed on had a substantial amount of sand in it (So much that I had to spit some of them out). The rest of the seafood was unremarkable, as the shrimp was overcooked and tough, and the mussels were mushy tasting. 

The best parts of the paella were the small Spanish sausage chunks in it (Txistorra sausage). It had a piquant bold taste that was unique and went great with the rice.

Dessert was one of the highlights of the meal. We shared some churros, apple-banana bread pudding (Pastel de Pan, $6), and a special coconut ice cream in a young coconut shell ($12). The churros had a crispy shell with a molten creamy center, and was served with a dark chocolate dip. The bread pudding was decent, but the caramelized sauce of the pudding masked a lot of the taste of banana or apple. The coconut ice cream was probably my favorite dessert, as it was rich, creamy, and a very sizable portion to share.

Although the ambiance can't be beat, I'm not sure I'd come here again for paella or for any of their seafood. I would possibly come here again for some tapas and/or dessert.",6,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The buttermilk breading was just the right amount of crispiness and had a great flavor to complement the delicate taste of the catfish.  The fish itself, was some of the best I've had.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.

The chicken fried steak was very good, with tender pounded beef and crispy breading.  There were 2 giant pieces on the platter, and it was topped with a generous amount of gravy.  

As for sides, you have your choice of salad or coleslaw, and mashed potatoes or Texas fries.  I had some salad, which wasn't too impressive since it tasted like someone had made it way in advance, making it taste soggy and wilted.  The coleslaw was decent, in a mayo-based sauce that was tangy and sweet.  The mashed potatoes were a hearty portion of skin-on mash.

Turns out the name Ramen Dozo is a bit of a misnomer since this restaurant is more of an all purpose Japanese restaurant that has ramen in addition to sushi, donburi, and plate dishes. When I flipped through the menu I couldn't actually find any ramen until I looked towards the back! 

We came during happy hour and indulged in some discounted rolls, appetizers, and I had a little of the tonkatsu ramen. Our appetizers were the jellyfish salad and hot stone dish. The jellyfish had the requisite chewy texture and was served with some cool refreshing cucumber. The marinade went well with both the jellyfish and the vegetable. The hot stone was a shitake mushroom topped with spicy tuna and crab, deep fried. Overall it was decent but the taste of the spicy tuna had an overpowering acidic flavor that some sweeter sauce on top (Maybe teriyaki or yuzu) would have made it taste more balanced. 

I ordered the spicy tuna roll and yam avocado roll. They were pretty small pieces but for happy hour prices I didn't mind. The rice was cooked well, and out of the two I liked the yam roll better due the slight crunchiness from the deep fried tempura yam contrasting with the creamy cool avocado​. The spicy tuna roll had the same issue as the hot stone. The tuna had too much acidic (Vinegar?) flavor for me to enjoy the dish as a whole. 

The ramen was a good portion, with al dente noodles, the wavy kind vs. Tampopo's straight thin noodles. The broth tasted pretty light (I think my favorite broth is still from Tampopo in the East Valley) but the pork was very tender and packed with a lot of flavor.

Service was slow initially but picked up later on. Our server was very sweet and friendly.

Load up on your Lipitor, check your blood sugar level at the door, and sit down for some Southern style good eats.  We had various sides to go with our fried chicken, such as buttered grits, waffles, collard greens, and beans with rice.

The fried chicken had a salty, crispy, peppery crust with tender, juicy chicken.  I had a 3 piece platter which included a wing, breast, and thigh.  The chicken tasted great with the waffles in maple syrup and butter.  The collard greens were tender, with good smokey flavor and a hint of bitterness from the natural flavor of the greens.  The red beans and rice were decent, and the buttered grits were also decent.

As for drinks, I opted to wash my meal down with some sweet tea ($3).  The tea is very sweet and concentrated, but was tasty nonetheless.  Since it was so sweet, I could only take a few sips of it throughout the meal.  I also tried some red Kool-Aid, which was equally as potent.  If you like strong flavored drinks, this is your place!

Service was very friendly.  It was fairly busy on a Friday night and we had a little bit of a wait, but we didn't mind since it gave us time to look over the menu.  

If I ever have room in my stomach for more food after my main course, I'd definitely like to try some of their delicious desserts!",6,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We ordered their beer cakes, funfetti pancakes, the Ultimate pancake, Monte Cristo French toast, chocolate mocha waffle, banana nut French toast, and one mint chocolate pancake to give the flavor a try.

My favorite of the group was the chocolate mocha waffle.  Next I would put the Monte Cristo French toast and followed closely by the banana nut French toast.  I tasted some of the other cakes, too, except the beer cakes.  For the most part, they each had some sort of hook to make them different and appeal especially to the younger set.

Service was not good.  Coffee was not refilled in a timely manner, the one stack of pancakes was not topped with the yogurt the menu promises, and we were brought a wrong pancakes instead of the French toast we ordered.

We went in late afternoon and were seated immediately--there were only two other tables occupied.  Our server was Allen and he was very good about answering questions.  He first found out we were first timers, so he was eager to help.

I ordered the Black and green burger, a burger made from American wagyu with mushrooms, spinach, bacon, bleu cheese and garlic.  I thought my wife would get a plain burger with cheese but she surprised me by wanting the Kiki burger.  We also got an order of salt and pepper garlic fries.

The burgers were fantastic!  We each enjoyed what we had ordered.  The burgers were very juicy and I love the soft buns they make fresh daily.  The fires were good but I didn't taste any garlic.  They were salted nicely and they had a couple of thin jalapeño slices which was nice.

It came time for dessert and we had decided we'd have the tasting of three flavors of ice cream sandwiches.  It turned out that they had sold the last ones the night before.  I asked if the molten chocolate cake actually took 20 minutes and Allen confirmed this.  We had no place to go so we decided to order the cake and just wait.  After about 20 minutes, one of the chef's came to the table with our dessert and apologized for the way it looked, assured us it would taste a lot better than it looked, and told us it would be no charge.  Something had gone awry and the cake just didn't hold its form and it looked a bit flattened.  He was correct--it was delicious.  I still want to go back and try the triple flavors ice cream sandwiches and I need to try their salted caramel, toasted marshmallow shake.

When we left, Andrea said to me that we should go there once a week.  I said no.  Maybe once a month or so but there are so many good places to try.  I really liked Bachi!",6,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I had the lunch portion of herb crusted salmon and a carrot cake cheesecake. The lunch portion was huge. The salmon was tender, the asparagus was cooked al dente, and the mashed potatoes were creamy with some lumps of potato and some skin. My meal also came with a foil wrapped portion of bread with several pats of butter- nice! The cheesecake was your typical Cheesecake Factory quality. It was creamy, a good amount of sweetness, with a nice integration of carrot cake and cheesecake.

There are two main exhibit halls, one housing the permanent displays and one with rotating exhibits.  There is so much more room for the things the museum owns that can now displayed that wouldn't fit in the old building.

There are many audio and video things to look at, there is information about Nevada mining, and you can find out who Emma Nevada was.

In the rotating exhibit area, there was an HD photo display by Cameron Grant called ""Unexpected Nevada.""  His photos are stunning and it's worth visiting just to see this.

There is a room for visiting school kids, there's a research room, a new gift shop, and a room for presentations with a wonderful patio outside that has a terrific view of the resort corridor.  You can also look down into the animal habitat of the Springs Preserve.

ruWTngdiC68O9la27hvvHw,9,2014-08-26,7,b6IqyVk64VxrHUemQhe4ug,4,"*** Review for Restaurant Week August 2014 Menu ***

The Foundation Room has been a place I've wanted to try for awhile and when I saw it on the Restaurant Week listing, I made my reservation for 6 PM.  While the elevator indicates it's on the 63rd floor, it's actually on the 53rd because this hotel does not use floors numbered in the 40s because of the superstitions of some Asian gamblers.

Greeted at the podium, I was told to go to the bar area and they'd come and get me when ready.  I took the time to explore the bar area and its eclectic mix of art.  It's really fascinating, funny, and very comfortable.  I also went out on the terrace to enjoy that marvelous view of the Las Vegas Strip looking north.  Soon the hostess came and got me and led me to my table on the west side of the room.  She gave me the option of sitting nearer the terrace windows but I was fine where she first took me.  Since the sun was still up, the shades were drawn but I still could see the peaks at Red Rock Canyon and Mount Potosi.  Later, the shades were raised for a great evening view.  On to the food.

Bread service was a nice basket and it was accompanied by a tray holding three dishes, one with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, one with garlic hummus, and one with sweet butter.  The hummus was great.  I'd rather have salted butter and there was no salt on the table.  I'll bring a fast food packet(s) with me in the future.

It's really a four course RW meal.  Everyone gets a Foundation Room salad with red wine vinaigrette dressing, teardrop tomatoes, and pine nut brittle.  The pine nut brittle sweetness was a nice counter to the tart vinaigrette.

Next, I chose the chicken tikka skewers served with pineapple ghost chili jam.  The chicken was marinated in yogurt and curry.  The chicken was marvelous with a great spice flavor and the jam was extra spicy which gave this appetizer a real zing to the beginning of the meal.

For the main course, I got shrimp and grits.  The shrimp was served with a chipotle sauce, again spicy and wonderful, and there were jalapeño rings with the dish.  The grits were very good.  This was another winner!

For dessert, I chose the molten chocolate cake.  It took awhile to make but that was OK.  More time to enjoy the view.  When the cake came, it was accompanied by some vanilla bean ice cream with fresh raspberries and two chocolate truffles.  There was little molten to the cake but it was good.  The ice cream was very good and the chocolate truffles were, too!

Service throughout the evening was good.  I was surprised that both a busser and the server left my empty Sweet 'n Low packet on the table but other than that, service was attentive.  

This was an excellent Restaurant Week pick!",16,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,12,2015-10-06,11,u9cBbrXO_sd6WeVEEWRmHg,3,"Four of us met for late breakfast/early lunch items.  We ordered:

Eggplant Benny
French toast
House stack pancakes
Fried ravioli with marinara
Lasagna
Basilico pizza with artichoke
Panetti breads and marinara
Cannoli

I used to go to the Bootlegger as a tourist when it was at its previous location of Trop and Eastern.  This was the second time I've been to this location.

Meeting at 10:30 so we could try some breakfast items before breakfast service starts, the best of the three items we tried was the eggplant Benny.  This was a unique take on eggs Benedict with the base being eggplant.  I am not a big pancake person but I did try some of this and found it to be light and of good flavor especially with the imported (from the Northeast) pure maple syrup one of the group carries with them for breakfasts just in case a place serves syrup made by someone's aunt.

Of the lunch dishes we ordered, the ravioli were very good.  The menu says it's a light breading and it was.  The pizza with artichoke was adequate.  The crust was not crisp but this is their style.

For dessert, the cannoli were standard except for the fact that they had and orange zest flavor to the filling which unusual to find at most Italian restaurants.  It gave a fresh taste to some rather standard, crispy shell cannoli.

The panetti breads with marinara was a bit of a disappointment for me.  They were too doughy for my taste.

This is a solid place for either breakfast or lunch although I'd go for lunch more than the breakfast selections.  It's a 24 hour place with video poker at the bar and it's a step up from the normal 24 hour places that dot the Las Vegas Valley.",17,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Bing soo, coffee, AND shakes? I'm in heaven and it's raining Korean style snow! We were looking for a place to have a cool refreshing dessert and someone didn't want bubble tea (Hint, it's not me ;p) so Ice Lab was a good compromise. The shop is a couple doors down from Asian Cafe Express and is hard to miss since it has a blindingly bright white interior inside with a brightly lit sign outside. 

All the selections sounded so delectable but I was set on having something with snow and some coffee. I saw that they offered affogato so naturally I had to order it :). I'm always a sucker for green tea dessert so I went with the green tea snow.

It was a bit mesmerizing watching the gentleman at the counter making the snow. He rotates it around and then adds the green tea sauce in layers, along with some cereal and shaved almonds to make sure there is a bit of delicious lightly crunchy hidden dessert treasure in each bite you take into your colorful sweet avalanche. I was a bit skeptical at the use of Frosted Flakes around the sides and inside the snow but it worked out as a nice textural component while also adding a little punch of sweetness to the creamy snow and green tea flavor. The almonds were a great mix in as well, providing a bit of nutty flavor and light delicate crunch. 

The snow itself was very light and fluffy. We had no problem finishing that dessert!

I also enjoyed the affogato. The espresso was strong and smooth, and the gelato was rich, thick and creamy, a perfect counterpoint to the espresso. 

The gentleman at the counter was friendly and delivered our shake and affogato right to our table.

I was immediately taken by the change in customer service when I arrived.  The hostess asked me if I wanted a table or booth.  Both of these seat 4 people.  I glanced toward the small bar area and saw small, high top bar tables, and I asked if I could sit there because I was alone.  I was told I could wherever I wanted and she escorted me to a table there.  There is a high cushioned bench running along the wall.  Once you get up on the bench, there's a raised platform for your feet so you can be very comfortable at these tables.

Tami, the bartender, took my order and checked on me after every course was delivered to see if there was anything she could do and to see if I was satisfied with my meal. 

When ordering, I asked if the soups were cups or bowls.  Being told they were bowls, Tami then said, ""But we can do a cup of soup for you.""  I ordered the Italian wedding soup that I haven't had in a long time.  For the main course, I chose the veal picatta.   And, they give you choice.  You don't have to take pasta with every entree.  I opted for vegetables that included some roasted potatoes.  That's what I mean by the change in customer service.

Dessert was a tough one.  There were so many choices I wanted to stay for a few desserts. I decided on the classic mud pie, and it was great!  Cookie crumb crust, at least 3 inches high with coffee ice cream, drizzled with chocolate, and accompanied with some fresh strawberries and a raspberry and blueberry.

We had tickets towards the back (Row 23) and had no problems seeing the stage from where we were sitting due to the stadium-style seating. Acoustics were overall good and the show we saw was awesome (The Book of Mormon). 

I got an email a few days prior warning us about the popularity of the show making it potentially hard to find parking. So, we got here an hour before the show started like the email recommended and were pleasantly surprised to find parking closest to the theater in Gammage lot 3. I'm not sure if it's because we saw a matinee instead of an evening show since I was half expecting the lot to be full already based on what the email said.

If you arrive early like we did they do have a bar and a few snack booths selling pastries, candy, sandwiches, salads, chips, and various beverages. Prices are on par with how much you'd probably pay at a movie theater for similar snacks. 

Another perk of seeing a show at Gammage is that you can get 4 free hours of parking at the US Airways and City Hall garages if you show your ticket according to the Gammage website so you can browse around Mill/downtown Tempe afterwards if you'd like. Gammage also has a partnership with several restaurants in the area where you can get a discount or a free item if you show your ticket. Some restaurants I remember seeing were Chompies, Rula Bula and Cafe Boa. The full list is here:

While entering the parking lot was easy , getting out of the lot was another matter. It was total chaos and the parking lot attendants didn't seem prepared since all the exits weren't opened up when we were trying to leave, creating a bottleneck as cars came from every direction trying to exit from one spot. When they finally did open up the other exit it created even more chaos as cars waiting in the previous line tried to worm their way to the other exit.

I've been here twice so far. The first time, I needed to get some supplies from Korea Mart and used that as the perfect excuse to get a bubble tea from Boba Tree to sip on my way there. The menu has a wide range of various teas and mix ins. Some of the items aren't very self explanatory. For instance, what makes a ""magic milk tea"" so magical? Turns out, it is coffee jelly! In general a few more descriptions on the menu would help.

I got the ""fancy milk tea"" since it had pudding, ""herbal"" mix in (I think it is grass jelly) and boba in it (Plus I got to be fancy). The tea was made in a few short minutes and I was on my way! I loved the milk tea. It had the perfect balance of tea flavor and creaminess from the milk. The boba was soft, with just the right amount of chewy springiness. The pudding was also perfection, solid enough not to dissolve in the drink but soft enough to be easily sucked up with the boba straw. I was sad to discover after the fact that I did not get the herbal mix in, I would have loved the extra topping in my drink.

On my second visit I was intrigued by the ""cheese"" drinks (AKA salted cream drink), so I got the cheese Gyokuro green tea with boba. The cream was thick and rich, a little reminiscent of cheese in that it was very creamy and a little tangy. I really enjoyed the refreshing, perfectly brewed Gyokuro green tea. I tried a little of the lemon milk with coconut jelly too which was made with fresh lemons and had an assertive tart taste balanced with the creamy milk and sweet jelly. 

Note that to use credit card you need a minimum purchase of $10.

They don't have the clear plastic heat-sealed lids for their drinks but each drink is hand shaken with ice before being placed in the cup.

2PCmdNMtG3zLp7dBH4Gxfg,36,2017-06-17,22,0VhFQx2VscWcuK3efuaoIg,4,"Brand new seafood spot! I was excited to see that this restaurant had opened up in the AZ International Market plaza. I remember seeing the LA Crab Shack sign above the restaurant when the grocery store opened up but since there were no occupants at the time I wasn't sure if it was an old sign and the business left, or if it was a business to open in the future. Now I know it's the latter!

The menu is very similar to Hot n Juicy Crawfish and Angry Crab Shack. They offer different varieties of seafood by the pound with your choice of sauce and heat level. Oysters, fried baskets, gumbo, and po' boys are also on the menu. We had a group of 6 and we ended up splitting a dozen char-grilled oysters, 2 pounds each of shrimp and snow crab legs and had the Crab Shack blend, lemon pepper, and garlic butter sauce with them.

The oysters came out first. Compared to char grilled oysters I've had in New Orleans, these were all-around a lighter presentation as they were lightly cooked, seasoned, and had a light smoke/grilled flavor. Overall they were decent, but I do prefer the bolder flavors of the ones I've had in New Orleans better. Although we ordered a dozen oysters we only received 11 of them. Someone needs to learn how to count!

The seafood came piping hot in clear plastic bags. My favorite sauce was the Crab Shack blend, a mix of the Ragin' Cajun, lemon pepper, and garlic butter sauce. At medium heat it still had a bit of bite, but more on the lower end of the heat spectrum for me. Out of the two remaining non-blended sauces I preferred the garlic butter over the lemon pepper since the latter only had dry seasoning on the steamed crab which made it hard to taste the flavor once the shells were cracked open. We did order two sides of sausage which were placed in each of the bags and the lemon pepper tasted odd with the smoked sausage flavor but went well with the other sauces.

Service was friendly and attentive. The manager came by to make sure we were having a good time and let us know to tell him if there are any improvements to make since they just opened.

Since you will inevitably be a briny, oily, spicy dribbling mess (Even with the bib) after you eat they do have a washing station right outside the restrooms.

We ordered 4 lbs. of food + oysters and 2 orders of sausage for essentially 5 people (One person had primarily a po' boy) and we all still felt hungry (But for something non-seafood like) after our seafood bonanza so I'd order more than what we did if you want to walk out of here feeling full.

The only other criticism is I wish the tables were a little bigger so it's easier to share your seafood bounty with your party. It wasn't overly cramped but it did become hard to find a place for the paper towel roll, two buckets of discards, a platter of oysters, and 3 bags of seafood.

Overall we all had a good time and I'd love to come back again to gorge on more seafood!",39,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

This was the last of my Restaurant Week visits.  I have been intrigued when I've walked by Beijing Noodle No. 9 and seen the whiteness of the interior.  It does grab your attention.  Aside from that, I wanted to try their noodles.

This was a four course meal.  For the starter I chose the tomato and egg drop soup.  I haven't seen this combination and it works well.  The tomatoes were partially blanched so they had texture to them and weren't mushy.  The soup was very hot and tasty.

For an appetizer, I chose the spring rolls.  It was three fried rolls with sweet and sour sauce.  They were standard egg rolls.

For the main course, I got the Sichuan Dan Dan noodles.  These are hand pulled noodles with chili oil and minced pork and scallions.  It was very good.  The spiciness was good, but I chose to add a little extra from the small container on each table. 

The menu said dessert was a mochi sampler.  It was two pieces of chocolate mochi with raspberry sauce.

Serviced was very good.  The courses were spaced nicely and my iced tea was refilled without asking.

I sat at the sushi bar and almost immediately Freda, one of the sushi chefs, started to ask me questions and to suggest things.  I ordered the first three nigiri selections and then he made some recommendations from there.  Throughout my dinner, he was very helpful and very pleasant!

Here's a list of what I had.  All are nigiri except where noted:

Garlic tuna
Hamachi
Octopus
Conch
Cajun tuna
Masago jalapeño (forgot the quail egg, Paolo, but I'll remember next time.
Crab (snow) meat
Sweet shrimp 
Salmon belly
Spicy shrimp and Scallop yum yum hand rolls
Cold tofu with 3 condiments
Grilled salmon and grilled white tuna
Green tea crème brulée
Green tea cake
Chocolate mousse
Tempura ice cream

Chef Freda saw how much I enjoyed the grilled white tuna so he made me the sushi version of it nigiri style.

Service was great.  I felt very comfortable for my first time here, and I started to learn more about how to order and what to look for.  I also took his suggestions several times especially when he recommended the heads be removed from my sweet shrimp nigiri and then eaten in the soup they make.  The shrimp heads and soup were superb!",4,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Since it was Sunday, they had a brunch menu but neither of us were interested in that.  Immediately after being seated, we were asked about drinks and two iced teas were brought quickly.  

After looking at the menu for awhile, my wife opted not to have the fajitas for two but ordered the chicken azado Vallarta style--salsa Española with capers, banana peppers, and olives.  I ordered the flaming fajitas.  After all, it's the name of the place and that's why I stopped.

We were brought chips, salsa, bean dip, and a small dish of grilled onions and one half of a grilled jalapeño.  Standard fare except for the grilled onions and jalapeño.  

In a short time, our dinners arrived.  Mine was flamed near the table but far enough away for safety.  The fajita pan is a high pan with a circular top.  The chicken, peppers, and onions were nicely grilled and the flavors were very good.

My wife's chicken was good, and it was a very large portion.  I have leftovers for dinner this evening.  It was one whole chicken breast.

Not finishing her meal allows my wife to justify dessert.  I need no justification.  We shared an order of fried ice cream that was very good.  The crust on the outside was tasty and the ice cream was nice to have on one of our 100 degree summer days.

Service was excellent.  Multiple people came to check on iced tea refills, was it OK to remove dishes, anything else, etc.  One of the managers (owners?) came by and chatted and made sure all was well.  He asked if it was our first time at the restaurant.  He explained some of their current promotions.

I normally would have given Juan's a 3 star rating.  However, the service and the appreciation shown for patronizing Juan's figured in my upping the review to 4 stars.  I appreciate when businesses give good service and are glad that you stopped there given all the choices we have in this city.  I am a fan!",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We always overlook going to Nove because of its out of the way location so it was on our must try list and was it a good decision.

We were brought iced teas quickly and they were refilled often during the night.  Then came bread service.  It was three kinds--cheese bread sticks, focaccia, and Italian bread.  We also got a dish with three potential bread toppings and for use during the meal--one container with olive oil, one with red pepper flakes, and one with grated cheese.

One of the runners brought us an amuse-bouche--two small bruschetta with freshly chopped tomatoes.  A nice palate awakener for what was to come.

For a starter, we order their salumi plate.  Our server, Alex, assured us it could be shared by two people.  The menu said that it was a selection of cured meats and red pizza.  Well, that sounded fine.  What came was almost a meal in itself.  Four kinds of cured meat, parmigiano cheese, and some fresh ricotta.  That wooden server was placed in front of us and then they placed a wood plate with red pizza.  Wow!  So much!  

Cured meat platter:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#rfBs4_87H9DVi5r3o0E_9A

Red Pizza:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#a_Kw4-9-qjX9ROujm1IhHg

We also had another three compartment dish with mustard, olives, and pickled vegetables.  This was really starting to add up in the stomach and we hadn't gotten to the main course.  Everything was excellent.  We had to let two small pieces of pizza go back with the dishes.

For the main course, my wife got the Veal Nove which the menu describes as thinly sliced Scaloppine, Prosciutto, Arugula, and Lemon.  I tried a small piece and it was very, very good.  I ordered a special--lobster ravioli with a seafood sauce similar to lobster bisque.  It was superb!  There was a small amount of veal leftover and Alex and his crew quickly boxed it for bringing home.

Now comes my pastry chef experience.  One of their desserts is Make Your Own Cannoli.  You get 5 small sized shells, a small, plastic pastry bag filled with the luscious cream that goes inside the cannoli, and a dish with nine compartments for dipping the ends of the cannoli.  The compartments had raspberry sauce, chocolate syrup, chocolate chips, coconut, butterscotch, toffee, pistachio, and chopped peanuts.  If you're counting and only got 8, it's because two of the wells had raspberry syrup.

Like my Yelp friends who work at Jean Philippe at Aria, I wielded that pastry bag like a surgeon uses his scalpel.  In no time whatsoever, I had completed my first cannoli with one side dipped in raspberry.

My wife, who hasn't been a fan of cannoli before tonight, ate three of them which left me with just two and I did all the work myself.  That's gratitude I'll tell you.  That dessert was fun and it's a clever menu item!

Service was excellent!  Alex and crew were always there to help, removed dirty plates, chat a bit, and do everything as well as they could which was very good!

The view, while not as good as Alizé, is not bad.  I had a view of the original Palms Tower and being a local, I was studying the streets to figure out where the things in the area I know were located.

I was brought an iced tea as I was reading the menu.  Being a lone diner in a tapas place can be problematic but my server was good at letting me know if I'd be overdoing anything with my order.

I ordered the Drunken avocado Empanadillas for a starter and shawarma for the main course.  There were two sides and from the list the server said, I chose the grilled vegetables and Spanish rice.  For dessert, I got their key lime dessert--key lime served in a champagne glass with pastry crumbs in the bottom of the glass.

I enjoyed the lea very much.  The drunken avocado is such a simple yet creative idea.  There could be a bit more jalapeño sauce but I enjoyed the soft avocado against the crispy wrapping.  An avocado spring roll as it were.

The shawarma was very nicely seasoned and tasty.  The sides were good.   The Spanish rice was OK--rice isn't one of my go to sides--but the grilled vegetables were excellent.  A mixture of sliced yellow and green squash, some onions, and some red and yellow peppers.  I didn't realize until I got home that even though I was told it was one of the sides from which I had a choice of two, there was a $2 surcharge on the bill for the vegetables.

There is a chalkboard near the podium when you walk in that has desserts listed.  There were only two and the server went to make sure of what they had.  I got the key lime dessert and it was quite good.

I enjoyed my meal and the service.  My iced tea was always full.  Service was excellent! 

This was something completely new for me and a good find thanks to Groupon.  It's a bit pricey without the Groupon.",21,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
tCkjFVOL2Crz44D8_FDozg,2,2013-06-23,1,LQK4EukYlIOyItNjX2s6Mg,4,"The lunch specials here are a steal. For $7 you get a hefty sized main course, 1 side, and a soda or tea. They have a good selection of items, such as various sandwiches (e.g., pulled pork, dipped beef, fried fish), quesadillas, or an all-you-can-eat soup and salad meal. 

We arrived here on a Sunday where they have all day happy hour which includes appetizers for $5.50 as well as discounted drinks. We decided on the jambalaya spring rolls, and the bearded dragon wings. The jambalaya spring rolls came out sliced long-wise, which was pretty unusual, but worked out well since you could taste more of the crispy egg roll skin more in each bite. The filling itself was good, but there was mostly shredded chicken and cheese with a few chunks of Andouille sausage. The shredded chicken and cheese itself didn't add a lot of texture to the appetizer and made it a little mushy tasting on the inside. The dip that went with the spring rolls was decent, but very sweet. We started dipping the rolls in our leftover bearded dragon sauce and they actually ended up tasting better together than with the sweet Ho-chi sauce.

The bearded dragon wings were very good. The wings had a nice crisp crust, covered in a hot wing type sauce with a hint of sweetness. 

We decided on the freedom dip and pulled pork sandwich lunch specials. The freedom dip had nice, tender slices of beef with melted cheese and crusty French, er, Freedom bread. The dipping sauce was good, not too salty. The pulled pork sandwich was a hefty portion of pork, with smokey slow-roasted flavor. It had just the right amount of bbq sauce and a generous portion of tangy crispy coleslaw. 

Service was cheerful and friendly. Drinks were refilled as needed. 

We came in with a Groupon, and the only thing to note is that if you order the lunch specials, the $7 deal won't count totally towards the Groupon. If you use it, they will add the drink separately to make it ""un-special"" since daily specials won't count towards your purchase. Still, we got a good deal regardless. Our total without the Groupon was a little over $26 including tax for 2 appetizers, 2 meals, and 2 drinks. 

I probably wouldn't have eaten here if it weren't for the Groupon, but now that I've seen that you get a really good deal for the portions and quality of food you get, I'm definitely going to make more visits to Iguana Mack's! They also have a dog friendly patio, which will be perfect for outings with the dogs!",5,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The restaurant was almost empty when I arrived at 12:30.  Service was excellent and I know it would have been even if there were a lot of people there.

While I was looking the buffet over, the waiter brought me an iced tea as requested.  Shortly after returning to the table, another server brought me a basket of fresh naan.

Here's what I tried:

Vegetable pakora - good but not a lot of spice
goat curry - nice spice and very tasty
saag paneer with cheese - flavorful with a nice zing
basmati rice - standard
naan - plain and good
chana masala - excellent with a nice spiciness
bhindi masala - this was noted as a house favorite.  I didn't think there was anything special about the okra nor the potatoes and it lacked much flavor
navratan lorna - good
karahi lamb - nice flavor and good spice
chicken tikka masala - excellent
ras malai - excellent sweet to end this feast

Lest you worry that I cleaned the place out, let me assure you I didn't.  I took small portions of all these things just to try them.  Since I was alone, I had a great time watching the Bollywood Bang-Bang music videos on their TV screens.

I was excited to see the sign go up a few weeks ago so when I drove by today and saw the open sign I knew I had to try it out! The menu is similar to Ahipoki Bowl but I think they offer a better deal here since they do not charge extra for yellowtail.

The soft opening special was a great deal, $6 for a regular bowl which includes two scoops of your choice of seafood with a plethora of toppings. For your base, they offer white rice, brown rice, wonton strips, or salad, with a choice to have half and half in your bowl if you'd like. Choices for seafood include tuna, salmon, scallops, shrimp, octopus, and yellowtail. 

I decided on a regular bowl with salmon, yellowtail, with a half salad half brown rice base. I had it with the ponzu sauce and overloaded on the toppings (Jalapeno, crab salad, edamame, cucumber, pickled cucumber, red onion, pickled cucumber, picked radish, masago, seaweed strips, sesame seeds, mango, wasabi, green onion and fried onion). They were very generous with the toppings and I loved the freshness of the seafood and mix ins, combination of flavors and the kaleidoscope of colors in my bowl. I especially enjoyed the fresh mango pieces with my bowl. 

If you get the combo it's an extra $2.50 and includes a drink and miso soup. The soda fountain has iced tea and Coke products. The miso soup was pretty basic and had a light taste.

This seems like a more independent, family-run business than Ahipoki and service was so friendly and sweet. We even got a free sample of some delicious fried gyoza! 

I go to the Smart and Final in the same plaza quite a lot so I foresee being one of their regular customers. Thanks Pokedon, for a great experience!",47,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I ordered the omelette with home fries and rye toast.  The omelette was a nice size.  It was filled with the lobster and cheese sauce.  There were some larger pieces of lobster, but most were small pieces.  That didn't detract.  One wouldn't expect a lobster tail in an omelette.  The home fries were very tasty.  Good sized chunks of browned potatoes.  And the rye toast was swirled rye.

Two people, a man and a woman, took orders and brought dishes to the table.  Both were very pleasant and very efficient.  

I was so glad they did the Groupon because I never knew this place existed.  Now that I'm a fan, I'll come back and try some other things.

As others have said, the place is a small, cozy restaurant.  I sat in the back area by the coffee counter where they have just 3 tables.

It was the service that was somewhat off.  I decided before I went to try the signature tasting menu--four courses with choices in each section.  

First course was a choice of a salad or Castilian soup.  I ordered the soup.  My server came back in a short time to tell me they no longer have that soup, and she showed me a menu from which I could choose from three different dishes.  I opted for the Lobster gazpacho.  The server then said, ""You know that's cold, don't you?""  Do I look that much like a rube? (that's rhetorical!)  The gazpacho was excellent.  Great tomato flavor and there were several pieces of tasty lobster.

Course two was the creamy risotto with wild mushrooms and manchego cheese.  The risotto was very flavorful and very enjoyable!

For the third course, I chose the Crispy chicken breast roulada with sautéed potatoes, pork chorizo, and roasted red pepper.  Very tasty!

Finally, I was allowed to order anything off their dessert menu rather than choose from the two choices on the tasting menu.  I chose the molten chocolate cake, with orange jelly and blood orange sorbet.  I didn't taste any orange jelly.  The sorbet was sitting on top of some chopped mango.  The cake and the sorbet were very tasty.  It's nice they allow you to choose any dessert because they're all the same price.

As for the service, aside from the question about gazpacho mentioned above, I was enjoying the risotto and was not yet finished with it when the server brought the chicken roulada and placed it along side the risotto.  It's not like the place was crowded and they were moving the guests out quickly.  Shouldn't a server check before they bring out a dish like this?  My iced tea was not refilled until it was time to order dessert.  It should have been much sooner.  I wonder why a tapas place like this bothers with a tasting menu.

There is an adorable patio and the interior is comfortable and well appointed.

I browsed through the menu before deciding on the tuna pita sandwich ($9) and a side of spicy avocado hummus ($5). The sandwich comes with a side of salad or fries, I went with the salad.

The pita sandwich was an enormous portion of tuna. I felt like they put a whole can of it in my sandwich! While the main component was tuna, it also had lettuce, sauce, cheese, tomato, and chopped onion. I appreciated the enormous portion of fish but while eating it I felt like I was often eating plain tuna from a can stuffed in a pita rather than a balance of meat, vegetables, seasoning and sauce. The side salad was delicious and came with romaine lettuce, feta, olives, crispy sweet red bell peppers a lemony vinaigrette.

The spicy avocado hummus came in a small tub with a black olive and feta on top. I loved the hint of spicy kick and creamy avocado flavor meshed with the hummus.

Our hiking group stops here for our après hike snacks and drinks.  There are several pavilions with metal picnic tables.  There used to be a water fountain for the public, but Boulder City removed it because the bighorn had learned to get drinks of water and it created a health hazard for children who are often in the park playing.

We were at the park once when the Nevada Division of Wildlife was darting the bighorn and when they went down, they took blood samples, weighed them, and did other medical tests.  Collars were attached and the bighorn's brief captivity ended with an antibiotic shot and a reversal shot for their dart sedative.  It was like being part  of a National Geographic special.

Prices range from $1 (Typically very basic California-style rolls) to $3 on the belt, although they do have a full menu that you can order other rolls and items from. The menu items are also fairly reasonable as well ($1 miso soup, $3 vegetable tempura). The items on the belt when we went were either rolls (3 pieces per plate) or some type of salad (Seaweed, octopus, or squid).

It was pretty dead when we went here on a weekend night to have dinner, with one or two other tables of people eating here. Most of the rolls on the belt were the most expensive $3 kind, with a few scattered $1 plates. The quality was OK, nothing too special, you basically get what you pay for. The rice in some of the rolls was a little mushy, but the flavors were decent. 

We did end up ordering some miso soup and vegetable tempura from the menu. The miso was alright, and the vegetable tempura consisted of slices of sweet potato, zucchini, white potato, and onion. 

Service was decent, and very friendly. Drinks were refilled as needed.

However, I realized too late that there are no exchanges or returns allowed on electronics, only clothing items. I didn't see any signs stating this policy when I was in the electronics section or when checking out. There was also no way to actually test the monitors to make sure they worked before you bought them. Luckily, while 2 of the monitors I bought work, the screen on one can't be reliably used but I'm only out $10.

This cute little shop sells savory and sweet pies. The mouthwatering pie selections are mainly chicken and beef savory options, with a few vegetarian pies and desserts. I opted for a chunky beef pie ($7.29) and tried a few other items. The pie had a crispy flaky crust and well seasoned beef in a wine sauce. The beef was a little chewy but overall it was enjoyable. I also tried the sausage roll which I think is the best deal for your money ($4.50). It was filled with a lot of ground meat encased in flaky pastry. The bite of shepherd's pie I had was equally tasty and filling as well as a beef and vegetable pasty I tried a bit of.

Drinks are by the bottle and are in a fridge off to the side. In addition to Coke products they have Australian ginger beer which had a spicy kick to it which I enjoyed.

We finished our meal by sharing an apple turnover. The dessert had been refrigerated so the dough wasn't as flaky as the savory pies but I did enjoy the sweet fruity filling. 

The decor is basic but cute with lots of photos of Australia, kangaroos and koalas. There is plenty of seating and we had no problems dining in on a Saturday early evening. Note that they close at 7 PM each day so get here early if you want to dine for dinner.

Also, because the property was built cheaply vis à vis the drainage, anytime we have a good rain means there's flooding behind the IP because the water rushes through the garage and the small channel behind can't take all the water.

The casino is OK, but there certainly are better places in any direction from here except west.  The machines are mostly penny slots these days and the place is a mess with the construction now taking place.

After Project Linq is finished, I'll have to come see how different the IP is.  Until then, unless I'm going to a show upstairs, I'll steer clear of the IP.",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I made one error in that it was First Friday in the Arts District and the restaurant has an abbreviated menu for that evening.

I went with two of their tapas plates and a dessert.  I started with their roasted tomate soup.  It was excellent.  The second dish was their 5 cheese mac and cheese a combination of smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, fontina, Manchego, roasted tomato, piquillo peppers, and parmesan crisp.  The pasta was gigli.  The mac and cheese was very tasty, too!

I rounded out my dinner with a warm chocolate ganache cake.  It, too, was excellent.  It was served with a small scoop of sorbet and it was a perfect ending.

All things considered, I'd rather have come here on a night when I could have ordered from the full menu, but I had the chance to taste some of their good cuisine.  I think it's a bit pricey for what you get.  I enjoyed the decor a lot.  The tables shaped like artists' palettes with a metal well in many.  One thing that got me several times was the thought that I had dripped something onto the table.  When I looked, it was merely some spattered paint when they were decorating the tables.

1. Out of al pastor meat
2. Out of chicken meat
3. Only had enough to make 1 small cochata drink.

This considerably dampened our dining plans. Nonetheless, we ordered 2 regular size carne asada burritos and the last remaining cochata. 

The cochata's horchata component was literally scraped from the bottom of the barrel. As a result, I couldn't taste much horchata flavor. Instead, I tasted more of a vague creaminess with a lot of grit from the bottom-of-the-barrel cinnamon and rice particles. The coffee component was fine. It had a smooth flavor. 

The carne asada burritos were quite flavorful. I enjoyed the marinade the carne asada was in, and there was also a little bit of guacamole and some pico de gallo in the burrito. It came with a small cup of salsa, which looked like it would be good, but tasted bland and watery.

Service was decent and our burritos were made in no time. We got our order to go and along with the cup of salsa, our brown paper sack came with a baggie of lime, radish, and cucumber, and a plethora of napkins.

Hopefully next time if I'm in the mood for America's Taco Shop again they won't be out of most of the main meat components of their menu!",0,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Hummus Xpress offers fast, fresh options that are a lot healthier than what you'd normally consider as ""fast food."" You start with your choice of wrapping or container such as pita, bowl, or plate. You get seasoned rice automatically with your order, and can then choose your meaty protein, falafel, or go veg where you can double up on each section. There are various delicious vegetables to choose from, several hummus flavors, salads, and a last section of condiments and sauce to finish your creation.

I opted for a vegetarian bowl with grilled eggplant, ginger carrots, beet and classic hummus, lentil salad, white bean salad, marinated onion with carrot, chickpeas, and garlic aioli to top it off. Quite a lot of food for a bowl! Each component was full flavored and went well with each other. My favorites of the bowl were the ginger carrots, eggplant, and beet hummus. As a side note, be aware that the garlic aioli is delicious but is made with raw garlic so you will have stinky dragonfire breath if you get it :).

Service was very friendly and cheerful. The space is small so it might be cramped if you go with a large group.

I did notice that there were a couple of things missing from the opening.  There was no tomahawk steak and there were no macarons at the dessert station (that's almost an unforgivable fail!)

Now with the chance to go at night when it wasn't crowded wasn't something I was going to pass up.  They have a locals special of 2 tickets for $17.  Since I was alone, they gave me a ticket good for the other ride and also good for up to a year.  Now I'll go back sometime during the day and see the city that way.

There weren't many people at the top, but those that were there congregated at the side facing the Bellagio.  They were waiting for the next fountain show to get photos.  I didn't want to stand there and just wait and eventually I got to the opening in the fence to take some photos and then move on.

I spent a lot of time just looking at the lights in all directions.  It's especially nice to see the High Roller at the Linq which always gets my attention when I'm driving when I can see it.

We came here on a Saturday afternoon, and the restaurant was bustling with patrons eating tasty brunches. Remembering how empty the previous restaurant, Efe's Turkish Cuisine used to be, it's a welcome change to see a steady stream of customers in this space!

The menu is strictly vegan, and they offer options such as faux burgers made with beet, tofu as egg substitutes, and apple chorizo hash. I decided on the breakfast burrito ($9.75) to go.

Our order was neatly packaged and placed in a nice white shopping bag with utensils and napkins. When we got home, I opened up my to go container to see something that looked more like a breakfast ""wrap"" than a burrito. There were multiple layers of spinach tortilla/wrap holding the ingredients together, and there were a plethora of crisp, leafy greens in the wrap, along with other ingredients such as apple chorizo, scrambled tofu, and garlic sauce. The flavor was fresh, spicy, and an interesting balance of savory and sweet.

My husband got the Arizona bowl, which looked more like a hearty salad rather than a breakfast meal. Despite him wanting to come here specifically, I guess the idea of a vegan breakfast didn't appeal to him after thinking about it, since he promptly cooked up some eggs and bacon and mixed them in with his bowl when we got home!

They also offer smoothies and fruit drinks, which I'd like to try some day.

Holy pierogi, they have some mighty tasty Eastern European food here! We stepped in for dinner and ordered the chef's surprise pierogis, borscht, and a beef cabbage roll for dinner. 

After we ordered we were brought some warm bread with seasoned oil. The bread was soft and very lightly sweet, with a crusty exterior. The borscht came next, a hearty bowl of red stewed deliciousness. The flavors were spot on, and it was richly flavored. It was served with sour cream which was a perfect complement to the stew. 

The pierogis came next. We got mix of cheese, potato, meat (I think we got beef and pork), and a mushroom/sauerkraut pierogi. We requested them fried, and they were lightly crispy with a chewy doughy exterior. All the pierogis were well seasoned and came with some fried onions, sour cream, and a bacon/pork belly mixture. 

The cabbage roll was decent. The beef was a little too dense in texture for my tastes but I did enjoy the tomato sauce it was served with.

They have a wide selection of Eastern European drinks. I indulged in a Russian style Kvas which was delicious. It was like a cross between a soda and a beer, lightly sweet, with a malty taste. It's essentially like a very light beer, with only around 2% alcohol content.

We finished our meal with some dessert pierogis. We had a mix of sweet farmer's cheese and blueberry. Out of the two I enjoyed the farmer's cheese more. The blueberry was made with fresh blueberries but it was a bit dry for me since there wasn't any other additional ingredient in the filling, just whole blueberries. 

Service was very warm and friendly. We did have to remind the servers to give us bowls for sharing the soup and we weren't initially served any sour cream with the borscht though.

Overall it was a great meal. I'll be back for more delicious pierogis and borscht!",17,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I had the chorizo and eggs, which was very well prepared.  The eggs were perfectly done (over easy), the chorizo was flavorful and spicy, and the potatoes were perfectly grilled.  Prices are on the more expensive side for what you get (10 dollars and up), and some items such as aguas frescas will run you a whopping $5 for a glass, but all in all it was a nice meal.

After dinner, I walked through the mall from east to west and back.  I was amazed at the number of places that have absolutely nothing of interest for a person of my age.  It really is a young peoples' mall for the most part.

They have a 3 item (your choice) omelette option and I went with that.  I got mushrooms, spinach, and pepper jack cheese.  The omelette came with hash browns and toast.  I opted for rye toast and it was the swirl rye.  The omelette had a large amount of the three items.  Coffee was brought before I ordered an refilled several times.

A few things about the place.  It's small and quaint with Coca Cola memorabilia.  The menu says breakfast is served to 10:30.  I arrived close to 10:30 and the server, Brenda, told me they could stretch the time a bit and that they will make an omelette any time of the day.  The menu is limited.  Don't expect to get stuffed French toast or exotic flavored pancakes.  This is a basic diner with basic diner food well prepared.  The neon sign inside says 50s Diner and I think they go by just The Diner at LVM because of the other 50s diner in town.  Parking is ample in front and the grounds fo the LVM are really nice--at least what you can see from the entrance.

I had a pleasant time sitting at the counter and watching the cook do his thing and just taking in the behind the scenes activities.  Brenda was a fine server and very pleasant woman.

I've been wanting to try Piero's for many years.  It's one of those places that have a lot of history with the city and some of its famous entertainers and residents.

I was brought bread and iced tea soon after being seated.

For the first course, there was no choice.  It was an agnolotti and cheese combination.  There were five agnolotti in a cream sauce and a triangle shaped piece of fried mozzarella.  The server ground parmesan onto the agnolotti to my liking.  This starter dish was very good.  When eating the fried mozzarella, I couldn't help but think of my students and their senior prom.  They always cleared the place out of mozzarella sticks.  

The second course was a choice salads.  I chose the Caesar and the server did freshly ground pepper to my liking.  The romaine was as crisp as can be and the dressing was great!  A large salad course but I managed!

For the third course, I had to go with the house specialty--Osso Buco.  It was amazing!  The meat gently came off the bone and the sauce in which the veal shank was braised was very good.  The server brought me a cocktail fork and stuck it in the bone to use as a marrow fork.  A straw would have been a good idea, too!  Along with the Osso Buco, there was a nice sized mound of fettuccine.  It had the brazing sauce poured over it.  Again, the server round parmesan over the dish.  I've had Osso Buco a few times before but it was never this good.  You can tell their process takes hours.  

Service throughout the night was exemplary.  There must have been 10 people at least on duty and every one of them worked every table.  I was asked several times if I wanted a fresh iced tea.  When I finished my first glass, immediately a server appeared to take the glass to be refilled.  An empty pack of Sweet 'n Low was removed within moments of putting it on the table.  One of the servers who hadn't been at my table took my check and payment.  No waiting.  It's all for one and one for all.  

Many of the Yelp reviews refer to this as old school.  I agree, and I think it's a great idea.  Seeing the servers with white jackets, watching the plates be pushed by my table on a rolling cart, having service that is outstanding--these may be characteristics of old school, and it's good that some places retain their old school ways.

My only complaint with the place is the mandatory valet parking.  The lot isn't that big.  I can walk.  If some want to valet, let them.  A requirement--no, it shouldn't be!",11,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The frozen custard was delicious. It was rich, smooth, creamy, with a refreshing peach flavor and peach chunks interspersed in the custard. The patty melt was decent. There was a strong rye flavor in the bread which did distract from the rest of the ingredients in the burger though. Perhaps a double patty would be better for this type of bread.

They also have a selection of hot food too if you want to snack on anything. The mix-in selection was also impressive, with items such as various popping boba, regular and crystal boba, jellies, pudding, and grass jelly. 

I had a royal milk tea with grass jelly and had a sip of the banana milk tea with rainbow jelly. If you order an iced drink you have the option of blended or over ice (I chose over ice). The order came out quickly and had a single layer of ice on top, with a sizable amount of grass jelly floating around the top of the cup. The banana milk tea also had a sizable amount of jelly. The flavor of the royal milk tea was well balanced. I could taste the tea and it had just the right amount of sweetness. The banana milk tea was refreshing and cool.

Unfortunately, they will only give you the lunch deals if you eat in, so I browsed through the extensive regular menu. The prices seemed a little high compared to other Indian restaurants in Tempe.

The hike is 3 miles round trip and the elevation gain is about 1,000 feet.  In the spring, after some good winter snow on the mountain, Mary Jane will have some nice water falling down its steep cliffs.  That's the case now in June, 2010.  The falls are never a gusher, but they are pretty.

Please don't cut the switchbacks.  There has been some damage done to the trail because of people taking a shorter route.

On the way up the switchbacks, you'll see a cave off to the left.  When you get to the falls, you can take the trail to the cave.  It's a nice place to have a snack as you take in the beautiful vista.  Walk back to the falls to get the trail back to your car.

To get to the trailhead, drive up Kyle Canyon Road, State Route 157.  After passing the elementary school, there is a side road that goes off to the right to the Echo subdivision.  This is Echo Road.  Follow this road about 1/3 of a mile, and you will see a sign to turn left on a dirt, graded road to reach the trailhead.  

This area is very crowded on weekends so an early start is best.",19,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I went with the Mexican style breakfast burrito with egg. It was a hefty burrito filled with potatoes, cheese, pico de gallo, and egg. Although there was no meat in the burrito, the ingredients went well with each other so well I didn't miss the meat at all. I especially loved the soft fluffy scrambled egg. 

The salsa bar to the side had an extensive variety of salsas, roasted jalapeño, and pickled onions. As for drinks, they have aquas frescas, and while they have a Coca Cola freestyle machine it wasn't working when we were here so sodas were by the bottle.

It only took a few minutes for our order to be made and the burrito itself was gigantic, nearly the size of my forearm! I could only finish a little more than half of my burrito but it made for tasty leftovers the next day.

One thing to note is that you will most likely smell like BBQ mesquite when you leave the restaurant so you know to plan accordingly.

We ordered enough food quite possibly for a small army, including 2 types of guacamole, sushi rolls, ceviche, kimchee fried rice, various tacos, and chile-crab garlic noodles. The sushi roll we had (Shishito roll) was just average. The slight bitter flavor of the shishito pepper, which can be a delectable taste for the senses when roasted, didn't quite mesh with the sweetness of the kiwi + mango-habanero sauce for me. Other fusion items we had were tantalizing though. Some notable dishes were the Singapore crab noodles and the al pastor tacos. The strong flavors of the meat with seasoning contrasted well with the starch component in each dish.

For dessert, they have various options such as cheesecake, mochi, and chocolate cake. 

Service was decent for a bustling and busy weekend night. One of the co-owners came by to check up on us and see how we were enjoying things, a nice touch!

At the NYC deli, the focus seemed to be on preparing really good corned beef and then letting the other ingredients play purely a subsidiary role.  At Slyman's, each ingredient in the sandwich melded together very nicely to make an uber tasty sandwich, from the grilled bread and the perfectly melted cheese to the seemingly mile-high pile o' meat in the sandwich.  I also like how they supply great horseradish to go with your order if you so desire.

I ordered two items from the tapas section of the menu--chicken gizzards with garlic and onion and son doo boo.  The chicken gizzards were good, chewy but that's the nature of the meat.  The son doo boo is supposed to be in beef broth.  The water the two pieces of tofu rested in shouldn't be referred to as broth.  Broth connotes some type of meat/fish flavor.  This had none.  It was merely a watery dish with a side of hot dipping sauce.

It was the wrong day to go to Soyo.  The place is very small.  The tables are such that it's not a good place for a person eating alone.

He really wants to try to get to the root of your pain or soreness, not only through massage, but through adequate prevention, whether it's through change in posture, or relaxation techniques that you can do outside of his studio. 

The studio itself has moved from its original location, 4 blocks away in a professional building complex. His studio is on the 2nd floor, and while there is a parking lot, about half of the spots are reserved parking, which can mean there is a paucity of spots during busy times of the day.

After filling out the new client form, John went over all the questions, and discussed probable causes of muscle soreness and tension, and ways to ease up on tension in my everyday life. 

While your typical idea of a ""deep tissue"" massage involves hard kneading at your muscles, possibly causing some additional soreness to relieve those tight knots post-massage, John operates on a different modality. He prefers to use various techniques to relax the muscles without causing post-massage pain, which is counter-intuitive to him.

During the massage, he used a mixture of different massage techniques, from stretching, to shiatsu, adding heat to further ease muscle tension. Each massage is specially tailored to your situation. John carefully thinks about all aspects of massage, even using a special almond oil because those with nut allergies will not have problems with it (Technically, an almond is a seed).

Ever get one of those days where you just wake up angry? (Or maybe it's just me) Well, I was having one of those days, but after my massage, I was feeling great! I was ready to take on the world with a relaxed and refreshed demeanor.

The price of a 60 minute massage is $80, regardless of type. John operates as a one-man-show, doing the booking and confirmations himself. His massages are definitely worth it, whether you are needing a general relaxation massage or coming in with chronic pain problems.",10,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I pulled on the door several times, and then I walked out the entry way to see if there was another entrance.  No, there wasn't.  Back to the door.  A few more hard yanks and someone from inside came and opened the door.  I had gone brain dead over the fact that video poker bars/restaurants like this lock their doors for the overnight and morning hours as a precaution.  I never thought to look for the buzzer nor was there a sign anywhere saying to use same.  

I did get in, however, and the first thing that hit me was the smell of cigarette smoke both stale and fresh and there was only one customer in the place.  From the reviews, I had expected some, but I got a full shot.  I walked into the restaurant area.  Under the Nevada Clean Indoor Act these places were to be separated from the smoking bar areas with enclosures.  They had the doors, but they were wide open.  Perhaps the the Legislature changing the law during its last session, O'Aces may not need to have the area sealed from the bar.

The waitress brought my menu.  There was a limited number of items on the breakfast section and I chose the 4 egg sausage and cheese omelette.  I got hash browns and my choice of toast was their sourdough.  Coffee was brought quickly and was refilled once during the time I was there although I was asked a second time.  Since I was fooling with my phone, the waitress asked if I needed more time before ordering and I said, ""Yes.""  She left and then it was a wait for her to come back.  I think she knew I was a special case (see getting in the front door above.)

The order was placed and then I waited.  About 15 minutes later, when I was thinking that I had certainly made the wrong decision in choosing O'Aces, the cook brought my breakfast to the table.  He then looked for the waitress because I think he'd been waiting for her to come pick up the order.  Now, there still are only two customers in the place--me and the guy smoking and drinking at the bar.

The omelette was OK.  Nothing special.  It was like they cooked one small sausage link, cut it into small pieces, and then mixed it with canned cheese and put it on the omelette before folding and plating.  It was no 4 egg omelette.  I've made bigger with only two eggs.  It was filling and it got me revved for the Make A Wish Run so it fulfilled its purpose.

I then had to wait a fair amount of time for the check to be brought.  There were still only two people in the place, me and...well you know who.  I put bills in the check holder and I got up and walked toward the bar where the waitress was in deep conversation with the guy at the bar.  That's what had kept her from doing her other work in a timely manner.  I handed her the folder, made my way to the door, pressed the button to unlock the door (see I'm eminently trainable), and out I was into the fresh air.

My omakase is just as others have described.  Course 1 - yellowtail with garlic and peppers.  Course 2 - Mizuna salad with tuna, salmon, a wonderful dressing and some capers for added flavor.  Course 3 - Black cod with a soy miso glaze.  The fish was very flaky and delicious.  Course 4 - filet mignon done medium rare.  I would have liked rarer but it was very good.  Course 5 - Assorted nigiri and a bowl of steaming hot clam soup.  The nigiri was quite good and the clam soup was excellent! Course 6 - I had a choice and I took the chocolate soufflé with a scoop of green tea ice cream with a mint sprig.

This consists of three sliders--the blue cheese burger, the whiskey BBQ burger, and the cheddar burger.   I asked for the burgers to be done rare and they were.  That was a bit surprising because of their smaller size.  They cooked them the way they should.

She took my iced tea order and within a minute, the bus person working with her was at my table with the drink and some sweetener.  

I had looked at the menu online but she pointed out the daily specials menu.  After looking that over, I changed my mind as to the main course.  For a starter, I ordered the grilled polenta with mushrooms and sheep's milk cheese.  The dish was very good.  The polenta with the mushrooms and the cheese made a great combination.

The main course is where I changed my mind.  I ordered off the specials menu the shell pasta in a gorgonzola cream sauce with sliced prosciutto. green peas, and topped with toasted walnuts.  The gorgonzola sauce was excellent and the addition of the crispy prosciutto and toasted walnuts gave it a great flavor and wonderful texture.  I'm glad they had the specials menu.  The pasta was brought to the table very hot.  

For dessert, I got the crema al doppio gusto.  The menu describes it as fennel-infused custard with chocolate mousse and caramelized sugar topping.  The dessert had the fennel custard on the bottom and was topped with the chocolate mousse and then a thin layer of sugar that had been caramelized with a torch.

During the meal, Carol was attentive.  She checked in several times during my time there to make sure everything was OK.  The bus person removed dishes promptly and refilled my iced tea 3 times always without having to ask.  Outstanding.

The best entrees we had were probably the papaya salad and the vermicelli noodles- both very fresh tasting and flavorful.  The scallops in black bean sauce were more of a Chinese style dish, and the scallops themselves were a little tough, served with an anemic amount of veggies (just green pepper).

Other than that, I really enjoyed going here tonight.  It is pricey, but I knew that going in and we had a $25 Restaurant.com certificate.

We were brought the chips and salsa and we ordered the guacamole.  The salsa and guacamole were great!  The waiter gave us plenty of time to study the menu.  When we were not yet decided, we asked him over to answer some of our questions. Based on his full knowledge of the menu items and their manner of cooking, we ordered.  My wife got the pollo rostisado with a side of spinach with garlic and onions.  The side came with her meal.  Since she's such a gringa, she had them make the spinach without the jalapeños (what a shame!).  Her chicken came with a great seasoning and she got the tamarind chile glaze in a side dish.  Together, the seasoning and the tamarind glaze were superb!

I ordered the sea scallops with diablo spiced rice, ripe mango relish, and an avocado leaf crust on the scallops.  This was another winner with great seasoning - spicy on the scallops and good zing with the rice.  I ordered a side of Mexican style street corn with chile arbol, cotija cheese, with citrus and cilantro.  The corn was very good and it also had good spiciness.

I decided to go for dessert, too.  I ordered the churros.  They serve them with caramel inside and some caramel drizzled over them.  There's a small bowl of Mexican chocolate for dipping the churros or spooning on and a small dip of vanilla ice cream.  It was a perfect end to this dinner.

I really like Mundo.  I like the interior with its light wall and the chain lamps hanging from the ceiling.  It really was an enjoyable evening.  Service was prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable.  I know I'll be back!",6,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
fCaJNz9ff4x0x46fPA8nXg,13,2016-01-20,9,5cNNpEc3T2tScMaVXglu4g,4,"I was hungry and in Tempe Marketplace shopping. I walked around and was deciding between a noodle place and The Greek Pita. I checked out the menu and the pitas here looked legit, so I walked in to try out some pita sandwiches.

The menu is varied and the main meats they have are chicken (dark and white meat), gyro meat, kafta kabob (Ground meat kabob), battered fish, and they also have falafel as a vegetarian option. They offer plates, pita sandwiches, and combination deals which include a sandwich, drink, and fries.

I went with the #10: A marinated chicken breast pita with tomatoes, onions, and lettuce. You have your choice of garlic or Greek sauce- I went with the garlic. It was delivered in a short amount of time and looked and smelled amazing. It was served with a mountain of fries. It tasted excellent. The cool vegetables went well with the marinated, grilled chicken and the garlic sauce meshed well with the rest of the sandwich. The chicken itself was perfectly seasoned, and tender. The only slight negative was that the onions were all piled in one area of the pita, so there were a few bites were all I was biting into was pita bread and onion. 

Service was friendly, and while the restaurant is small they manage to pack quite a few booths and 2-seater tables into the area. There is also a limited amount of outdoor seating. 

While the interior smells great from all the grilled food, your clothes might smell of grilled Greek style meats for a bit if you dine in.

I'll definitely come here again for their excellent Greek food.",18,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

This time, he has chosen to make full use of the Colosseum's marvelous LED screen  The panel is 120 feet by 40 feet--the largest in North America-- and it's able to show almost any graphic imaginable. 

The piano is a Yamaha Grand that took four years to build and contains 68 LED video screens.  During the show, the projections on the Colosseum screen are matched by identical images on the piano.  It is amazing.

Sir Elton is more personal during this show.  He doesn't talk at length, but when he does, it adds greatly to the show.  I was interested in how he and longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin produced the music they did over their many years of collaboration.

Although the set list is great from beginning to end, there were three pieces that really got to me--""Your Song"", ""Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)"", and ""Indian Sunset.""  I have loved ""Indian Sunset"" from first hearing and I was glad he added it to this show.

He's backed by a great band and some fine singers.  In short, the show has everything!

MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,1,2013-03-15,1,QHWZrxOdGeoymSnsfJc2VA,2,"*** Review is for Spring 2013 Restaurant Week menu ***


First the food:

The bread basket was brought a fair amount of time after I ordered.  I was told there was honey wheat, ciabatta, white, something else, and their homemade corn bread. As you can see from the photo, the basket was mostly corn bread which was good, but another piece of bread was just plain.

For the first course,  I ordered the potato leek soup with lobster, sour cream dumplings, and jalapeño bacon crumbles.  The dish was presented as a bowl with the lobster, dumplings, and bacon in the bowl and then the soup was poured from a server onto the ingredients listed.  I was asked if I wanted some freshly ground pepper.  When I said yes, the server began a hunt to find a pepper grinder.  Evidently they had been put away from the day before and hadn't been brought back out.  The soup wasn't very hot.  The dumplings were the best part of the soup.  I also liked the bacon.  As you chewed it, the jalapeño flavor was released and left a little heat in your mouth for the next spoon of soup.

There was no choice for the main course.  It was Australian Waygu strip steak with a bone marrow flan and some wine reduction.  I ordered my steak black and blue.  It came out medium rare.  The steak looked a bit like a rectangular hockey puck and it cut about the same.  Inside, it was tender, but the outside was damn tough.  The flavor of the steak was nothing that I'd remember past the immediate bite I was consuming.  It was bland, also.

Course 3 consisted of two sides--asparagus and truffled pave potatoes.  The potatoes were absolutely the blandest thing I could eat.  I ate the truffle pieces that were on the top and enjoyed that the most.  Pave potatoes is their slang for fancy, stacked, thinly cut potato slices with no flavor.  The asparagus was OK.  It was crisp and better than being cooked until it's soft and mushy.  

For dessert, you had a choice of cheesecake or cheesecake.  The menu was different from their Restaurant Week menu online.  The mascarpone cheesecake on carrot coulis had some sorbet and pineapple pieces.  It was good.  It was not the chocolate peanut butter bar I was hoping to order.

The service:

I was stunned by the lackadaisical manner of the staff that served me last night.  I saw my waiter twice, when I ordered and when he brought the bill.  I saw the person who delivered bread and non alcohol drinks 3 times, once with the bread and twice for iced tea.  I saw a bus person three times when he came to remove dishes.  

The score for my pink wrapper test was 50/50.  One test was a fail and one was a pass.  No one came by to ask how the meal was.  I waited a long time before the liquid person came to ask if I wanted some more iced tea.  In short, people just didn't seem to care.  I had more conversation and rapport with the young woman seated at the table next to me than I did the staff.

When my server brought the bill, I asked him to do me a favor.  I asked him to tell the chef that medium rare was not black and blue.  He hesitated for a few seconds as if things didn't connect and then said, ""Oh, it was cooked too much?""  He left the table and never said another word.  It was then that I started to fill out the comment card, something I rarely do.  When the server came back with my credit card slips, he curiously removed the salt and pepper shakers from the table.  Did it look like I was going to slip them into my pocket?

As for the ambience of the place, it was nouveau dark as this photo shows:

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/charlie-palmer-steak-las-vegas-3#ZR8UVgbVry2CagHkQEp4lA

For some reason, after I was there for about 15 minutes, the lights came up half bright for about two minutes and then went back down to this level.  Cozy, romantic, and very dark are all appropriate words.  What really got me the most was looking toward the other room and seeing the reflection of a basketball game.  It was coming from the bar/lounge.  Can't we do without TV in a restaurant like this.  This just bugs me to no end.  If I wanted to eat in a sports bar, I would have.

I really was disappointed by this whole evening.  With so many great steakhouses on the Strip, I won't be returning to Charlie Palmers.",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

You are taken in by the charm of this little shop right when you walk in, with the cute little decorations, accents, and the explosion of lovely pastries that seem to surround you as you browse. In addition to baked goods they offer sandwiches for breakfast and lunch. The bbq meat in the lunch sandwiches are made by a pitmaster they work with.

I ordered a turkey breakfast sandwich with peppers and onions, and an assortment of baked goodies including an almond amaretto cookie, oatmeal cookie sandwich with buttercream filling, chocolate chip cookie sandwich with vanilla buttercream filling, peach cobbler cookies, and an apple pie muffin. 

The turkey sandwich was excellent. The croissant it was served on was huge, and the turkey meat was well seasoned and plentiful. It didn't taste like that super processed stuff that you find in generic round loaves in shrink wrapped plastic. The peppers and onions were the perfect compliment to the fluffy scrambled egg, meat, and cheddar cheese. 

The pastries were good, but a little too sugary sweet for my tastes (The generic ""sugar"" taste was overpowering the other flavors) . The textures were perfect though, especially for the almond amaretto cookie. It had the right balance of chewy with a slight amount of crunch.

Service was excellent and the gentleman at the counter knew the menu well and was very friendly.

I had a show at Bally's and decided I'd walk over to Paris and have dinner at Hexx before going home.  Although in the 90s, the patio was great and the sun was soon behind the Bellagio.  Eating good food and people watching on the Strip--it doesn't get much better than that.

I opted out of an appetizer to save room for dessert (one must have their priorities in order).  For my dinner, I ordered the Spicy Jambalaya described on the menu like this: Gulf shrimp, chicken confit, andouille sausage, and rice.  The dish was excellent.  It was spicy which is exactly what I like.  There was a large number of shrimp and plenty of andouille sausage.

Then it was time to decide on my dessert.  I ordered the single origin chocolate bread pudding described on the menu as: shaved coconut, Ecuadorian chocolate chunks, brioche, coconut milk, and mango sauce.  It takes a little while for this to be made so just have your coffee or iced tea or whatever and people watch.  The time goes by oh so fast.  The bread pudding is huge.  I was so glad my priorities in the beginning proved correct.  I was expecting it to be more chocolaty than it was.  There were pieces of chocolate in the brioche bread but I expected it to really be chocolate bread pudding.  The mango sauce was perfect and the topping of coconut was very good, too!

I really like the show because the songs of the Four Seasons and Frankie Valli This jukebox musical is unlike others I've seen because this one has a true story behind it and it helps make the show a real winner.

I have seen the show three times--twice at the Venetian and now once at Paris.  I have seen three different people play Frankie Valli and I can only say that they've all been very good.  Last night, the Valli part was played by Graham Fenton.  He has a good voice for the role and does it well!

The entire cast is good, and the band is excellent.  The one scene where the brass players come out on the walkway above the stage is especially rich with their good sound.

The small set pieces come on stage and off quickly, generally brought by cast members between scenes and especially when your attention is deliberately drawn elsewhere.  Nice staging!  The lighting is very well done and really adds to the show as do the video screens behind and to the sides.

I was in the 5th row center orchestra and it was a great place to see the show.  I felt like I could reach out and slap Tommy upside the head myself!

At the end, it was very good to see an acquaintance come out for a bow at the top of the spiral staircase--Keith Thompson.  Keith is the musical director/conductor for Jersey Boys and he does a fantastic job!

It's been years since I ate here and I decided to give it a go.  You need to like dining with strangers and meeting new people or go somewhere else.  There were four people from Eastern Washington State and two from Texas at our table besides this local.

We ordered different things, but the chef kept everything going well. A woman comes and takes your drink orders first.  After being served the drinks, she brings everyone a bowl of Benihana onion soup.  Then you get a Benihana salad.  Then the chef enters the picture by arriving at the table with his cart of food.  He starts by cooking some shrimp and flipping the tails onto his chef's hat.  He does some other tricks with his knives including the standard teppanyaki onion volcano tower which he then sets on fire.  I ordered the Teriyaki steak, extra rare.  He cooked it perfectly.  He was just as good with everyone else around the table for their preferences.

With the teppanyaki meal, everyone gets a shrimp appetizer, hibachi vegetables,  dipping sauces, steamed rice and hot green tea.  There is also dessert.  I got the green tea ice cream.  I also paid the premium to have chicken fried rice.

I was surprised by how much food there was and everyone but me passed on dessert,  Silly people!

The entrée did not continue a good impression of the restaurant.  The wait time was longer than necessary, and the fish was not what I like when I get fish and chips.

Since prime rib is only on the higher priced buffets, one must search it out at other restaurants.  The Prime Rib Loft fits the bill nicely.  Boyd sent me a food voucher good at four of their properties.  Prime Rib Loft came to mind immediately.

I made a reservation for 5:30 so I had plenty of time for dinner before going to a play at Las Vegas Little Theatre in Chinatown.

I was seated as soon as I arrived and I had a view of the entire restaurant.  At first, the place was very quiet.  Soon, as more people arrived, the energy level picked up and with it the sound but it was never a bother.

I wanted to get the four onion soup but when you get one of their prime rib meals, with it comes corn showier or house salad and either baked or au gratin potatoes.  It's odd you can';t substitute because both soups are the same price.  The option given to me by my server, Rudy, was that I could order the onion soup à la carte and then get a salad.  I didn't go for that.  Too much food.  I ordered the Orleans cut prime rib--their smallest at 10 ounces--the corn chowder, and the baked potato.  He asked me if I wanted it loaded and I said yes.  Butter, sour cream, bacon bits, and chives.  For dessert I got Oreo cookie cheesecake which isn't on their printed menu.  The menu says to look for their daily dessert cart special and this was it for the day I was there.

I was brought a small bread basket.  I was so glad they downsized the amount for one person.  There's nothing I dislike more than waste.  I can always ask for more.  My iced tea was brought quickly and was refilled often.

The corn chowder was blisteringly hot which is good and which was good.  I got some freshly ground pepper on top.  There was plenty of time to slowly eat the hot soup without being rushed with an early arrival of prime rib.  That just didn't happen.  Rudy kept an eye on me and put the prime rib order in at the right time.

I had ordered the rib the rarest they had.  It was rare and it was very tasty.  Before starting, there was a small show table side.  The baked potatoes are on a cart pushed to your table where your server puts in the items you selected.

I was seated promptly at a high top table in the bar area close to the railing opened to the casino floor.  I got an iced tea, and I ordered bangers and mash for the main course and chocolate trifle for dessert.

The bangers and mash were OK.  Three small sausages of chicken, beef, and pork served with a modicum of mashed potatoes and with some onion gravy and fried onion sticks.  It was a small portion for a mere $24.

The chocolate trifle was very good--it made the evening.  It was made with both light and dark chocolate and topped with Chantilly cream.  There were two small cookies with the trifle.  It wasn't overly sweet.

Service was OK.  My server was a very pleasant woman.  While she brought my iced tea quickly, she was never back to ask about refills.  A busser was going around refilling water glasses so that was a help.

The tacos were good but it was my mistake to order them at the same time I ordered the soup.  They sat there as I finished my soup.  This was my error.

But, unfortunately, it seems like the buffet is only on weekdays.

The food regardless, was very good.  They did the next best thing, which was order the sampler platter, which was a combination of both their cold and hot foods.  It included baba ganoush, hummos, grape leaves, tabouli, falafel, kibbee, and several skewers of lamb and chicken.

This outing was no different food wise from what I remember. The same quality food, although a lot saltier than from what I remember. Also, I feel like for every seafood dish you order half of the content is comprised of butter. Fat is flavor, right? That's the thinking here!

I had the wood grilled lobster, shrimp, and salmon. The seafood itself was cooked nicely and was tender. It came with a salad, baby potatoes, and a side. I went rogue and asked for a corn on the cob instead of your usual sides (Broccoli, various potatoes, zucchini, etc.). The garden salad was alright, an iceberg lettuce concoction with cherry tomatoes and croutons. The potatoes were mealy tasting and the corn was OK. I tried a little of the Admiral's feast which was decent, but The Admiral apparently likes fried clams a little chewy. I tried to eat some snow crab legs but they were super salty (Hmm saltier than the ocean they lived in!) so I could only take a few bites.

Service was excellent. Our server Sunny was warm, friendly, and very accommodating. Our total for 2 large sized seafood dinners and 2 fountain drinks was around $56 with tax.

When I visit Tucson I love getting Sonoran dogs and other specialties like caramelos and vampiros but it can be hard to find them here in the Phoenix area. Moreno's offers all the above in addition to your standard selections you'd find in a typical Mexican restaurant. I had a small size carne asada caramelo and a Sonoran dog. I got the agua de sandia to go with it.

The restaurant is nicely appointed with granite countertops and neutral beige tiles and stone. There is a salsa bar in the center with various salsas, cucumber slices, marinated carrots, and limes. The tables here are evenly spaced out and eating in was a pleasant experience. The order was ready in a short amount of time. The caramelo was quite delicious. It is very similar to a quesadilla except they use two separate tortillas instead of one tortilla folded. The tortillas were perfectly griddled to have a lightly crisp exterior and the carne asada was well seasoned and very tender. The cheese melded well with the rest of the ingredients. The Sonoran dog was a pretty sight to behold, with the different colors of the toppings surrounded by the bolillo roll. It was good, but compared to some fabulous ones I've had in the past the roll wasn't as soft. The roasted white pepper that came with it had a fiery hot kick to it. I loved it. The agua de sandia (Watermelon juice) was so refreshing with the perfect amount of sweetness. I could possibly drink a whole gallon of that stuff!

For the main course, I got their baked gnocchi.  The menu lists the items for the gnocchi as spicy calabrian chili, buffalo mozzarella, and San Marzano tomatoes.  They also asked me about freshly grated cheese and I opted in for some.  The gnocchi were soft and tasty and the sauce was very good, too.  Another dish which could have been shared.

For dessert, I got the chocolate caprese cake.with whipped chocolate cream and hazelnuts.  The caprese cake is made with chocolate and has a strong almond flavor which I liked.  That's one of my favorite flavors in desserts.

I called the garage door service I used in the past as their card attached to my garage wall said ""anytime.""  They really aren't anytime.  When I got an answering machine, I turned to Yelp and found United Garage Door with its high ratings and from people I know. 

I went to their website instead of calling and filled out the service request and estimate form.  Within a half an hour, Tammy called me to get specifics.  She told me she could have a tech here between 3 and 5 PM and that was fine.  It was a Sunday and it was the NFL playoff Sunday.  Tammy asked if the tech could come earlier if people canceled or things went quicker and I was glad to hear this as I had a commitment for 5 PM.  She later called back and told me the tech would be here in about 30 minutes.

At about 1:15, Kyle arrived and he assessed the situation.  No, I didn't need a new door.  Everything but the panels were fine so he suggested I do a panel swap out.  He told me how much it would be.  I picked the color for the new panels and we were almost ready to have it fixed the next day when they got the new panels from the distributor.  One last thing--we got the door up and I got the car out of jail and then between the two of us, we were able to force the door down and lock it in place.

Today, less than 24 hours from when I first met Kyle, he arrived with the new panels and he disassembled the old garage panels and then installed the new ones.  He did a super job and he explained anything for which I had a question.  He lubricated the chain mechanism and showed me how to do it and now I have a working garage door.

I can't say enough about how good the service from United Garage was.  From the times I talked with Tammy--she's absolutely a gem and she's a great first person to talk with when your frustrated over a malfunctioning garage door.  

I removed the old door service from my wall and I had Kyle put a new sticker there for United Garage.  That's my go to service company now.  And, they mean it when they say 24 hour service!!",19,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The menu offers several different beer, wine, and liquor options, from several different regions of the world. Food options are a mix of American, Irish, and British pub type foods.

We started with the medium hot wing drumettes as an appetizer. They were the right amount of heat level- not too hot, not too mild. The sauce itself was very vinegary and the meat tasted a little on the dry side.

As for entrees, I decided on the fish and chips, and tried some of the shepherd's pie. The fish and chips came as 2 sizable pieces of battered fillets, with a heap of fries. Although I ordered it with peas, it came with an extra side of coleslaw. The batter was excellent on the fish: A beautiful golden brown, and very crisp. The fish though, tasted dry. The coleslaw was crisp, but had no flavor. 

Service was somewhat lackluster. Although our server would take away plates, he did not bother to check on our table to refill drinks (Sodas). Even when asked if we could get a refill he forgot to go to our table until we were done with our meal, and by that time it didn't matter to us if we had refills. In addition, it took a long time to get our check.

I wasn't too impressed with the fish and chips, but I did like the shepherd's pie better. The mashed potatoes, ground meat, and veggies meshed well together with the gravy.

Course 2:  Tom Yum mushroom soup.  Very flavorful and very spicy just the way I ordered.  I almost made myself cry!

Course 3:  Pad Thai Ghoong.  Stir fried rice noodles with prawns, bean sprouts, and and a small mound of chopped peanuts.  Very good Pad Thai.  

Course 4:  Bua Loi:  This is a dessert of warm, sweetened coconut soup with small rice flour dumplings.  Very, very good and a reason to go back for dessert alone.

I really like the decor of Lemongrass.  The food was excellent--4 star quality.  I dropped the rating down 1 star because of service.  The meal was rushed.  When I was merely halfway through my soup, the server brought my Pad Thai.  Later, before I finished that main course, the server brought my dessert and when putting it down said, ""What good timing!  You're almost done.""

No, it wasn't good timing.  There should be some time between courses.  It wasn't just me.  I saw an adjoining table where their main courses were brought before they were half done with their soup.  Also, the presentation of the soup with a sloppy spill isn't what I'd expect from a restaurant in Aria.  

I would come back for dessert alone.  The Bua Loi is fantastic.  Look for a photo someone has posted and you can see the small dumplings.",0,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The order was taken quickly but I was surprised that I was never asked for a name nor a phone number.  Not a good way of doing business.

We got an order of Thai egg rolls, an order of Garlic with Black Pepper sauce (extra garlic requested), and an order of Red Curry (Gang Dang) chicken.  My wife thought the chicken was OK but not as described.  The menu notes that it's topped with roasted garlic Thai style but it wasn't.  It wasn't topped with the roasted garlic like every other Thai restaurant from which we've gotten garlic pepper chicken.

My red curry with chicken was flavorful.  Their spiciness is done on a 1-4 scale.  I ordered a 3 and it had a nice spice to it.  I also received a small container of ground red pepper to add more spice if I wanted.  I appreciate it when Thai restaurants do this.  The egg rolls were a but greasy something I haven't experienced before when getting them from other places.

Overall, things were OK, but I don't think I'll be going back.  There are way too many other choices that offer better food at a comparable or lesser price.",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,4,2015-03-27,1,eh8FXFE4TypsavMk_BsnOA,3,"Before a show at the Palazzo, I came here for dinner.  First impressions were not that good as there was no one at the podium.  A waiter came up to me, didn't say anything, and then turned and left.  Another waiter came over and showed me to a table on their ""patio"" along the Grand Canal Shops at the Venetian.  The tables are very close together in this area and as has been stated in other reviews, this is a high traffic area.  I tend to like people watching so I didn't mind the traffic.  It would have been nice if I didn't have to pretend not to hear the conversation of the two women at the table an arm's length from me.

I was brought a menu and asked about drinks.  Soon a server came with three cheese and garlic rolls and some balsamic and EVOO which he left on the table.  My iced tea was brought and I ordered.  Asking the server what was the smallest appetizer, he suggested the caprese.  I ordered the caprese and the pesto gnocchi.  

The caprese was OK.  The tomatoes were hot house tomatoes and not very flavorful and a bit hard.  The burrata was quite good.  The pouch of cheese pulled apart and I could place it on the tomato slices.  My server had done some freshly grated pepper on the caprese and that helped.  The best appetizer would have been simply the cheese with some bread and EVOO and let the tomatoes die on the hothouse floor.

The pesto gnocchi was pretty standard.  There wasn't a strong pesto flavor, but the gnocchi were soft and tasty.

After dinner, the server brought me a tray of dessert replicas and I chose the tiramisu.  It's done in a manner you don't see very often.  Instead of a cake like dessert, this version is mostly cream with lots of chocolate powder and some pieces of cake and chocolate near the bottom of the cream.  This was the best part of the meal.  The cream was perfect.  My only complaint is the dessert was served in a fluted goblet, but in the manner of drizzling syrups and sauces over dishes for looks, the plate on which the goblet rested was lined with caramel sauce and confectioners' sugar.  Why decorate a plate on which there's no food?  In fact, I got part of my hand on the caramel and I needed to find a washroom after I left to wash it all off.

Service was good except for the start.  The place is OK but it's not a place I need to return to for Italian food.  Too many choices in this complex alone.",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I had looked at the menu online, and I had practically decided what I would have before going, but I looked at the menu in any case.Coffee was brought quickly while I was looking at the menu and reaffirming my decision.  I had to go with the Huevos Motulenos.

What an interesting breakfast!  A corn tortilla topped with black beans, peas, sautéed bananas, and feta cheese with two over easy eggs on top and then topped with red and green chili sauce.  The dish comes with home fried potatoes.  Since this is a breakfast and lunch restaurant only, these home fries are made from scratch. These aren't cubed potatoes left over from last night's baked potatoes.  I watched as the one cook cut the potatoes and then stirred them as they grilled.

The menu states that this is a zesty dish.  It was excellent!  I could have used a little Cholula, but I decided to have it as it was served than eat breakfast with lots of hot sauce like I'm known to do.  Service was very good.

I like this small new place--open only 2 months--and it does have a ""loft"" kind of vibe like another reviewer stated.  My only complaint is parking over which Eat has no control.

1KRnx1P4gYlkpmezGTERaA,1,2010-01-24,0,0Q2PDSJ198art7YEXjgN0A,3,"""Free Sushi Fridays?""  Really?  Free?  On Friday we all headed to Touch Supper Club to try out this mythical free sushi.  We soon realized though, that one cannot subsist on free sushi alone.  I was wondering what the catch to having a free sushi night was, and this is it:  Sure the sushi is free, but it takes a long time to be made, and when it does get served it is on a platter that will give 7-10 people enough pieces to make it like an appetizer.  Considering how many people actually are at the bar on Fridays, that does not allow for a lot of people to eat sushi at any time.  

The sushi itself, pretty good.  They have the California-type rolls with faux crab and avocado, some tuna rolls, as well as some nice flavorful sashimi.  

For dinner itself, the meals I tried weren't too impressive.  The Korean burger, while tasty, is not Korean!  Said by my Korean friend herself.  The burger is marinated in a teriyaki-like sauce, with pickled veggies Japanese-style (daikon and carrot).  At the very least, I was hoping for a bulgogi type marinade, or kimchi instead of sweet pickled daikon and carrot.  I mean sure, just the fact that you are asking for a Korean burger is not crying out for authenticity, but really, no element in this burger was Korean at all.  

I also had some of the grilled cheese sandwich, which was very filling, and came with some tomato bisque and fries.  All decent tasting, but I'm not sure I'd go here again for a $10 grilled cheese sandwich when I could probably get a better tasting grilled cheese sandwich for about the same price at Melt.

My main problem with the food is that it took a long time to actually get served to us.  We were starving and it took forever to just get our appetizers.  The server also did not count out the number of extra glasses and silverware settings we needed, so we had to ask for extra settings to get any water or silverware for those lacking it.",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We were seated at one of their lounge style chairs and table.  The patio was not yet opened because of the cold weather.  Having lunch that lasted about 3 hours, it got a little tiresome for me leaning forward and reaching down to get food from the coffee table.  I can see for a dinner or some drinks and a little food, this would be fine.  

Chef Bernardo brought out/sent out several seafood dishes to start the lunch.  After an auspicious start with crostini topped with uni, sea salt, and lardo, we were brought three kinds of oysters and then an oyster shooter. I was impressed by the chef's relating how quickly the oysters were gotten to the restaurant.  The Naked Cowboy shooter with crab and caviar was especially good with the salt of the caviar adding to the flavor of the oyster.

After this, several seafood dishes were brought from hamachi crudo to escolar sashimi to big eye tuna, and tuna belly.  This was some of the freshest seafood I've had in Las Vegas.  The dishes were very creative too.  A standout here was the Poke with macadamia nuts, crispy onions, togarashi, fresh ginger, fresh garlic, and Shoju with green onion pancakes.  What a great combination of flavors.  There were other dishes each worthy of mention but I will lack space to name them all.

We then moved to the hot dishes with Thai chicken wings, onion soup, bacon and eggs ravioli, branzino, Grandma's meatballs with pork neck ragu, sea bass tails and belly, and a vegetable medley of carrots, French beans, and broccoli rabe.  I am known for not eating wings.  These are so good and done so well, they're a delight and I'd go back solely for them.  The onion soup with its pretzel crouton and gruyere cheese ravioli was also a big winner.  I also have to mention the sea bass tails and belly.  Excellent!

Moving on to desserts, we were served Adult Root Beer floats made with Not Your Father's Root Beer (5.9% alcohol) with vanilla bean and cinnamon ice cream.  My float was made with Coke and there were gingersnaps served with the floats.  Along with this we had turtle cheesecake, carrot cake with pineapple sorbet, and salted caramel panna cotta. A double espresso over ice was an additional enjoyment to the sweets!

Service was excellent!  My iced tea glass was constantly replaced with a fresh one and water was added to glasses often.  

Some of the items we had are not on the menu but may be when it's finalized--we were trying them out.  

Herringbone really adds to the restaurants at Aria.",16,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

They had a sign with the new address for their Henderson store.  I bookmarked the place then but never thought to stop.  If you're an avid Yelper, you understand that when it comes to bookmarks.

Since the burger joint went to doesn't serve dessert, and we had plenty of time before going to the Sin City Opera, we drove to Henderson and onto that piece of Eastern Avenue that can be the most frustrating drive.  I had no trouble finding Nielsen's and it was fun introducing my wife to something I enjoyed in Utah.

I got a vanilla concrete with cheesecake.  Concrete is the thick frozen custard whipped with whatever you choose to have in it.  They have three flavors of custard--vanilla, chocolate, and the flavor of the day which was Rocky Road last night.

The concrete was very good and exactly like what I had in St. George.  My wife enjoyed her raspberry sundae.  The shop in Henderson is very small.  There is a considerable amount of old time things to give the shop a nostalgic air.  Check these out.  They are quite interesting.  There's also a small patio in the front with some seating there.

I was soon greeted by my server, Rachael, who left menus for me to look over while she went to get the iced tea I asked for.  When she returned Rachel told me some specials the chef had that night and I opted for one of those--the ribeye cap--asking for it to be done blue.  I also ordered the hearts of romaine salad.

I received their pull apart bread topped with melted blue cheese and chive flavored oil for dipping.  This is really good but you have to hang on to your bread plate and the bread if you want to have any after starters are out of the way.

When the salad was brought, the runner asked if I wanted some fresh pepper and he got the pepper mill and ground a generous portion for me.  The salad comes with a parmesan lemon dressing and it was very good.

The steak arrived and it was very rare as I had ordered and it was very good.  Plated on a bed of mashed potatoes with mushrooms, the steak was tender and as good as Rachael described it to be.

For dessert, I asked about two items and with Rachael's descriptions, I opted for the STK doughnuts and I'm glad I did.  The doughnuts are coated with a maple glaze and having candied pecans.

The salad bar includes 2 types of base greens (Iceberg and mixed greens), with various toppings (Edamame, peas, mushrooms, croutons etc.) and dressings (Italian, low fat balsamic, ranch, thousand island, etc).  

Generally, with any main entree, you will have your choice of side and salad bar, or 2 sides.  They also have more healthy side options such as roasted spaghetti squash and steamed broccoli.  My husband had the chicken trio, and I had the creole fish on our visit.  The chicken was nicely presented, and was fairly tender and juicy.  Of the three different toppings (Balsamic and tomato, mushroom cheese, and mango salsa), my least favorite was the mango salsa since the mango in it, while fresh, wasn't totally ripe.  The creole fish was presented in a Spartan way, with just one piece of fish with a mound of side next to it on a plain white plate.  The fish (Some type of white fish, maybe carp?) was a freshwater white-flesh fish and had a decent seasoning and was cooked well. 

Service was friendly, but we did not have any silverware on our table when we were seated and had to ask for it after our entrees were served to us.  Drinks were refilled quickly as needed.

The meal was good.  I was surprised when I saw an Indian restaurant serving a beef curry stew but I realized the Northern Indian cuisine and the Middle Eastern might be the reason for this.  I ordered the Nihari which the menu describes as a ... ""traditional spicy beef curry, another royalty from India.""  With it, I got an order of garlic naan and some iced tea. On a spiciness level of 1 to 10, I ordered 8.

After ordering, you take a seat and put one of the posts holding your number so they know which table to deliver the food.  While waiting, I got my iced tea from a separate room where the fountain drinks and iced tea were kept.

The wait was no that long and it gave me a chance to get some photos of the interior.  When the dinner came, it was on a school-like lunch tray.  The nihari was in an aluminum foil 'bowl' and the naan was on the side.  In addition, the curry came with some thinly sliced ginger and some jalapeño slices.  The utensils were plastic.

The nihari was very tasty and nicely spiced.  I did dump all the ginger and jalapeño into the stew and it certainly cleared my sinuses before I was finished.  The naan didn't have much of a garlic flavor, but it was fresh and hot and made a good soaker for some of the curry.

A couple of things come to mind when reviewing Lazeez.  I really dislike paying normal restaurant prices to eat as if I'm in a school cafeteria.  Plastic utensils, get your own drinks, aluminum foil bowls--these are all the things that detracted from what was some good food.  If I were to return, it would be for takeout.  At least I'd have proper utensils.  

A couple of other things.  I asked what came with the meal and the person at the register said just rice.  There was never any rice.  The online menu shows the dish with naan.  I was charged for naan.  Maybe that was an additional charge because of the garlic naan.  

The restaurant is strange.  When you walk in, you have a choice of two ways to go--one through the beverage area which looks like it may be bar seating in the future or you can go to your left and past some tables to get into the place.  Walking straight ahead will take you into a divider which is an odd setup.  There are two distinct eating areas and they're completely different.  I can't figure out who designed the interior but I might have been able to do better.  I'm not sure how much the previous place figures in its current design but it is odd.

Altogether it was good food which was detracted by the way it's served especially that damned, little plastic spoon.  Oh, and spend a little extra and get some decent napkins instead of giving a customer 5 of thin small diner ones.",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

At noon on Sunday, it wasn't too busy and there were only a handful of people in the restaurant. In addition to the sauce-laden seafood they also serve fried baskets and sides such as potatoes, corn, and fries. 

We ordered 2 pounds of shrimp, 1 pound of clams, 1 pound of green mussels, and 1 pound of snow crab. Quite a feast! We also had a corn cob each, which was thoroughly soaked in the hot and juicy sauce for maximum flavor. We ordered each seafood in a different sauce, with the hot and juicy sauce being my favorite, and the cajun sauce my second favorite. Out of all the seafood, the snow crab and shrimp were the best. The clams were large and had a lot of meat to them, but they were a bit chewy. Same could be said for the mussels. We ordered every item as ""medium"" spicy which was just right for us. 

Service was good for refilling drinks and providing extra gloves. The kitchen was on the lethargic side though as it took some time to get various parts of our meal out.

There are 2 menus. The fancy looking gold menu seems to have strictly traditional style Chinese dishes, while the regular looking menu has a mix of traditional and Americanized dishes. We ordered from both menus and decided on the sizzling rice soup, lotus root with baby bamboo, fresh steamed fish, and walnut shrimp. All were delicious and well presented. Flavors were well balanced, and very beautiful looking. Some minor issues were that some of the bamboo was tough tasting, so it wasn't really baby bamboo, and the walnut shrimp had slightly too much mayo/creamy sauce on it. The star of our meal was the fresh steamed fish. Our waiter informed us it was very fresh (Probably brought in very recently), probably one of the largest tilapia I've seen!

After finding out the weights of the various steaks. I didn't want 18+ ounces in a steak so I ordered their ""signature house-aged bone in sirloin.""  I ordered it cooked blue.  I also ordered a side of the Special Spud.  Last night, it was mashed potatoes with jalapeño pieces, bacon bits, and cheddar cheese.  For dessert I got the Sticky toffee pudding.

I was brought a nice bread basket with two types of bread and some whipped butter.  The server brought my iced tea and it was kept filled throughout the time I was there.  The steak came and it was done exactly the way I like it--nice grill marks on the outside and cold, red on the inside.  It was a good steak.  The Special Spud was very good, probably the highlight of the evening which isn't necessarily a good thing when a side is what you remember your dinner for.  The sticky toffee pudding was good, also.  It came with some whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Service was attentive and pleasant from the time I was greeted at the door to leaving. My server was Bobby and he was a very pleasant gentleman.  I enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant and it got to be fun when some more people came in and I could overhear the tourist talk going on.

A solid steakhouse but it's not in my top tier of Las Vegas steakhouses.

There's nothing I like better than to have Asian comfort food when it starts getting chilly in AZ. Pho Winglee has a wide selection of noodle soups, rice dishes, and rice noodle dishes that will satisfy any craving for Vietnamese food you might have.

The restaurant shares space with a small grocery store that sells goods catering to the Southeast Asian palate. The restaurant area itself is no frills, with minimal decor and your standard setup of tables and chairs. The menu though is filled with a lovely selection of mouth watering food. We ordered some spring roll and egg roll appetizers, and I had the #28 shaking beef with fried rice. 

The shrimp spring roll was filled with vegetables, shrimp and rice noodles. It was refreshing and delicious. The pork spring rolls were decent but the meat inside had more of a chewy texture so I liked the shrimp version more. I didn't try the egg rolls but they looked very good, fried until perfectly golden brown.

The shaking beef was AMAZING. It came out on a sizzling platter, blistering hot with steam rising from the meat and vegetables. It was made with onion, red and green bell pepper, and beef chunks. Once it had cooled down enough to eat it, I was in heaven. The beef was so meltingly tender and buttery (Due to the texture and also because they add melted butter to the dish). I had to give everyone we were eating with a piece and they all agreed the beef was out of this world. The vegetables were well cooked. The bell peppers were crisp and sweet, and the onions were soft, caramelized and browned. 

My friends ordered pho dishes which were huuuge. You could dunk your face in one of these bowls and go bobbing for noodles and meat if it weren't for the 2nd degree burns from the hot soup ;). I will definitely have to get their pho next time!

I also indulged in a passion fruit drink, made with fresh passion fruit. I loved it. It was tangy sweet, and so refreshing. It was a perfect compliment to go with my beef dish.

Service was friendly and the owner? (Or manager?) stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our meals. He also helped us with explaining some of the selections they had in the mini market. You can tell he puts a lot of pride and effort in his business and I love supporting small businesses that are like his.

So if you are craving a taste of Vietnamese cuisine this is a superb choice!",20,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I called ahead and while they do not accept reservations they can put your name on their list before you head out to shorten any waiting times. At around 5:15 it was moderately busy and by the time we left it was pretty packed with patrons.

We started with the arancini. These little fried rice balls were perfectly cooked with a crispy outer coating, tender rice, and sausage. The marinara sauce with them was robust and went well with them.

The other entrees were nicely presented and for the most part everyone was happy with them. The fish dishes (Salmon and mahi mahi) had a smoky flavor to them from the use of cherry and oak wood on the grill. The only slight negative for my mahi mahi dish was that the artichokes in the sauce were cold compared to the temperature of the fish.

Dessert was a hefty portion of tiramisu. Creamy, chocolate deliciousness!

Service was excellent. Our waitress was cheerful, friendly, and had good knowledge of the menu. Drinks were filled as needed, and were plates taken away in good time.

However, the pasta tasted rubbery, and the shrimp was overcooked and tough.  My husband's ziti was pretty good though.  It was a large amount of pasta, with a nicely browned mozzarella topping.  The sauce itself had a nice smokey flavor to it, and the pasta was perfectly al-dente.  Service was good.  Drinks were refilled promptly as needed.

For those who've been around Las Vegas community theatre, Zenoch is Enoch Augustus Scott who has been in a good amount of theatre most memorable in ""Cannibal! The Musical.""  As the MC of the show, he's very good!  He's funny, he keeps the show moving along, and he has a good voice.

Understand that if you come to Zombie Burlesque, it is goofy, crazy, corny fun.  All of the actors give 100% to make this a good show.  Besides the fine performers, there's a LIVE seven piece band on a raised platform above the stage and they really pump out the music in very fine fashion.

The show moves through different scenes--one in a graveyard, one a take on the Newlywed Game of years past, one with audience participation--a man selected by a female zombie.  It's a funny premise.  After the vodka bottle and the Jell-o box hook up on stage, the audience receives a small plastic cup with a Jell-O shot.  There was one somewhat classic ballet dance that was very well done.

The show runs for about 70 minutes.  It's in Theatre 3 of the V Variety Theatre complex.  The theatre is on the second floor.  With the show starting at 8:30, you're invited to go upstairs before 8 and enjoy something from the bar until the show then playing lets out and they start seating for the Zombie Burlesque Show.

As for photos, I was told by an usher that they weren't allowed.  Just before the show started, a voice announced the rules by saying ""there are no rules.""  I went with the voice over the usher.

The Black Sheep is a relatively small place on Warm Springs that I found while checking the Restaurant Week listings.  I made a reservation but they were unable to find it.  There was no cause for alarm as it was early and there were plenty of tables available without taking one at the bar.  (The reservation was later found and the gentleman told me about it so I would know I did indeed make the reservation.)  This was the beginning of what was to be excellent service and attention paid by the people in charge to make sure their guests were enjoying their  food and that your being there was appreciated!

Items ordered along with their menu descriptions:

Vietnamese imperial rolls - Duroc Pork & Shrimp, Pickled Heirloom Carrots, Garlic Citrus Vinaigrette
Slow cooked short rib - Yucca Gnocchi, Summer Squash Ratatouille
Chocolate tres leches - Chocolate Sponge Cake, Condensed Milk

All meals for Restaurant Week were served with wine pairing for each course.  I don't drink so they did two things for me.  There was no charge for my iced tea and they brought me a bowl of house made lotus root chips that were absolutely addictive.  They were very thinly sliced pieces gently fried and salted.  A good starter to munch on while awaiting my appetizer.

The imperial rolls had a thin coating of gently fried batter around the pork and shrimp ""sausages.""  The garlic citrus vinaigrette was excellent and added so much to this simple dish.  The short rib was tender and could be pulled apart just using your fork.  The yucca gnocchi need some work as they were not soft at all.  The summer squash ratatouille was very good with the short rib.

The chocolate tres leches needs work too or it needs a change of name.  While it is a sponge cake and it was a bit moist on the inside, it doesn't come near being what tres leches cake should be.  It was quite firm.  There was a chocolate ring on top and the server poured white chocolate sauce over the chocolate ring.

My server was Shepherd and he was very good.  As I said at the beginning of the review, service was superb here.  Someone was coming by often checking to make sure everything was OK.  A few changes in the cooking would rank this as a 5 star place in my estimation.",21,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Service was good.  The young servers seemed surprised that a caucasian would like the spicy food so much.  I will return and try some of their other, more exotic dishes.

Thanks to fellow Yelpers for giving me a reason to stop here before going next door to see a play at the Las Vegas Little Theatre,",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

It was prepared to order, and the salad maker was very considerate in making sure I had all the toppings, amount of dressing, and spice that I wanted for the salad. The salad itself had a nice balance of romaine, tomato, crouton, dressing, and cheese. The slow cooked chicken in it was very tender and went well with the salad. As always, I'm loving the Maine Root soda fountain.

The only real negative was that there were a few large chunks of romaine stem in the salad which were very hard and not very edible to me. I ate all of my salad except for those hard chunks.

They have both lunch and dinner buffets.  Lunch is $7.99 and dinner is $9.99.  The weekend buffet goes to $11.99 and I don't know if there is anything different to make weekends more expensive.

I had the buffet and my wife had Saag Chicken.  Her dish was very good.  She asked for it not spicy at all.  There was some spiciness, but she could live with that and it's good that she is growing in her tastes.  The buffet was good except for a major glitch which soon smoothed out.  Something happened to the heated water under the steamers, and some of the food had cooled somewhat before they got it back up to piping hot.  I won't remember all the dishes but they had vegetable samosa, a spicy lentil dish, chana masala, aloo palak, jeera rice, chicken korma, tandoori chicken, chili beef, and gulab jamon.  Except for the temperature issue, the buffet food was quite good.  I tried some dishes I have never had and it was all good.  The gulab jamon was outstanding - the first time I've had this dessert.

One issue we had was with an order of garlic nan.  There was no garlic.  There was a mixup in orders.  He deleted the amount from the bill.

We will be returning and it's close to home, so I can to take out, too.

The buffet is from 6-8 P.M. and if you sit outside they will give you a taste of their traditional Polynesian dance shows + fire spinning they offer for private events/parties. The buffet itself is also an example of what their catering services can provide for any event. 

The buffet was well laid-out and consisted of all three salads on the menu (Spinach, mac, and Hawaiian), white and brown rice, katsu chicken, teriyaki chicken, kalbi short rib, kalua pork, chop suey/garlicky rice noodles, tropical fruit (Fresh mango, pineapple, and papaya) and grandma macadamia chocolate cake. Quite a lot to choose from! My favorites of the buffet were the katsu chicken and the kalua pork. Other foods such as the kalbi, had great bbq'd flavor but were a little chewy for me.

The show was spectacular as we watched the talented dancers perform some traditional Polynesian numbers, with the amazing MC showing off his fire eating and fire spinning skills. Although it was freezing outside the dancers performed with ease and grace, and the fire spinning provided some welcome temporary warmth. :)

I was definitely stuffed after 2 rounds of buffet plus the cake and the show was a unique aspect of the dinner which was much appreciated, especially since it was essentially a free performance included with our dinner.

Or a concerned Donut Nazi?) sent me a private message accusing me of working for Yelp after saying their Thai iced tea was too sweet, I was hesitant to try the new location. I figured though, we'll let bygones be bygones. A new location has the promise of a new donut experience! 

The menu is quite extensive as they have a wide selection of donuts, sandwiches, breakfast burritos, coffee, and smoothies. I decided on a chicken breakfast burrito and a few donuts to go. The burrito was made right on the spot and took only a few minutes to make. It was a decent sized burrito, with grilled tortilla, scrambled egg, cheese, hash browns, and grilled chicken breast. I appreciated that the chicken option exists since usually you only have ham, sausage, or bacon as your breakfast burrito options. There was a balanced amount of ingredients and it wasn't super salty which I really liked. The hash browns were slightly mushy but overall I enjoyed the burrito. 

The donuts were excellent. I tried a cake donut with maple frosting. The cake was a perfect texture, not too dense, slightly pillowy light. It was a good amount of sweetness and the maple glaze was just the right amount. There was a slight crispness around the edges to contrast with the softness of the interior. A cinnamon sugar twist I had was very fresh and soft.

Service was good and I didn't need to repeat my order several times to the cashier unlike my previous visit at the old location :)

They offer two sizes of bowls and currently have beef, pork and chicken protein options with a limited time beef tongue bowl ($5.99 base price for small). Since it was offered for a short time I figured why not? It was sliced thinly, and you have your choice of rice, salad or both, mix ins, and sauce. Note that the beef tongue doesn't come with sauce and is lightly seasoned. I had it with brown rice ($2 extra), pickles and fried onion. 

For the most part the beef tongue was tender, although there were some pieces that were a little hard/tough. The seasoning was spot on for me, just enough to highlight the flavor of the beef. The pickles were a crunchy punch of savory salty flavor and the fried onions were the kind you can get at the Asian grocery store. The brown rice base was a little overcooked and mushy for my tastes, not worth the extra $2 in my opinion. The bowl itself tasted OK but for the price I paid I would have liked some fresh vegetables or more variety of toppings to choose from. I suppose part of the cost factors in the sous vide style of cooking but for the price I paid I could make something similar at home (I'm a food nerd and have a sous vide).

I also got an Earl Gray milk tea. It was refreshing and lightly sweet. It comes premade with no mix ins.

The shop has very limited seating, maybe 2 tables so getting your order to go and either taking it home or eating it at the food court is most likely your best bet.

The meal only took a short time to be made and the pita was a huge portion of layered seasoned chicken breast, romaine lettuce, tomato, onion, and garlic sauce. All the components tasted great together, although the chicken was very slightly overcooked. The fries were a hefty portion as well. They were lightly crisp and went well with the pita. I could only finish a portion of them though because they gave me such a large amount to eat through.

The one thing that annoyed me the most was that the pita was very hard to eat without all the contents spilling left and right. As I ate the pita, the fillings fell:

Onto my shirt which made a large orange stain on it,
Onto the table,

I had the large, 4 scoop bowl with spring mix, scallops, salmon, tuna, and spicy tuna. For dressing I had a house and house spicy blend and toppings included crabmeat, cucumber, and jalapeno.

I asked about the 6 course tasting menu and my server described the courses.  When he knew I had a show at 7:30, he thought I might not have enough time for the meal.  The he said, ""We'll make it happen.  We'll move things along.""  The meat course was the only course in which I had a choice.  You could choose either a filet or a lamb chop. 

In a few minutes, Michael brought a tray with four kinds of bread--cheese dusted lavash, cheddar bacon rolls, mini baguettes, and a cherry walnut bread.  I asked for some lavash and the bacon cheddar roll.  I didn't want to fill up on bread.  Note:  with the bread, they serve butter with ground salt on top (hooray!)

The first course was a seafood course.  There were four compartments on the dish and each one had a small portion of a different fish.  The small spoon had crab, to the right there was some tuna, above on the right was a carpaccio of octopus and to the upper left was albacore tataki.  Each had seasonings including an avocado purée on one, a small piece of melon with another and so on.  Great presentation.  Wonderful flavors!

Course 2 was the salad course.  There were two parts to this.  One was a small cup of warm tomato soup that was superb.  I asked Michael if it was on the menu, but it's not.  It really was tasty.  Along with the soup was a salad consisting of a wedge of yellow and red tomato.  It's been a long time since I had tomatoes with so much flesh and almost no seed.  There were 3 or 4 green beans lying diagonally across the tomatoes and there were some small cherry tomatoes and some more avocado purée.  Very light and lots of summer flavor.

Course 3 was the first fish course.  A bottom layer had a polenta flan.  On this was the grilled eel and on top of the eel was a fried quail egg.  The dish was decorated with some tasty cheese tuile.  The eel was moist and soft and fell apart with just a touch.  It was perfectly cooked!

Course 4 was the pasta course.  It consisted of agnolotti that was topped with pieces of lobster meat and there was some basil olive oil drizzled around the base of the pasta.  This was excellent also!

Course 5 was a second fish course--sea bass.  The bass was placed on a layer of what appeared to be thin pasta.  After delving deeper, I found that they were extremely thin, narrow slices of yellow and green squash that could have easily been mistaken for pasta until you tasted them.  Very clever execution and very tasty sea bass.  There was also a piece of melon and a grilled cherry tomato.  You can see how the chef likes to mix contrasting flavors.

Course 6 was the meat course and I chose the lamb chop (rare).  It was an herb crusted chop that had been removed from the chop with the bone left there to chew on when the main part was gone. There was some pea purée and some more basil oil.  It was truly superb!

For dessert, I first got a plate with three sorbets--blackberry, mango, and raspberry--and there was an extremely thin piece of white chocolate placed in the mango.  It was so delicate it almost melted when I picked it up.  Then I was brought a pretty plate with grasshopper cheesecake and some house made mint ice cream with chocolate flecked throughout.  There were also some chocolate decorations, a loop and a rod that were very good.  Last, I was brought 2 mignardises.  One was a watermelon jelly candy and the other one I think was marshmallow but I may be wrong.

Huge thanks to a great serving crew--Michael, my server, a young woman who was a busser in my area and had a wonderful personality, and the runners from the kitchen who explained each course beautifully.  It's too bad it wasn't recorded so I got more things correct in this review.

Michael took my credit card as time got short and I left the restaurant about 10 minutes before the start of Rod Stewart.  They did an outstanding job of moving the courses along and I was in my seat with 5 minutes to spare.

There is a free-range mini fridge that is stocked with sweet , hot peppers, and fry sauce which is nice so you can customize your order with as many or as little peppers as you want.  While the ingredients were good quality, the cheesesteak as a whole naturally doesn't really compare to any I've had in Philly, but it's good for Arizona!

The sweet potato fries were my favorite part of the meal.  They were excellently cooked with just the right amount of crunch while still tender and sweet inside.

So would our forefathers be impressed by Forefathers?  They probably wouldn't know what a cheesesteak would be, but if they tasted one, I would say they would be!",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

It didn't want to do anything but agitate the clothes--no draining, no rinsing, no spinning.  After checking online for some possible fixes, I found a way around the problem that worked for the first load.  It didn't work for the second load.  Since the washer was recently repaired, I decided to replace it rather than keep pouring money down a bottomless pit.

After a full morning including a reasonable wait at the DMV, I stopped and finally got my Starbucks. (sigh of relief!) As I entered RC Willey's, a woman asked me if she could help me.  I'm sure I had that male, deer in the headlights at a furniture/appliance store look.  I asked her if the coffee was OK and she answered, ""Certainly!""  OK, three stars right there!

She directed me to the appliance area and within a few minutes, I bought a new washer and dryer, very similar to what we now have but 12 years newer and with a 5 year warranty.  They will be delivered Saturday.

The salesman, Jamie, was a pleasant enough fellow and I was on my way in no time at all.  This was a better than expected experience!

The rolls come with the option of peanut sauce or hoisin sauce to dip them with. I chose the peanut sauce. The rolls themselves were big and filled with a lot of vegetables and noodles but very little chicken. Unfortunately they tasted bland and I needed to dip them in the sauce to get any flavor. The sauce was served hot though, which eliminated the refreshing component of spring rolls that I typically enjoy about them.

The silver noodle salad was a gigantic portion, with nicely cooked shrimp, vegetables, and a hearty portion of noodles. It was served with a whole wedge of cabbage, kind of strange if you ask me. People don't normally gnaw on whole wedges of cabbage as a side to go with their meal. The noodle salad had a good spicy kick to it from chiles and definitely had a lot of flavor.

Service was friendly and I had no problem redeeming a Yelp check in offer.

They had a burger special, too, but instead of the scallops I had planned to order, I went with the prix fixe anniversary menu.

The meal started with an amuse-bouche--a demi tasse size cup of their squash soup with toasted pumpkin seeds and pumpkin seed oil.  It was very tasty and it's a draw to get me back to try more.

I was brought the standard metal container with two slices of bread and two of lavash and some honey butter.  The breads were good.

The first course was a salad with pork belly.  The pork belly was cooked nicely and the greens had a tasty vinaigrette dressing.  There were red and yellow plum tomatoes in the salad.

The second course was ahi tuna.  It was seared perfect;y with a red interior.  The ahi was served on red and white quinoa and some of their house made salsa.  The seasoning of the quinoa and the ahi were excellent!

For dessert, the only course with a choice, I went with their butterscotch pudding.  It came in a glass jar and on the lid were some Cracker Jacks.  The lid was removed by the server and placed on the plate.  There was a layer of cookie crumb beneath the pudding and then some chocolate pudding below.  Great!

Service was as good as some of the top restaurants on the Strip.  I never had more than a few sips of my iced tea when the beverage person was at the table refilling my tea.  When I got coffee with dessert, he was back twice to refill my cup.  My server, Erik, was a pleasant, genial man and he made me feel welcome for my first visit to Honey Salt.

5CJOaZc8Muu8WothauxQ4g,11,2015-08-08,10,HE1FnXTXM0wXOGE_XnWnSA,4,"Pizza Forte opened just over a week ago in a small spot in the Hard Rock Hotel.  Owned by Mimmo Ferraro, It's obvious that their forte is pizza--New York Style sold by the slice or one can order a custom 14"" or 18"" pizza.  They also sell hot dogs, meatballs, and cannoli, filled when ordered and not pre-filled like most places.

Four of us had dinner at Ferraro's Italian across Paradise from the Hard Rock and after stuffing ourselves silly there, we decided to walk over to the HRH and try the new pizza place.

Not being a large consumer of pizza, I do know good pizza when I have it.  I've had enough life experience in New York and Las Vegas to have tried a lot of different pizzas.

I had a slice with sausage and pepperoni.  The toppings were just the right amount, the cheese was quite good, and the crust was browned just right.  I somewhat folded the large slice and scarfed it down in a short time.   Excellent!  While I usually don't get NY style pizza often, I know that they're doing a great product.

The dining room is shaped like a small L.  Entering from the casino, you walk past some tables here and there and reach the counter with a large Order Here sign and you can see the pre-made pies under heat lamps.  Then pay at the cashier and you're all set to try some of  the best pizza in Las Vegas.

If Pizza Forte was closer to where I lived, I'd be there more often.  At it is, the few times I'm at the Hard Rock, this is a very enticing option for quick, solid food.",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I didn't watch the Cake Boss show but I knew about it and wanted to try the restaurant.  We were early and they were still serving lunch so we ordered an appetizer so we could order off the dinner menu.

We got an order of Nina's mozzarella en carozza.  It was like having a toasted cheese sandwich with mozzarella cheese with some tasty marinara.  It was very good.  We shared the order and each had two wedges.

For our mains, my wife ordered  Nonna's lasagna.  It came with beef, pork, sausage, and four kinds of cheese and it was huge.  We could have split this between the two of us had we known how large it would be.  It probably weighed a pound at the very least and it was very good.  We brought 2/3 of it home and have it frozen for a meal for the two of us.

I got the Sunday Gravy.  How could I not go with his signature dish.  It's meatballs, sausage, lamb, and pork simmered in a Sunday gravy and served with a bowl of rigatoni.  The rigatoni was a sensible serving size, but when you added all the meat, this also was a dish that could have been shared.  This dish is worth the praise it gets from reviewers.  The Sunday gravy is excellent and the meat is so tender from the hours of cooking in the gravy!  Saving room for dessert, we opted to have part of this boxed also.

For dessert, we wanted something small and went with our server's recommendation of the Nutella Cake, cake with a warm Nutella center, chocolate sauce, some praline crunch, and served with salted caramel ice cream.  It was delicious and perfect to share at the end of the meal.

Our server, Graciela, was a gem.  She was around often to check on us.  The bus people refilled iced tea glasses quickly,  Service was very good!  The only drawback was the large Palazzo sign along the Boulevard which was at the level of the windows and was extraordinarily bright.

Looking to fill my saturated fat intake and caffeine jolt for the day, we headed here on a mission for some good eats. There was a fairly steady line while we were here at the restaurant. We got here around noon, and they were already sold out of chicken wings, and at least half of the donuts (Btw, who sells out of chicken wings by lunchtime? Is there a secret coalition of dedicated eaters who descend upon the restaurant like a plague, to only voraciously consume chicken wings in the wee hours of the morning? We may never know...). Anyways, I had a breast combo which included a side and donut. I substituted a chipotle limon donut for the plain cake that is normally included with the meal, and had the slaw and Vietnamese sauce over the chicken. I also had an iced coffee.

The donut was excellent. It had the right balance of tender, yet chewy cake contrasting with the slight crunch on the outside. I also liked how it wasn't exceedingly sugary, which allowed a better balance of flavors to show through. 

The slaw was crisp, with a good mixture of sweet and vinegar. My friend had the cucumber salad, which was too salty overall, but had a good crisp texture. The chicken was expertly cooked, with a perfect crispy crust, and juicy, tender meat. I tried some of the Korean spicy sauce and preferred it to over the Vietnamese style sauce on my piece. Strangely enough, the Korean style sauce was more subtle than the Vietnamese sauce, not something you'd often say when comparing the two cuisines! For me, the glaze on my chicken was too concentrated.

The iced coffee was smooth, and had more of a lighter flavor. For add-ins, they have milk, cream, and almond milk, as well as Stevia and sugar in the raw.

Service was fast and friendly, and despite having a steady stream of customers to serve, our orders came out quickly.

She doesn't call it that but she's like the Energizer bunny.  The big reason for going other than I like Cher was to see this new Park Theatre which recently opened.  I watched as the 5,000+ seat building was being added to the Monte Carlo replacing the much smaller space where the Blue Man Group had played.

In order to avoid the rush from the NY NY and Monte Carlo garages after the show, I parked at Aria and walked to the MC.  It's a short walk and it was quiet when leaving the venue after the show.

I also found that I had selected the perfect place for sitting.  I was in the first row of the 305 section (Row D).  I know that at most concerts, people stand, wave their arms back and forth, and otherwise pay for a seat they don't use for much of the concert.  I know my age is showing.  When I looked at the seating map online, it appeared there was a gap between my row and those in front of me and that's correct.  Three of the 300 level sections have booth like seating with cocktail tables and menus.  These were mostly empty and the only person in front of me was with the Cher show as he had an all access badge.  There was no one standing and waving their arms in front of me.  I also noted that the floor seats didn't appear to have much pitch to them so I would definitely avoid them.

This seating also has the advantage of only being four rows down from the entrance and I was out of the main theatre in a flash and quickly walking down the steps and through the casino.

I know now where to sit in the future but the offerings at the Park Theatre are not entertainers I'd generally see at least from what has been announced.

At first I was seated at a table on one side of the restaurant but then one of the servers came and told me the table was too close to one of the large round tables and moved me to a similar table right next to another large round table that had a large number of people there.

It was after 6 PM but I was also given a lunch menu along with the regular menu.  They didn't have iced tea so I just asked for water.  After being moved, I was brought a pot of tea with my water and I ended up having two servers.  I ordered the scallops that were under the House Specialties section.  My server didn't understand what I wanted so I told her the number.  That didn't work either and she took the menu from me and started looking through the pages.  I gently got the menu back and showed her the correct item.  I also asked about a cup of soup but she indicated their soup was only large bowls.  I guess maybe if I had ordered a lunch special, I could have gotten a smaller portion.

A different server then took over and he spoke English.  He brought my dinner and asked if there was anything else I needed.  The scallops were on a bed of crispy seaweed that made a great counterpoint to the flavor of the soy based sauce in which the scallops were wok fried.  They bring you a large bowl of rice.  The menu showed a red pepper next to the dish indicating it was spicy.  It wasn't.  Maybe I got the non-Asian version because the server also brought me a fork before my dinner came.

I did like my dinner but if I come back here, I'll snag one of my Asian friends to order for me and make sure the dish is spicy.  This would be a four star if the ordering had been easier and if the dish was spicier than it was.

On a side note--this was a Saturday night and while I was there, a mini-bus pulled up and 5 of the large round tables were filled with tourists who are taken from the Strip to Chinatown for their dinners.  The place filled quickly and became quite noisy.

If you aren't looking to have a lot of conversation this might be your place at lunch because the din from the diners was so loud I feel like I had to nearly shout at my dining buddy Merichelle V. in order to be heard lol.  

The menu is an intriguing mix of Mediterranean and Asian influenced foods. We decided to split the falafel burger and the Korean BBQ brisket sandwich to have the best of both worlds. Out of the two I enjoyed the brisket more. It had tender slow cooked fatty beef. Although it was touted as a Korean style meat I didn't really taste anything totally convincing me otherwise. Maybe some kimchi or gochujang would help? Maybe it was marinated in bulgolgi seasoning but the seasoning or preparation wasn't distinct enough to make me think ""Oh this is Korean!"". It was served with some pickled shredded vegetables, lettuce and encased in a lightly toasted bun. The overall flavor was good.

While I appreciate the idea of a falafel burger, I didn't really feel like eating one was a good alternative to just ordering a regular falafel platter with pita. It seemed like it was a burger only for the novelty factor. The patty itself was very thick and had a one dimensional texture and taste, combined with bread that was too thick to go with the falafel. With each bite I felt I was eating a lot of bread and not enough filling. 

Sides were a mixed grains salad and fries. The fries tasted like the kind of stuff mass produced and from a freezer bag but were fried so they were lightly crisp. I liked the combination of textures in the salad but it tasted a bit bland to me.

Service was great from Patrick who was good at checking up on us and refilling drinks as needed. 

I'd love to come back when it's cooler because the patio looks like a great place to dine and hang out. I'd probably skip for lunch next time though because I like being able to hear all the people I am eating with. ;p

The buffet itself consisted of a mix of various popular vegetarian and chicken based dishes. Such items included paneer tikka masala, chicken tikka masala, aloo tikki, chicken vindaloo, aloo gobi, and saag. There's a salad bar with various dressings, and a selection of carrot halwa, gulab jamun, and kheer/rice pudding for dessert. 

My favorite dish out of the buffet items was the aloo gobi. It had a great mix of flavor, and had large chunks of potato and cauliflower. The tikka masala dishes I tried were very heavy on the cream, and had a mild flavor. The chicken vindaloo, normally a very spicy dish, was probably about a medium level of spice.

Service was good. Dishes were taken away promptly and water was refilled as needed.

While other buffets might have more selection and better preparation, Nandini pares down the items to cut down on cost, and includes beverages to add more value for your dollar.",5,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Some family members were in town and since they had watched a movie called ""The Ramen Girl"" they wondered if we had any ramen places in Las Vegas.  Sora has been bookmarked for many months so that's where we stopped.

We each ordered a different ramen.  I got the spicy miso ramen (size large) and a diet Coke.  The ramen was delivered in a few minutes and it was very good.  The broth was rich, the chasu was very good, and the egg was perfectly cooked.   I added some extra seasoning from the table and this turned out to be a very filling late lunch/early dinner.  

As we were finishing, one family member asked if I wanted to try and order of dumplings.  Why not?  We got an order of gyoza and they were good.  The sauce served with them was outstanding!!

This little shop is a few doors down from the Tempe Improv and sells a lovely looking selection of cakes and Indian sweets in addition to chaat, Indian style pizzas and main entrees.

The interior of the restaurant is contemporary with wood paneled walls and a digital screen menu. We browsed through the selections before deciding on a chicken tikka and keema pizza with mango lassi. The lassis are in the dessert case and are premade in small little drink cups. They had a refreshing creamy tangy taste. I enjoyed the pizzas. The chicken tikka pizza was filled with chopped white meat chicken, a copious amount of cheese and a sprinkling of cilantro. The dough was light and crisp, a little thinner than naan. I tasted some of the keema pizza which was filled with spiced ground lamb. I loved the spices in the meat but the pizza was a little soggy due to all the oil accumulating on the bottom of the pizza.

I peeked at some other people's orders and the biriyani looked quite impressive so I will have to try that next time I'm here. The prices are reasonable and the food was tasty and made quickly. I will be back to try more dishes!",20,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,4,2011-05-01,1,1xqK-PSG20Dgq4rrbnUC3w,5,"A 5 star dining experience in every respect.  I was greeted at the podium by two lovely ladies who both expressed a hearty ""welcome back"" to me.  I was shown to my table which was one row in from the windows overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  The table was waiting for me.  There was just one chair and one place setting waiting.  

My server was Blake.  He had a great sense of humor, was helpful when I asked for a suggestion (later at dessert time), and he was there without hovering.  I noticed him approaching out of the corner of my eye when I was taking a photo and he just detoured to the next table.  When I was done, he came back.  He said I wouldn't want his hand in my photo.

I got the dégustation menu.  There was an amuse-bouche--a small tea cup with some red bell pepper soup and a pheasant croquette.  The soup was very tasty and the croquette was equally tasty.  A nice way to start.

Bread service is not the usual basket on the table.  A bus person comes around and gives you two types of bread.  This is one area that could use a little upgrading, but best not to fill up on bread so I give Picasso a pass on this point.

First course--lobster salad.  I enjoyed the taste of the ""salad"" and the plating was whimsically done.  This is really not a salad, but a dish with a mound of lobster and some micro greens, pear tomato halves, some tiny melon balls, and some whole pink peppercorns which was a delight to chew along with the salad.

Second course--One scallop on a mound of potato mousseline with a ring of veal jus.  There was one very thin, lightly fried potato slice that was bent and sticking up like a little covering for the scallop.  Excellent presentation.  The scallop was perfect!

Third course--Foie gras.  A superb piece of foie gras with some almond slices, roasted pistachio pieces (ground) and a small brioche with rhubarb filling.  The plating had one line of tangerine sauce connection the foie gras with the brioche.

Fourth course--I chose the Colorado rack of lamb.  It's not really a rack of lamb but rather was a think lamb medallion that I asked to be done rare and it was exactly the way it should be.  Again, the plating was impeccably done.

Dessert--What to get?  The dessert menu had 6 choices.  When Blake came by and I asked his advice, he pointed to two choices, both of which were at the top of my list.  He tipped the scale in favor of the chocolate truffle beignets.  Imagine three small round beignets filled with warm chocolate truffle, accompanied by peanut butter ice cream.  The ice cream was atop a small tart of rich creme that had some large pearl tapioca in it.  There was a small piece of crackled peanut butter by the tart.  This was an absolute fine ending to a wonderful meal.  Again I have to mention the plating.  This is what makes a dining experience like this memorable.

After dessert, you're given a small tray with 7 truffles.  Obviously this would be for two people.  Since I was by myself, I made the sacrifice and ate them all.  One was a miniature lemon meringue tart!  Heaven!

About the service.  There was one bus person and one waiter assigned to the tables in my area.  The bus person was always there refilling my iced tea, taking plates away, asking if I wanted more bread, always aware of the needs of each table.  When I was fidgeting with my camera bag when I first sat down, he came over and hooked it on one of those table hooks I think originally made to hold a woman's purse.  

A final note--during the meal a woman came by and greeted me and she said ""welcome back"" too.  Later I asked Blake if this was a common way of greeting guests as it was my first time at Picasso.  He said the computer had me listed as a repeat guest.  

On leaving, you're given a small box with 3 palmiers.  The box has the ubiquitous Picasso on it.  Dessert for tonight.

The dinner was hosted by ""Back of the House Brawl's"" Jolene Maninna and Chef Canteenwalla.  I made a reservation for the start time at 6:30 and got there a few minutes before.  

The back of the restaurant was reserved for the dinner.  A server brought me an iced tea and suggested I might want to sit on the patio until they were ready.  I was joined by two women with whom I shared the rest of the evening and proved to be most excellent company.

In a short time, we were invited indoors and we took our seats at a four seat high top.  The food in order of presentation consisted of:  mini muffalettas, chicken gumbo, stuffed artichoke, jambalaya, and Cajun crawfish boil.  For dessert, we were served king cupcakes and hot beignets.  All the food was very good with two standouts, the gumbo and the jambalaya.  The broth of the gumbo was very rich and the jambalaya had a good amount of andouille, shrimp, and chicken.  I am not a crawfish person but it was OK for one night to mess with these little creatures and suck out the small amount of meat each one provides.  My feeling is that any crawfish should be served out of shell in an étoufée.  

The king cupcakes did not have a baby baked in any of them out of fear that someone would swallow one while eating the cupcake too quickly.  At our table, we all used forks to eat the cupcakes just in case and then our server explained why there were none.  The beignets were delicious and served very warm.  Fresh was the word for sure!!

This was a fun two hours.  Served family style and getting a chance to eat with previous strangers, it was a marvelous Mardi Gras evening.  The stand out besides the food was the wonderful staff.  Our server was John.  He had a great personality, used our names when talking with us, and was on top of everything.  Other staff came by the replace serving plates or bring a basket with more mini muffalettas and everyone was in good form!

I hope Chef Canteenwalla continues special events like this.  The price was good, the food was great, and the entire evening was enjoyable and memorable.",10,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I really thought this dinner would be special but it wasn't.  I was the first person in the restaurant at 5:30.  I was seated by a bus person at a corner table where I was content to be.  The waiter with the French accent suggested I might want a better spot, but I was happy where I was.  The restaurant is made up of small rooms with intimate seating and low lighting.  It would be a romantic place to go.

I had a Groupon for $50 so I ordered off the à la carte menu.  I was brought  some slices of wonderful baguette with a small dish of butter.  Then came a basket, very large, of crudités.  Finally, a small plate with olives-both green and ripe.  The dijon dipping sauce for the vegetables was very tasty.  I only had a few pieces of zucchini so as not to eat too much before the meal.

The homemade terrine de foie gras was a bit of a disappointment.  I guess I was comparing to other foie gras I've eaten and this came up short.  I did like the presentation with the toast points, the separated dish with salt and pepper, the greens with some dressing, and the small amount of cranberry relish on the plate.

Next came the filet au poivre.  It was a bit too done for me.  I asked for it rare and it was somewhat rare, but I should have ordered it black and blue.  That was my error, not theirs.  The cracked pepper was great and the peppercorn sauce was excellent!  The pommes frites were a bit hard although they weren't over-browned.  There was a small broiled tomato slice with the steak.

For dessert, I pre-ordered the chocolate lava cake with the homemade vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  I took the waiter's suggestion because I was torn between that and the Grand Marnier soufflé.  The dessert was fantastic.  The waiter broke the top of the cake like one would a soufflé.  Some of the molten chocolate came out and lathered the sides of the cake.  He then added a scoop of the ice cream and topped it with the whipped cream.

Summary:  Although I was the first person there, it didn't seem like they were ready even though they opened a half hour before.  The bus person had to brew the iced tea which took awhile.  Since so many diners have wine, maybe this isn't a priority for them.  The bus person didn't bring sugar or artificial sweetener even though he asked me once if I wanted and I said yes.  10 minutes later, he realized he had forgotten and he asked me again.  It wasn't that busy.  

While the food was good, i expected so much more for the hype about this place.  I'm glad I tried it, but I'm not sure I'd return.",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

There were only two tables, including me, occupied most of the time I was in this small restaurant.  I knew it was a Kosher restaurant but I didn't understand the menu until I read Krista N.'s review.  (Thanks Krista!) 

I ordered the antipasti sandwich, a panini with grilled vegetables--eggplant, red peppers, mushrooms, and tomatoes--grilled in olive oil and Mediterranean spices--and topped with feta cheese.  The sandwich came with a small salad of iceberg lettuce with roasted red peppers and cucumbers.  I also got a cup of coffee.  It's Danesi Italian coffee.  

Service was good as it should have been with so few people in this small restaurant. I was not offered a refill on coffee which surprised me.  I agree with the others that the prices are high and I think I'll try one of the things I was going to get by going nearby and getting it at and adjoining restaurant.

I came here to meet two friends at the Griddle Cafe the morning they were open.  After breakfast, I took the time to roam the property and see the restaurant selection and make note of places I want to come back and try.  

The casino area was not very crowded until I was leaving because i had arrived so early.  The line for The Code--their slot club--was very long wqhen I left.  The casino is rather small compared to what it was when the hotel was the Sahara.   The emphasis here is less on gaming and more on food and entertainment.

The place has been nicely redone.  The porte-cochère is completely different and has a sculpture called SAM, for Philippe Starck's idea of Sam Nazarian.  It, along with much of the interior was designed by Starck.  He's not a fan of traditional Las Vegas slot machine toppers so he designed the faces that have tongues.  He also used Nazarian's girlfriend as a model for the entrance to Cleo.

The room is very nicely done.  I was at one of two tables along a wall that sat two people.  A server came to me and started explaining the specials having told me that my waiter wasn't yet there.  As the first one was explaining the specials, my server appeared.  The first one continued and then they let me study the menu.  In the meantime, a runner brought my iced tea.

I was set to have a steak but when I learned the pasta special for last night was orecchiette, that's what I ordered.  I ordered a small portion of calamari for an appetizer and I got a side of meatballs (2 small) with dinner.

Bread was brought to the table.  It was a nice selection of a cheese brea, salted bread sticks, and some crostini.  Instead of butter, Andiamo serves a very good eggplant caponata with olives for use on the bread bruschetta style.  

The calamari came quickly and it was a good sized plate even if it was a small order.  The marinara served with the calamari was quite good.

The orecchiette was fairly good.  It was a bit too al dente.  There were small cubes of meet and some peas in the orecchiette and the sauce was good.  It did need some salt.  The side of meatballs were good.  Again, the sauce was good.

The server pushed the dessert cart to my table and I went with a coconut cake.  There seemed to be a difference of opinion as to what it was.  My server said it was a lime, coconut cake and another server told the woman seated at the next table that it was Key lime pie.  Regardless, the fruit flavor was very light.

I had the spinach-ricotta ravioli with shrimp scampi and tried some of the grilled herb salmon and garlic rosemary chicken. The nice thing about Olive Garden is that your entrees will come with unlimited breadsticks, and soup or salad. Unfortunately the breadsticks we had tasted like they were a little old and had been reheated, with a hard, chewy crust at the ends. The salad tasted like it had also been made way ahead of time then spruced up a bit. The lettuce tasted wilted by the time we got it. I tried a bit of the pasta fagioli soup which was well seasoned and enjoyable so if I were to go here again I'd get soup instead of salad.

The entree I had was a generous portion of shrimp and ravioli. The shrimp was well cooked and very tender. The pasta was al dente but I wasn't a big fan of the filling. The whole thing was swimming in a puddle of yellow sauce. The salmon I tried was slightly overcooked for my tastes but I liked the grilled flavor of the chicken I had a bite of with the fresh rosemary it came with.

We used the tablet on our table to put in an order of zeppoli with raspberry sauce. They were kind of like a cross between a beignet and sopapilla. They had a lightly crisp outer layer, soft pillowy dough on the inside and were coated with a special type of very finely ground sugar. I didn't care too much for the raspberry sauce. It tasted like I was dipping my dessert in Smucker's jam.

You can also pay for your meal using the tablet with credit card and leave tip which makes it convenient.

Service was impeccable. Chris provided friendly, warm, and engaging service and was very attentive to our table.

You'd have to hear her say this with her delightful accent.  For my meal at Guy Savoy, I often thought of Christelle and silently said ""formidable!""

I got the Signature Menu, a multi-course meal of wonderfully prepared and plated food.  Dinner started with what could be called 3 amuse-bouches although only one was called the amuse-bouche.  Shortly after getting comfortable, a server brings you a metal skewer of foie-gras with black truffle.  In a bit, you're brought another morsel, a 2 piece waffle with parmesan cheese.  Then the ""official"" amuse-bouche arrives.  It's a small cup of zucchini soup with some pine nuts.  You brush the nuts into the soup.  My server, Kriste, suggested I check under the cup when I was done for something else.  Sure enough, there was a small piece of pork belly to enjoy when the main part was finished.

The first course was the chestnut course.  There was chestnut purée, small whole chestnuts, sliced mushrooms, and chestnut soup.  It was marvelous.  I haven't eaten chestnuts since I was a teen.  

The second course was called the Colors of Caviar--layers of caviar in different forms topped by a layer of caviar sabayon.  A server suggested inserting the flat spoon all the way down and getting some of each layer.  Very nice!

During this time, I had one piece of lemon bread from the bread cart.  You're automatically brought two pieces of bread after being seated and I didn't want to fill up on bread.  I have to go again and try the sea weed bread.  They had a very nice selection.

Course three was whole stuffed red mullet.  The head of the fish was discretely covered by a leaf of cooked spinach. The fish was stuffed with very thinly sliced mushrooms and spinach.  It was extraordinary!

Course four was Foie-gras with a bitter infusion.  They bring a glass tea pot with a candle to your table.  In the tea pot, green tea is placed and consomée is added.  The foie-gras is prepared in the kitchen as the infusion heats.  Then the foie-gras arrives and the infusion is poured around the dish.  You're all given a small glass of the infusion to enjoy after each bite.  The foie-gras was perfectly seared on top.

Course five was artichoke and black truffle soup served with a toasted mushroom brioche with black truffle butter.  The soup is completely water based--no cream or stock.  It's amazing how much flavor comes from the ingredients with just water!

Course six was beef tenderloin (with bone marrow on top)--done according to your wishes when you order your meal--with a carrot paleron cannelloni.  The beef was so tender and flavorful. The carrot cannelloni was quite tasty and a very clever concept.

Course seven was the cheese course.  There were many options on the cheese cart.  The cheeses were described very thoroughly.  I chose roquefort, a milder cheese from the Savoie region of France, and a more liquid, more full flavored cheese from the Loire Valley.  The plating is done in a way that the cheeses go from mildest to strongest or the other way around depending on where you start.  There's more bread here.  I got two slices, one of a fruit bread and one a nut bread.

Then came a palate cleanser of chopped blackberry with fresh apple pieces and a small spoon of cinnamon crumb cubes.

Course eight was the first dessert--Coconut six ways.  I can't remember all the ways but there was coconut soup, coconut granité, coconut soup, coconut tapioca, fresh coconut slices and one I don't remember.  Delightful!

Course nine was the second dessert--chocolate fondant, crunchy praline, and a chicory cream.  Rich chocolate, a tasty cream to dip your fondant in, and the crunchy praline was superb!  A great ending--almost.

Then the mignardises trolley was wheeled to the table.  There was such a large selection.  I made five choices, a stuffed grape, some jasmine marshmallow, a wonderful petit cheesecake, caramelized banana, and one other I don't remember.  I was on a food high!

Service was extraordinary!  Kriste, the main server, was always attentive and there were two others.  Between the three, there was always an eye on my table to make sure I had anything I needed.  Near the end of the meal, Chef Chartron stopped by my table and introduced himself and asked about how the meal was.  This is always a nice touch.  

Prior to dinner, Kriste gave me a tour of the restaurant including the Krug Room, one of only five in the world.  After dinner, she took me to the kitchen to speak with Chef Chartron and see the kitchen area.  Chef Chartron was working on a new menu and his chef's table had his papers on which he was writing his plans.  I found out there was a sub-kitchen two floors below and this is the finishing kitchen.

I do eat their loin of pork, the pepper chicken in the Asian section was great yesterday, and the pot stickers were good.  They have pork nuggets so you can put on your own sweet and sour sauce or Orange sauce which are in containers.

The one disappointment was they didn't have these melt away confectioner sugar coated cookies yesterday.  I really love those little critters.  There's nothing to them, and they almost melt in your mouth.  It's such a simple little cookie, but a dessert I look forward to getting.  They didn't have any yesterday!

The Italian ice was light and refreshing, contrasted with the thick, rich, and creamy custard. Ice flavors are plentiful, and they offer a sugar free option for those looking for a lighter dessert. Some examples included banana, pumpkin cheesecake, iced coffee, black cherry, and pineapple. There were various types of custard to choose from too, and a ""light custard"" version. Flavors included vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. 

The one negative is that weren't enough chairs when we were here on the weekend, and there is only one outdoor bench area (Already taken up by a family when we were here), so at busy times you might be forced to get your order to-go unless you want to stand while eating your dessert.",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

This time my wife and I came after a dance program for an early dinner.  In fact, we arrived just before 5 PM as they were setting things up for the evening's dinner service.  Tracy, our server, seated us and then went to get menus, dishes, and silverware.  While he was gone, Chef Marc came over and discussed the offerings for the night's menu.

By the time Tracy came back with the menus, I already knew what I was having but my wife needed time to decide.  We ordered a house salad to share.  The salad had an oil and vinegar dressing and it had a dollop of fresh ricotta to enjoy. I got the salmon special which was a beautiful piece of salmon seasoned beautifully and cooked perfectly.  The salmon was on a bed of garlic spinach and some homemade pappardelle dyed with cuttlefish ink.  Excellent pasta, too.  My wife got chicken marsala that came with a side of rigatoni with red sauce.  She enjoyed it and I tasted the sauce and it was quite flavorful

For desert, I asked Tracy about the size of the chocolate mousse cake and he said it was large and easily shared.  I was somewhat crestfallen because I wanted to enjoy one of the wonderful cannoli I had when I was here for the UYE.  I told Tracy I'd order some cannoli to take home if the cake didn't fill me up.  When he brought our cake, there was one of their small versions of cannoli as a complimentary treat--proof that you can have your cake and cannoli, too!  It was very much appreciated!

Tracy was an excellent server.  Chef Marc is passionate about his food and he's a joy to talk to.  I'm looking forward to our next UYE here so I can have another of his 5 course special meals he designs for the Yelp group.",10,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We were seated promptly. The menu had all sorts of appetizing items with a wide range of proteins and a few vegetarian options. I had the venison and tried some of the Korean fried chicken. The venison was superb, full of flavor and I loved the slight kick of spiciness from the ancho chile rub. It was cooked perfectly at medium rare, and very tender. It was served with roasted potatoes, creamed greens, and a date puree. The roasted potatoes were perfect, and while I enjoyed the taste of the creamed greens they were served in a rectangular brick form so it made me think they had served me a frozen box of spinach on a plate. The date puree had good flavor but I didn't like the grainy texture of it. The presentation was unique. It reminded me a little of the mountains along Papago Peak. I also tried some of the Korean fried chicken which had a wonderfully crispy skin and tender meat. There were some pieces that were slightly over seasoned though and a bit too salty for my tastes though.

Service was good and we were checked up on as needed.

We finished our meal with a lovely panna cotta with berry sauce and diced dragonfruit. I loved the creamy panna cotta with the texture of the dragon fruit and tangy addition of berry sauce. The orange peel on top was a good way to make the presentation look better, but the actual taste of it was tough and leathery. If it had more of a candied flavor it would have perfected the dessert.

Overall it was a fine meal and a good way to spend our evening in conjunction with the luminarias event.",18,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Is it healthy? Well, I suppose it's healthier than eating a burger, but do you notice that every salad has some sort of sugary dressing on it? Also, while the soups are tasty, most of them taste like they have a fair amount of cream in them.

I had the chance to take the tour with chocolate maker Chef Matt Piekarski.  His passion for making the finest chocolate comes through in his explanation of the process that starts with where the beans are purchased through the various processes to from from bean to chocolate in this small area of the Hexx chocolate store.

On the tour, you see where the beans are roasted, where the separation of bad beans takes place, and the separator that removes the outer shell and takes the cocoa bean and grinds it into chocolate nibs.

From here, the nibs are put in large, round mixers where the chocolate is mixed over a three day period.  After the liquid chocolate is put in molds, it's put in a small room on racks for cooling.  There is an amount of chocolate stored here also.

At the end of the tour, we had a sample of some of the dark and milk chocolates.

I purchased several bars and brought home.  It is some of the best chocolate I've tasted.  Depending on the chocolate percentage, the flavor of the chocolate will vary so I'm glad I got several varieties.  I also bought three red velvet cookies that my wife really, really enjoyed.

This is worth of stop when visiting Las Vegas or if you're a local.  You can arrange a tour also.  It';s not long but it's very informative.  You'll be amazed what's accomplished in such a small area.

They offer both a la carte and combination options, and there are a plethora of dishes to choose from. We decided on some 3 item combinations which include 2 scoops of rice. I had the chicken afritada, beef kare kare, and pork dinuguan, while I tried some chicken and pork adobo. The chicken afritada was a slightly sweet, tangy mixture with tomatoes, served with roughly chopped, bone-in dark meat pieces. The beef kare kare was a little murky tasting for me, with some indistinct earthy flavors muddled in with the sauce. The pork dinuguan was good, with tender pork and a rich vinegary taste. I probably liked the adobo out of all the dishes. It was a perfect blend of spices, textures, and flavors.

Service was speedy and efficient, as your dishes are already cooked and sitting in containers buffet style. A 3 item combination plate is around $10, and is a lot of food to eat. I took my meal to go and it lasted for 2 meals.

q4TSv7LWvUYTuZxy3-Tu4Q,24,2016-12-17,16,8QmeyjlCm6yBFHf7teO9Ng,4,"Fun fact: Drunken Tiger is the name of a famous Korean hip-hop band that made their debut in 1999.

Review 9/10 for the 10 bookmarked businesses to review before the end of 2016! From Meagan B.'s thread: https://www.yelp.com/topic/phoenix-yelp-phoenixs-10-firsts-of-2016

The menu at Drunken Tiger is fairly similar to its predecessor Cafe Agit with a few more bar food type foods thrown into the mix like nachos and fries. We ordered a ton of food, most of it some sort of fried chicken. The padak chicken had a light crispy batter with the requisite curly strips of green onion on top, served with a wasabi/horseradish soy sauce and a creamier sweet sauce. The popcorn chicken was essentially the same as the padak but with different dipping sauces (A sweet chile sauce and another creamy sauce). The grilled meats we had were the kalbi and spicy pork. The kalbi had a good marinade on it and had a nice proportion of meat on the platter. The spicy pork was tender, well seasoned and I liked how it actually delivered on the spiciness level unlike other Korean restaurants where there is barely a whiff of chile pepper in their ""spicy"" marinated grilled meat.

I did make a special request for bulgolgi fries which were essentially the fries version of their bulgolgi nachos. The fries had a light crispness, smothered in gooey cheese and topped with olives, pico de gallo, jalapeños, and chopped up bulgolgi. It tasted great overall and was a huge portion but I do wish I could taste a little more of the bulgolgi flavor and meat in the meal. 

We also ordered some seafood pancake which was generously filled with seafood, with a crispy crust to contrast with the softer textures of the filling. 

Our Bizarre Foods moment came when someone ordered the silkworm soup. It came out piping hot, and had a weird funky aroma to me. I figured hey, I'll try almost anything once so why not try this? I was handed two silkworms on my plate. I examined them and tried to ignore the fact that they looked like something that I pay an exterminator to get rid of every month. The actual broth they were ""cocooned"" in was bold and fiery. I bit into a corner of a silkworm to find it was too chewy and chitinous for my tastes so I just ended up swallowing them whole like a bitter pill, following each swallow with a copious amount of soju. Even though I wasn't really a fan of the soup I appreciate that they offer this dish to those that do enjoy it!

Now the soju... It was served in a gigantic hollowed out watermelon, blended with fresh watermelon pulp and juice, topped with Fruity Pebbles and Pop Rocks. Truly a sight to behold and a combination that makes you wonder if someone had been on a mind-bending substance while thinking of this drink (Or maybe they had eaten too many silkworms that day). I liked the fresh watermelon but I don't think there was a lot of soju in the actual drink since I was feeling barely anything after a few rounds.

There was a mix up as we were initially served a regular bulgolgi plate instead of the fries, and I did have to remind the server about a missing drink order, but the server was apologetic and provided friendly service. 

The interior seems pretty much the same was Cafe Agit, with various TV screens either playing a game or K-Pop.

Overall I think this a great option for late night eats or if you want Korean food for dinner. There were a good number of people seated here on a Friday night having conversations in Korean which is always a good sign that the food and beverage here is legit. We had a good time and I'll be back again for more food!",26,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We were in the shopping plaza Saturday and had already eaten but saw the large Grand Opening banner and peeked inside to see what this cafe was like. After looking at the menu we knew we had to check it out for breakfast the next day.

This little restaurant serves up a mix of Filipino and American foods. The all-day Filipino breakfast menu is up on the chalkboard while there is a rotating daily menu of breakfast, lunch, and dinner dishes on a clipboard near the register to look at. We decided on the tapsilog and tocilog ($7.99 each). We also shared some vegetable eggrolls.

The interior is cute, with sunny warm accents and a contemporary feel. On the counter there are various pastry items, both Filipino style and American, if you're looking for more of a quick bite.

Our orders were nicely presented, and had a good amount of meat and rice to them. Both the tapsilog (Marinated sliced beef) and the tocilog (Marinated, cured pork slices) had rich, deep, earthy flavor in every bite. I was slightly disappointed that the I couldn't taste more of the garlic in the sinangag (Garlic fried rice). We also received one egg instead of the two that were advertised on the menu. The egg was cooked perfectly to order at least (We requested over easy). There was a small bowl of papaya salad (atchara) that went well with the meal.

The vegetable egg rolls were 4 to an order and were fried to a lovely golden brown color. They tasted decent, although the filling tasted slightly mushy to me.

Service was friendly.

I also tried some lomo saltado and some bites of a another steak dish (Sorry I forgot the name). The beef was expertly seasoned and very tender. 

Service was decent. One little snafu for the restaurant was that they were completely out of soda, saying that the soda delivery truck hadn't come yet. Still, we did enjoy the chicha morada instead.

Oxtail empanadas with lime crème fraîche
Soft pretzel bread with spicy beer mustard

Red velvet waffle sliders
Hangar steak tartar
Crispy fried pig ears with truffle honey mustard sauce
Roasted cauliflower with dates and yellow curry
Cast iron s'mores with semi-sweet chocolate and bacon marshmallows
Crumbled carrot cake

Greeted by the general manager, Chuck Scimeca, we were quickly seated and brought water and I ordered an iced tea.  We were asked if we wanted to order items from the menu or have the chef send out items he chose.  After looking at the menu, we opted for them to make the choices for us but we had a few requests--items they had already planned for us to have.  During our dinner, Chef Daniel Ontiveros, formerly at Comme Ça, came to the table to talk about some of the dishes and his plans for the menu in the future.  I saw him several times stopping at tables to chat with customers.

Outstanding dishes were the gnudi--baked ricotta, truffle honey, fig jam, roasted almonds & cranberry and walnut crostini.  The jam and almonds with the baked cheese on the crostini was excellent!  The Mexican street corn was very good.  I'll go for this anytime.  The assorted mushroom flatbread was very different.  Instead of being a standard flatbread crust, it was instead a puff pastry crust.  The char on the pastry was perfect without being burnt.  The soft cooked egg mixed onto the flatbread added to the flavor of the mushrooms and bacon.  The last two items were ones we asked for and were good choices.  The baked cauliflower with China Ranch dates and yellow curry was excellent!  The light curry flavor was very good.  Finally, the pig ears were so much different than others I've had.  These were meatier instead of being a thin slice of pig ear.  The honey mustard dipping sauce with them was very tasty.

The two desserts were quite good.  The s'mores with bacon marshmallows on top of a graham cracker crust in the cast iron container was a fun dish--a perfect example of Chef Ontiveros's slant on a dish that's available in area restaurants--this with a very different twist.  The favorite, however, was the crumbled carrot cake served with cream cheese frosting and a spoon of vanilla ice cream.

Service during the evening was excellent.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass before I  was done with the previous and the servers were all pleasant and efficient.  One negative for me--the music was loud at times and it almost overwhelmed our conversation.  Therapy. is very close to being a five star review. 

We were not presented a check.  The servers were taken care of instead.

Since it was a sunny warm day I went with an almond milk latte and tried some vanilla frappe. The latte was refreshing with smooth, rich flavored espresso with a chocolatey undertone.

The frappe was also very refreshing, with more of a blended smoothie feel and a good balance of vanilla and coffee flavors.

My husband thought it smelled like a fish market, which is a tad better than my first thought, that it smelled kind of sewer-like.  Maybe it was due to the location of the restaurant, since it is right next to the man-made lake in Chandler.  Undaunted by our olfactory caution though, we headed in with a mission to use our Groupon and gorge on sushi.

Hon Machi itself serves up OK sushi, nothing too spectacular, although they do have an interesting selection of rolls to choose from.  Go here to get cheap sushi and appetizers, especially during happy hour, or to pig out on all you can eat sushi on Sunday and Monday nights (~$20 per person, limited selection).  We decided to go a-la-carte, and got a few rolls, and hamachi collar as an appetizer.

The timing was a bit off, since we got our more basic rolls first, while our appetizer actually came out with the 2nd set of rolls we had ordered.  I've never tried hamachi/yellowtail collar before, so I can't really gauge its quality compared to other restaurants, but here the fish was tender with good flavor.  

The rolls themselves were just OK.  We got a selection of spicy salmon, spicy tuna tempura, and soft shell crab.  My favorite was the soft shell crab, and the least favorite was the tuna tempura because the rice ended up tasting gummy and mushy.  

Service was good.  Our waitress was very attentive and constantly filled our iced teas as needed.

The pizza was decent. It had a lightly crisp crust and puffy soft dough. It tasted about what you'd expect for a pizza buffet.

There were a lot of kids here since families were invited to the shindig, and they all seemed to enjoy the limitless pizza, soda and ice cream. 

The star of the show is of course the pipe organ and organ player. Our organ player was Lew Williams who did an admirable job playing various songs by memory and even took requests from the audience. He played Christmas songs, a lot of Mary Poppins songs, some Disney, and the obligatory Phantom of the Opera numbers.

I've actually been trying to cut down on my meat intake anyways and decided to try Volstead out. The name is interesting, it brings to mind similar sounding names with ""Vol"" in the title. If I am in a silly mood perhaps I will eat at Volstead while listening to Volbeat after test driving a Volkswagon one of these days!

I tried out the Copper State sandwich and a regular size iced latte with coconut milk. The sandwich comes with a side- I went with the kale and cranberry salad. The sandwich was excellent. The bread was lightly toasted and provided a lovely textural crunch with the soft gooey cheese and diced green chiles. The flavors were a perfect complement to each other. The salad was fresh, but underdressed and thus a bit bland to me. 

The latte was smooth and rich, with a chocolaty undertone.

I wanted a healthy bite to eat for lunch so I stopped by Picazzo's and tried their new Buddha quinoa bowl. It is a salad/grain bowl with ingredients such as spinach, arugula, rainbow quinoa, avocado, roasted sweet potatoes, slivered almonds, shrimp, and coated with a cumin vinaigrette. That's quite a lot going on in a salad! I requested it with no feta. 

The bowl came out and looked amazing. The colors and overall look was bright and fresh, and the bowl came with a slice of delightful focaccia bread. I think it was gluten free too. 

Overall I enjoyed the different textures and flavors of the vegetables with the quinoa. The sweet potato was for the most part sweet and roasted, although there were a couple pieces that were more ""al dente"" and a little less cooked. The shrimp in the bowl were plentiful and well cooked but were too aggressively seasoned for my tastes. I also thought the cumin flavor was too assertive in the vinaigrette and tended to overpower the rest of the flavors in the bowl. I'd either use a different spice or use less cumin in the dressing if I were to make this bowl on my own. Most of the greens were fresh, but I did pick out a yellow spinach leaf out of my salad portion of the meal.

Service was friendly and swift. It was a warm sunny day so I indulged in the spacious patio outside while eating my lunch.

Even after 7 years Picazzo's is still a pretty good place to eat! Stop by for some organic fresh meals.

I've driven by Go Wild a number of times and I've seen their ad saying 50% off all rolls, all day, every day.  I generally shy away from places that may increase prices only to offer 50% off, but after reading the Yelp reviews, I decided to give Go Wild a try.

I ordered two rolls--the baked Langostino lobster on a California roll and the Kiss of Fire.  The menu describes the baked langostino roll as baked baby lobster, mushroom with dynamite sauce on Cali roll and the Kiss of Fire as Inside-Shrimp tempura, spicy shrimp, cucumber. Ouside-spicy soft shell crab, albacore, jalapeno topping, extra spicy ponzu sauce.

Both were excellent.  The presentation was great as any good sushi place should have.  The flavors of the lobster mixed with the California roll was very good.  The Kiss of Fire was aptly named.  It had spicy seasonings that gave it that kiss of fire, well a small fire.  I found that the rolls were so good the way they were that I used no soy sauce but merely used the wasabi.  I almost finished the portion they brought and almost asked for more so I could make more fire for myself.  As another reviewer said, they use a small amount of rice.  There isn't a huge amount used to make the roll look bigger than it is or to take the place of other ingredients.  

I had a few more rolls on my to try list, but I decided not to pig out but stop at the two and have some dessert.  I got an order of tempura red bean ice cream.  It was a pleasant ending to a good meal.  There were three servers circulating through the restaurant that wasn't very busy.  They were attentive and even after bringing the check, asked me if I wanted another iced tea.

I really liked the decor of the restaurant.  I'm not a fan of sitting at sushi bars, I've come to learn, so I sat at a table.  The music was reggae--odd for a sushi house--and the big screen TV had ESPN's Sports Nation.  It's amazing how good ESPN is when to you don't have to listen to a word of the drivel they're saying.  The TV was on mute so I watched the plays they were chatting about and tapped my feet  to the music.

And those that do go get Sichuan style food :) Located in the same shopping plaza as the Super L, Szechuan Palace specializes in chile and peppercorn laden dishes that turn up the heat and tingle your senses. The use of the fragrant, almost floral tasting peppercorn not only adds flavor but it numbs your tongue.

We ordered the Chongqing chicken (boneless), water boiled fish and dry saute green beans. The chicken and fish had the requisite spicy, salty bold punch to them and my tongue was numb in seconds after eating it. I was glad we ordered some sauteed green beans because it helped provide a tongue numbing break in between spicy bites. While the chicken and fish provided the spicy kick I wanted, the flavors weren't as developed as other restaurants I've been to (Such as the sadly defunct Miu's). The chicken and fish were tender though, and overall enjoyable. The green beans were perfectly seasoned and cooked perfectly. We finished the plate in a record amount of time.

The restaurant was fairly busy when we came for dinner around 8 on a Thursday.

c-NXKTJ0jrrusTPxJAUwvA,4,2015-03-04,7,-OV8ESXrSbI2JrBmfjjlOw,2,"The food was good but the service was very poor and odd at times.  This was our first visit to Red Robin.  Since we live less than a 1/2 mile away, this was a chance to try one of the newer food places in Downtown Summerlin.  You never get a second chance to make a first impression. 

We were semi-greeted when we walked in when an employee reached below the podium and got two sets of menus and finally gestured us to follow him.  I don't recall him saying a word to us.

Our server came to the table promptly and seeing his name tag, I said good afternoon *name*.  He responded with, ""Hi, I'm *name* and I'm going to be your server.  He was trained to introduce himself and give his name and by damn he was going to do it even though I had already spoken to him by name.  Odd.

He took our drink orders and soon brought two iced teas to the table.  We asked for time to study the menu more and when he came back we were ready to order.  He had also given me a card to text a word to a number to join Red Robin's reward program.  (He has seen me using my iPhone as I was checking into Yelp).

My wife ordered the soup and sandwich combo.  She got a cup of Red's Chili Chili and a BLTA croissant.  I ordered a cup of chicken tortilla soup and a Burnin' Love burger.  *name* asked me if I wanted my soup with my burger or before.  I answered before.  After not too long, I was surprised when two dinners were brought and I had received no soup.  Oh well, to err is human and I forget a lot, too.  No big deal.

My wife enjoyed her sandwich and really liked the chili.  My burger was topped with a grilled jalapeño that was very good and was a hot one.  There were ""jalapeño coins"" and the burger was on a jalapeño kaiser roll.  There was also chipotle aioli on the burger.  With all this talk about peppers and burnin' love, the only spicy thing was the actual grilled jalapeño.  The burger was good and I liked the fries.  Since they were bottomless steak fries, I wanted to get some more and to get an iced tea refill.  *name* never came back to see how things were.  I finally flagged him down and asked for more fries and iced tea.  Since there were people at three other tables, *name* could be forgiven for being overwhelmed with the work.

I finished my burger before my extra fries were brought and I had moved my plate to the center of the table to make room for the fries.  When they were brought, *name* removed the two plates from the center taking with him my fork I was going to use with my fries.  Instead, I used one of our large toothpicks to eat some fries until they cooled enough to pick up with my fingers and eat.

Before we were finished with our meal, *name* stopped by to see if we wanted to dessert.  I said back off in a nice manner.  When finished, *name* came back and we ordered the mountain high mudd pie.  The dessert was quite good but once again *name* had a way of irritating me.  *name* brought our check while we were enjoying dessert and rather than just folding the two sides closed and leaving it on the side of the table with the no hurry message, *name* insisted on leaving the check holder unfolded and almost forced it under my right elbow as I was eating dessert.  I picked it up, slapped the two sides together, and put it to my left out of the way.  Before we were finished, *name* came back to pick up the check.  I waved him off.  When we were finished, I looked at the check and sure enough, charged for soup I didn't get.  I pointed this out to *name* and told him he never brought the soup.  He just stared at the check and then walked away never saying sorry I forgot or anything else.  He brought the check back and he once again insisted on pushing the opened check holder under my right elbow.  *name* just doesn't learn.

I paid the check and we left.  My rating for Red Robin would have been a three.  The food is not bad and I enjoyed it.  Service is what brought it down.  *name* needs some retraining.  You've been open long enough to have this correct.  One thing, they won't have to worry about a free burger on my birthday.  I won't be redeeming that reward.

Had lunch here with the delightful Haneen O. We both had never tried out this place before but we excited to eat here based on the reviews. I decided to go veg for lunch and got the vegetarian combo which includes 3 falafel, baba ganoush, hummus, tabbouleh, grape leaves, and pita bread. It was a ton of food! It was also served to me seemingly in the blink of an eye it was that fast. My favorite part of the plate was the baba ganoush. It had a deep smoky flavor and had a more neutral taste vs. super acidic/lemony versions I've had at other restaurants. The hummus with smooth and well balanced, the tabbouleh fresh with a light lemon flavor, and the falafel had an intriguing flavor due to the incorporation of whole coriander in the filling.

As if my mountain of food weren't enough, they were nice enough to give us free baklava at our table. I was so full I ended up taking it home, but I thought it was really well executed when I finally ate it. The layers were crisp, buttery/flakey, and the filling wasn't too sweet.

The one major negative for me at least was that this small space doesn't get really good ventilation so it felt really warm to me when we were dining here. There was A/C but it didn't seem to be circulating throughout the whole restaurant well.

For an appetizer, two of us shared the 1/2 pound of shrimp on a sizzling granite stone.  The shrimp were tiny things, but tasty.  The dipping sauce was quite good, but the shrimp could have used some more spicing.  One had a Caesar salad that was very good, perhaps the best dish of the evening.

Knowing our hiking group, going somewhere for lunch after hiking is not a hard sell at all so we put this on our to do list.

We got there before they opened at 11 AM.  As soon as they opened, the 9 of us were shown to a long table in the main room with high, arched ceiling.  The set up consists of long wooden benches at long wooden tables.

Our server was Angela and she was terrific!  First drinks.  I got iced tea and my tea along with others who had been or soda were brought quickly.  Our orders were then taken.  I wanted to get something somewhat German.  My only experience with German food had been at Luchows in New York City many years ago.  I was never overly fond of German food despite it being half my heritage.  I got the wurstplatte, a sampling of three German sausages--a Vienna style frank, and one pork and one chicken sausage.  They were served on a bed of mashed potatoes topped with sauerkraut and served with a spicy onion mustard.

The sausages were OK--nothing outstanding--but OK.  The sauerkraut on top of the mashed potatoes was something knew for me but the two went together well.  I was surpirsed at how much of the mustard was gone when I was finished with the sausages.  Maybe I overdid it a bit so the sausages had a bit more flavor?

I was the only one to get dessert.  I got the Black Forest cake at Angela's suggestion and this was so good that it would be reason to stop in here sometime when I wanted a good dessert.  Creamy and very flavorful, it was a perfect ending to the meal.  And, the hiker who suggested we come here was the only one who got a taste of my dessert.  My question to the Hofbrauhas is, ""Why serve this piece of cake with 4 forks?  Do you think I'm going to share?""  No way!!

While we were deciding on our dishes, the waitress brought out a little snack for us to nosh on. Our snack was roasted, dried, salted corn kernels that you could dip in two different sauces. Both sauces were spicy, piquant, with powerful strong flavors that went well with the earthy taste of the roasted corn.

We ended up getting the Lomo Saltado and the Picante a lo Tumi. The Lomo Saltado was tasty, with tender beef, fries and rice. The beef was piled on top of the fries, so the fries soaked up the gravy and juices from the beef, making it quite flavorful.

The Picante a lo Tumi seafood dish had great flavor. The scallops and shrimp were a bit overcooked though.

In both our dishes, the rice was fluffy and tasted great with the meals.

For dessert, we ordered the flan. It was a little overcooked, as the edges of it tasted burnt.

Our pitcher of chicha morada was delicious. This purple concoction had a slightly sweet, slightly tart, refreshing light taste.

Service was speedy and friendly.

While I might not get the seafood again since it was $16 and a bit overcooked, I'd definitely come here to get their other dishes such as the lomo saltado.

The server turned to a young man who translated for me.  Gracias #1.  After getting my diet Coke and while waiting for my pupusas, a woman at an adjoining table asked me if I really wanted one to eat there and one to take home.  When I said no, she sent her son to tell the server the error and the correction was made.  Gracias #2.

While waiting, she brought my slaw and tomato sauce.  All the while I enjoyed the complimentary chips topped with a tomato sauce and cotija cheese.  They were very good and I almost finished the basket before I left.

Soon the server brought my two pupusas--one cheese and loroco and one cheese and pork.  I heaped the slaw on top both and squeezed the tomato sauce onto these hot goodies.  They were excellent!  

Time was getting to be a factor.  I Googled menu in Spanish on my phone but by the time the server came back, rather than ask for a menu, I remembered flan and that I can say.  That's what I ordered and it was very good, too!

My server was a delightful young woman with a great smile.  My problem with her was that she was having a good time with the young guys at the next table and that was the cause for my time constraint.  I also think she had a hard time dealing with my lack of Spanish.

Next time I go, I'll do one of two things--take one of my Spanish speaking friends from Yelp or mark things down from the menu and just hand them the paper with my order, gabacho that I am.

The show starts with Newton singing three songs before doing a number where he does a guitar solo in the middle.  After that, he introduces his wife, and we are treated to video of Newton with famous entertainers from years gone by like Dean Martin, Jack Benny, and Sammy David Jr. to name a few.

Much of the information I knew because we're of the same generation.  Some of it was new.  True, Newton doesn't have the voice he had years ago.  We all lose some of our abilities as we age.

I was pleased by the show and it's evident why Newton became known as Mr. Las Vegas.  Hats off to him for all his work over the years entertaining civilains and troops alike and many thanks for all the USO tours and work.

The show is in Bally's Windows Showroom on the 2nd floor and it's listed as a limited engagement.",13,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
HJLiVxuvtN0n73BASSZKoQ,24,2017-03-25,15,07qfqsu4R2zCKBT6eyqlYQ,3,"Halal Guys was decent. This chain sells basically fast food Middle Eastern dishes. The menu is limited to chicken, gyro and falafel as your base to go in either sandwich or platter form. 

I went with the small size falafel platter. Half of it was filled with iceberg lettuce salad, and the other half was filled with seasoned rice. 4 small falafel pieces were placed on top along with a few pieces of pita triangle. You have your choice of add ins (I added onion, jalapeno, and olive) and you will also have your choice of white, hot, or BBQ sauce. I went with white and hot sauce. 

Overall, I wasn't too impressed. For $8 I would have liked something additional to go with the pita triangles, such as a scoop of hummus or baba ganoush. The falafel pieces were pretty small, rock hard on the outside, with a slightly moist filling. The falafel looked mass-produced as if they came from a mold since they had more of a gumdrop rather than spherical shape. For a platter filled only with inexpensive salad+rice with tiny falafel and few pita triangles I think it was definitely overpriced. 

My husband had the gyro sandwich which he said was pretty good. The gyro meat didn't look like your typical thinly sliced meat from a spit. It was more like small chunks of meat, and he said it was well seasoned and tender.

As for the sauces, I liked the white sauce with its mild creamy flavor and the red hot sauce packed quite a punch! 

If I go here again I'll skip on getting the falafel and will probably try one of the sandwiches.",23,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The citrus used to create the ceviche was excellent.  It was tangy and gave the shrimp a good flavor.  The pieces of shrimp were small in size.  The tostadas came with two lemon sections for extra citrus flavor.  The waiter also brought a bottle of Tapatío without asking.  Great!

Service was very good if not too good.  I was going to get something for dessert but when he noticed I was finished, he brought the bill over and said, ""No hurry.  I'll take that when you're ready.""  OK!  So I was off to the Mirage for a show and I stopped in my neighborhood for a Baskin-Robbins.  Their loss.

1/2 portion poke furikake style
Chicken katsu and kalua pig mixed plate
Kalbi short ribs and shrimp mixed plate
Roast pork loco moco
1 musubi 
Banana bread pudding
Chantilly cake
Guava cake
Haupia cake
Kona coffee mudd pie

There were three standouts in the savory items ordered--kalua pig, kalbi short ribs, and roast pork loco moco.  I've been a fan of kalua pig and this did not disappoint.  The meat was juicy and flavorful.  The short ribs were grilled perfectly with the meat being very juicy.  I thought the marinade was a little sweet and I didn't care for the flavor of the small container of sauce we got in a small container.  The loco moco was good as far as the pork was concerned and the gravy was good.  There was just so much rice that everything else got lost in the rice.

The two combination plates we got both came with two large scoops of rice and one large scoop of macaroni salad.  There was just an overwhelming amount of rice.  The macaroni salad was quite good.

I enjoy poke but this was different than other poke I've had.  The tuna was crunchy in texture and not soft like other times I've gotten poke.  I don't know which is the way it's supposed to be.  The furikake flavors were good.  I'd skip the musubi.  A whole lot of rice with only a small piece of spam inside.  

For the sweet items, we got smiles from the server when we started ordering.  At one point he said, ""You do know we have large portions?""  With a laugh, our order continued until we had four slices of cake and a banana bread pudding.  Standouts here were the banana bread pudding and the guava cake.  My favorite was the guava cake.  The Haupia was nothing special and the chantilly was a bit disappointing.  Understand that I would not turn down any of these if offered to me, but I wouldn't order those.  I found the Kona coffee mud pie disappointing.  Stick with the guava.

Now I know why my friend, Candace C, says in her review that ...""this is grubbing, stick-to-your-ribs, need-to-wear-pants-with-­elastic-band-before-­coming kind of food.""  Service was OK.",13,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

First of all, my server, Jenny, was an absolute delight.  She asked me about being there before and if I had any questions about the menu.  She was very helpful and very personable.  I was the only customer on this slow Sunday evening, and she had extra time and she spent it checking back with me a chatting.

I had looked at the menu online and I opted to try the bao.  I've never had Vietnamese bun bao so this was a new experience.  I ordered the duck and pork belly bao.  The duck bao comes with thinly sliced cucumber pieces, scallion, micro greens, and hoisin sauce.  The pork belly bao comes with one side of the pork seared, pickled mustard greens, cilantro, hoisin sauce, and some crushed peanuts.

The sandwiches were great!  The duck was my favorite because I simply love duck.  Jenny had brought me Sriracha and a small plate for putting the Sriracha and then using the plate as a dipping area.  It worked quite well!  The bun was very tasty.

Then the option came for dessert.  What's a person to do?  Ask Jenny for advice and certainly follow it.  I got the peanut butter cup which has a chocolate cookie-like bottom, then a layer of peanut butter mousse (my words), topped by some bits of crispy pieces.  I got it à la mode with vanilla ice cream.  The peanut butter is excellent.  Soft, creamy, and very rich!  I'm a fan--big time!

The restaurant uses the app Wallet so you can pay without pulling out the plastic and they'll email you a receipt if you want.  

The only drawback for me was the smell of smoke.  The restaurant is open to this small, locals casino and there's a smell of stale smoke as soon as you come in the door from the outside.  This permeates the restaurant and detracts from the overall experience.  I wish they'd put up some doors after scrubbing the place down and trying to get rid of the smoke smell.  But, I will be back.  Even though it's a small menu, there are things to try!",18,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
0NgePUfXd2TG0kWgsQRq0A,0,2006-02-12,0,lrACIwGwQvaJTZD5B8dYyQ,4,"YC's is great in that you control the taste of your food.  The downside of that however, is that if you don't make a good flavorful combination, you're stuck with it (unless you go buffet-style).  At YC's they have a standard price for a bowl of stir-fry, but for an extra dollar you can have it all-you-can-eat.  The price they charge for a bowl includes drink and dessert, which is nice.  Unless you haven't eaten in days, I would recommend sticking to the single bowl since that is more than enough food for one person. 

They have a pretty wide selection of meats, such as beef, pork, chicken, and turkey.  At dinnertime they bring out cod.  I do wish they had shrimp as one of the stir-fry ingredients though, since they have such a limited selection of seafood.  YC's has a good selection for vegetarians too, since they have a wide array of vegetables, and have tofu for those wanting a little more protein in their meal.  

For those that prefer rice over noodles, they have white rice and brown rice at the counter where the soda fountain is.  They also have soup at the counter.

Once you've stuffed yourself silly with your own tasty concoction of stir-fry, you can head over to the ice cream machine for some soft-serve.  If you can't finish your meal, they do have take-out boxes, but they charge a small fee for them (a dollar I think).",0,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I was surprised when some trashed it so much, so I was glad when MGM Resorts announced they were closing the buffet and re-doing it.  Yesterday I had the chance to try it since the redo.

It's basically the same place with a few modest changes and perhaps the addition of a few stations.  First the good--the prime rib was cooked nicely with it being a nice red rare.  The vegetable korma in the Tandoori section was quite good.  The chicken tikka masala was OK, but it needed more spice.  The seafood gumbo was quite nice.  I wish I had noticed the basmati rice in the tandoori section first.  I would have put some rice in the bowl and then added the gumbo.  The cheese bar was very nice with some dried fruit with the cheese.  The desserts were outstanding!!

A few lesser dishes.  The bao sandwich was not good at all.  The lovely steamed roll had dried hard from sitting warming for however long it was there.  The pork in the bun was kind of bland making this a fail choice.  There were some different bread selections but not a wide range to choose from.  The chicken satay was merely OK.  The peanut sauce was way too runny and didn't have a lot of flavor.  When you're paying $36.74 for dinner buffet, the shrimp should be PEELED.  I didn't have any because this is an onerous task for me.

Now the desserts.  While there was nothing exotic or earth shaking, they had some very nice small desserts.  I'm a sucker for meringue cookies and they had a fruit flavored one.  It was delightful!  I also had two of their mini whoopie cookies--one a snowball (chocolate cake with coconut) and one made from red velvet.  The cream filling was very good.  The gelato selection is good and I had the Oreo gelato.  Nice and creamy.

This isn't a buffet to which I'd likely return.  For the price, there are better buffets on the Strip with some very good selections.  Also for the price, I think I'd pay a little more and eat at one of Aria's fine selection of restaurants!",8,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

There was a nicely seasoned, tender corned beef brisket on the bottom of the dish, with 2 perfectly poached eggs on top.  A crispy plate of hash browns was served on the side, and it also came with some fresh baguette-style toast.  It tasted quite good, however, the menu stated that it should have come with roasted red pepper.  After searching on my plate, I found the tiniest sliver of red pepper on the dish.  They are really cutting corners here (jk)!

Fast, fresh, and healthier than other fast food restaurants, they offer Asian style entrees such as rice bowls, noodle soups, and sushi. In addition to preset menu items, you can create your own bowl with a plethora of options.

I opted for the green curry shrimp bowl. It was made in a fairly speedy amount of time, with nicely cooked skewered shrimp. There were a lot of fresh vegetables to go with the shrimp, as well as a generous mound of rice underneath the protein and vegetables. While the vegetables and shrimp themselves tasted OK, I wasn't a big fan of the actual sauce. It tasted too one-dimensional to me, with too much of a sour taste. 

There is a self serve soda fountain with a great selection of iced teas on the side as well. 

Overall, a decent place to dine. I probably won't get the green curry again, but I'd be willing to try other items that they have.",3,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Shrimp tempura
Crab cake
Perfect poutine
Steakhouse salad
Buttemilk fried chicken
New York steak Supreme Oscar
Hash brown
AuGratin potatoes
Mushrooms
Cream corn
Chocolate soufflé
Cheesecake

All items were shared except for the onion soup.  Another one was prepared because of the difficulty in sharing soup.  The bread basket had a good selection of different breads. Standouts for me were the shrimp tempura, New York steak Supreme Oscar, and buttermilk fried chicken.  Fried chicken is probably one of the three things I would never order eating out.  I was surprised by how good this fried chicken was.  It had a crispy fried skin and it was juicy inside.  The New York steak Oscar was served with an excellent béarnaise sauce with lobster and asparagus pieces.  It was delightful.  The shrimp tempura is a great dish for any table to share.  The pieces of fried shrimp was accompnaied by spicy yuzu mayo.  Finally, the perfect poutine consisted of French fries with duck confit gravy, crispy duck skin, and Maytag blue cheese.  It was very good.

We moved to the patio for dessert and I got to try only three of them as I had to leave to get to UNLV for a play.  The cheesecake was outstanding!  The chocolate soufflé was well executed and the carrot cake was delicious.

I still wish there was a curtain separating this elegant dinging space from the TVs at the bar/lounge area.  At the beginning of our meal, there was a fair amount of casino music that permeated the space.  Later, this was changed to in house music and the casino sound ebbed.

E0YuuRpK_4RpaUF7JK3mhg,7,2014-03-08,2,NYLijEdQdIRo84bqC51fww,5,"*** Review is for Spring 2014 Restaurant Week Menu ***

I enjoyed my dinner at Bacio when Chef Pellegrino was there and I've wanted to try Bratalian since she opneed the place.  I'm glad I did.

Since I was alone, I opted to sit at the bar.  Besides not taking up a table meant for two or more, I often have a good time watching the bartenders do their thing.  In this case, I had a direct view into the small kitchen of this restaurant and I could see Chef Pellegrino's sister, Chef Alessandra Madeira, cooking with her staff.  The kitchen seemed to run well and there were some laughs coming from there.  They were also putting out a good number of meals.  There were several take out orders called in while I was there.

The three course Restaurant Week menu has a lot of choices.  For the starter, I chose the Polpette Tradizionale--two 6 ounce meatballs made with beef, pork, and veal in a fresh tomato and basil sauce.  What a large starter.  That could have been the meal.  The sauce was very good and the meatballs were soft in texture and had an excellent flavor.

For the main course, I chose the Salsicce and Pepperoni--Italian sausage, both hot and sweet, sautéed over red and yellow peppers and onions.  Another winning dish.  The onions and peppers were sautéed just enough to start to soften them but not enough to take some of the crispness away and turn them to mush.  The pieces of sausage were cooked nicely and were very tasty.  It was different to have the sausage served in bite sized pieces and I liked the main course a whole lot.  I did let some of the peppers go.  Can't fill up on fiber!

For dessert, I had ordered then Torta di ricotta--classic Italian ricotta cheesecake.  After having had ricotta cheesecake at several Italian restaurants recently, I am convinced that it's the only way cheesecake should be made--with ricotta and not cream cheese.  The texture of the ricotta cheesecake was excellent and the cheesecake was a perfect way to end the meal.

Service throughout was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without having to ask.  One of the bus people removed any finished plates.  The staff worked as a team and they worked well together.

A few notes:  If you arrive in the early evening, don't think they're not open.  There are wraps on the windows to shade the sun which the restaurant faces much of the day.  The restaurant itself is a small space, cozy, with interesting decorations including the clothes hanging from the line over the doorway area.  

This was a grand way to start Spring Restaurant Week.  I hope my other choices turn out this well!  A hearty thanks to Chef Madeira and the staff at Bratalian for a very pleasant dinner.",10,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The burger was very juicy, and the sauce on the burger didn't overwhelm the flavor.  The fries were good.

Almost every review mentions how busy this location is and they are all correct.  We waited about 20 minutes to place and receive our order.  The parking lot was almost full near the restaurant although there's another lot north of the main one.  The interior was jammed with people.  A friend waited in line to place our order while I walked around trying to score a table.  It was almost like playing musical chairs and I finally sat at one two seater table before someone else.

The restaurant is along the walkway in the food court area of the Grand Canal Shops.  Given that, the dining is likely to be noisy because there is a lot of foot traffic going by.  That's also fun because you get to watch tourists as they walk by some wondering where the hell they are and where are they going.

I had a reservation for 5 PM and the restaurant was almost empty.  Within fifteen minutes, it was somewhat crowded as people filed in.  I was brought water and iced tea.  Warm bread soon followed the beverages.  I asked the person who took the order if it was possible to get a half order of the frito misto and the answer was no.  It's always a share dish so I passed on that and got the Caesar salad instead.  For the main course, I ordered the fettuccine Casanova.  

When the Caesar salad came, the server ground fresh pepper to my taste.  The salad was a standard, good tasting Caesar with a good amount of cheese and some croutons, one of which was like a rock.

The fettuccine was very good.  Grated cheese was added to my taste.  There are mushrooms, bacon, chicken, cherry tomatoes, and some arugula in the pasta that has a light cream sauce.  I took my time with the pasta enjoying the flavors while watching the people go by.

For dessert, I got an affogato.  The espresso was very rich and the ice cream and coffee went together nicely.

Service was good.  The tables are close together.  I was OK for awhile because to my right was a small aisle for the servers and to my left was a wall.  Later, a family came in, and when they were seated, I could have eaten off the plate of the man right on the other side of the wall.  It was interesting listening to their conversation.  If you come here with someone else and care if people mind what you may say, don't speak in a normal voice.  Keep it low.

Today, I met some friends from the East who I was taking hiking at Mount Charleston and we decided to have breakfast here.  It was a good choice.

We were there when it opened at 7 AM, and we were the first at the omelette/fresh egg station.  I got an omelette made with mushrooms, spinach, jalapeños, and cheese.  The omelette was quickly done by the cook and it was very good.  I also had a few slices of bacon.  It was not crisp nor limp but somewhere in between.  Now it was time for dessert.

I walked over to the crèpe section.  I studied the list of crèpes and decided on the second one, the crèpe made with fresh strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries.  The cook poured the batter, spread it around the griddle with his little crèpe plow, evening out the batter so it was a thin pancake on the griddle.  He turned it and then filled it with the fruit listed above.  After folding it expertly, he topped it with some fresh whipped cream and then spread some raspberry coulis on the whipped cream.  The crèpe was so hot, the whipped cream slid off as I walked back to the table.

I started by doing a walk through of the entire area to see what they had.  I ended up starting with salads.  I had macaroni salad-pretty standard and OK.  The western salad was shredded lettuce with red bell pepper and fresh jalapeño rounds.  This salad had a nice kick and was quite good.  I also had some couscous which also was good.  I did find some bread sticks by the salad station.  In the regular roll area, they had standard large rolls.  They were out of butter packets so only small margarine containers were available.  The breadstick didn't need it.

I then went to the carving area and he had a new piece of beef.  This is not prime rib.  It looked like it was a rectangle of beef and it looked well done.  When I asked the gentleman where had all the nice rare meat gone that had been there when I did my walk through, he cut the beef in half and gave me a nice slice from the less done inside.  I got a piece of bok choy, some hush puppies, and a macadamia crusted chicken breast with apricot.  There was no  macadamia nut flavor at all.  The apricot gave the chicken some taste rather than being plain chicken.

I then went to the desserts.  They had a fairly nice selection of the small plastic cups that are appearing in buffets everywhere.  My first plate had a panna cotta with a lemon top filling with a fresh raspberry, flan with a fresh blackberry and some chopped nuts, and a small container of chocolate trifle.  The panna cotta and the chocolate trifle were great--the flan less so.

Second dessert plate had a macadamia nut cookie, a small pastry filled with vanilla cream and another fresh raspberry, and the star of the desserts, an Oreo cookie cheesecake.

The buffet was OK.  For the $22 they charge, you're not getting the kind of fare you'd get at the Bellagio or other property but they also charge $10 or more.  I wouldn't drive to the Strip to pay for this buffet.  We have a lot better choices in our locals casinos not on the Strip.  But for a comp, it was a nice dinner.  And I really did like the fact that I got more iced tea anytime I wanted without waiting.

Finally, every time I left my table, it was bussed before I got back.  That's not something that happens at all buffets.  I saw several people leaving last night without leaving even a dollar for the bus person.  I know I did most of the work, but he cleaned my table before, during, and after my dinner there last night.  He and the other wait staff deserve a tip!",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Seeing that there were open chairs at the bar, I asked the woman if I could sit there instead and not take up one of their larger tables.  It was OK with her but it was a mistake on my part.

Not all the bartenders take orders it appeared and since there was an hour left in Happy Hour, they were quite busy.  My space was eventually cleared and I was brought a menu.  I also ordered an iced tea.  After deciding to get the fish and chips, I waited for several minutes before my bartender came back to take my order.

About 10 minutes later, a runner appeared behind me with my dinner.  The chips were very good and the slaw with green peas added had a good flavor.  The fish was not impressive at all.  It seemed as if they have perfected the farm raised fish for people who don't like fish--battered fish with no fish taste at all--something my wife would like because she doesn't like fish.  The tartar sauce was OK but there was too little of it.

When it came time for dessert, a different bartender stopped by but he said I had to wait to order and he cleared my area.  He asked if I was done with my drink--I wasn't--but he took the glass, dumped it out, and put it in their mini glass washers that was the most interesting thing of the night for me.  No one asked if I wanted a refill.  I wasn't drinking beer or cocktails so I was merely tasking up a seat at the bar that a drinker could have been.  I should have stayed at the four person booth.

Eventually, my bartender came back and I ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  Again, a 10 minute wait and a runner was behind me with it.  Not stickiness to the toffee and pudding with little flavor.  There are so many good toffee puddings in the area I should have just skipped dessert.

I paid the bill and made a quick exit from this public urban bar.  The place is pricey, the food is very lacking, and the service was awful.  Huge fail.",17,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

For $44 you have your choice of soup or salad, entree and dessert. I had the salad, prime rib, and pecan pie. The salad was your basic salad, but I did enjoy the orange vinaigrette that it came with. I tried some chowder and chili which were both rich and well seasoned. In addition to the prime rib you have your choice of 8 oz filet mignon or seafood gratin. The inner pig in me couldn't resist a full pound of meat so I went with the meatiest, biggest option. I requested the prime rib medium rare and it came out closer to medium but it was still enjoyable and tender. I do think that the best prime rib in town is probably at Durant's but the portions here were amazing. You have your choice of starch or vegetable to go with your meal, I went with the mashed sweet potatoes. They had a light texture and went well with the beef.

Dessert was a sizable slice of pecan pie for me, although there were additional choices of sour cream cheese cake and chocolate cake. The pie was super sweet but the filling was a good consistency and filled with a lot of pecans. The whipped cream on top helped to disperse some of the sugary sweetness of the pie. 

Service was excellent. Our server was friendly and drinks and plates were taken away as needed.

I started with the salad bar and took items sparingly.  I tried the cold, sliced portabello muchrooms, one tomato caprese, asparagus risotto, two small artichoke heart halves, and two large shrimps and a piece of fish from their hot seafood mixture.  This was the extent of my salad bar foray as I didn't want to fill up on salad.  It would be a great dinner in itself.

I turned the coaster to the green side meaning bring on the meat.  Before they started that, a waiter brought three dishes to the table - one with 3 fried plantains, another with mashed potatoes, and a third with green beans with garlic.  These were my vegetables to go with my meat.  A lot of food to accompany a lot of food.

I didn't try all the meats as I was filling up before they had a chance to bring everything to my table.  I liked the small sausage, the first meat I tasted and it was excellent.  Beautiful seasoning.  Then I had two thin slices of rare prime rib which was excellent also.  I had both the chicken breast wrapped in bacon and the tenderloin wrapped in bacon.  Both were very good.  The seasonings were perfect.  I am a salt user extraordinaire, but I salted nothing except the mashed potatoes and green beans.  I had the garlic picanha (top sirloin) and it was superb!!  I also had one slice of beef rib which is sliced from a rack of rib (large--not baby back) and served on a separate small plate. 

Since there were only two tables occupied in the restaurant, there weren't several guys walking around distributing meat like rodizio restaurants.  Two guys were tasked with the serving.  I didn't get the pork loin and I forgot Tony's mentioning of chicken hearts--damn, damn, damn.  Well, something to look forward to next time.

After all this, I did hold back so I could try some dessert.  I had a slice of peanut butter, chocolate chip cheesecake.  Oh yeah--great!

Service was impecable.  My iced tea was refilled often, staff was always around to answer questions or see if you needed something.  I was greeted at the door by a delightful young lady and she also bid me a kind, smiling farewell!

The place is very nicely done.  I love the wine rack that goes almost to the ceiling.  I could see the super ladder inside to extend and reach the highest shelves.

This is a great deal with a Groupon.  The Groupon was $21.  The regular price for the rodizio is $42.95.  I'm not sure I'd be back for the full price, but the Groupon certainly makes it a great deal.  Come on Groupon--let's get anohter Via Brasil.  And you know, I'll probably go back and pay the full price if one of my friends from out of town who loves rodizio comes to Las Vegas.  We'll go together!",8,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Note, they don't open until 8 and I was a little early and had to wait the five minutes to opening.

The interior is no longer a wide open space but has been changed into smaller areas that make dining more pleasurable and also cuts down on noise.

After being seated, I was promptly greeted by my server who brought water and then coffee I ordered.  I ordered the stuffed French toast which the menu describes as:  Two think slices of raspberry chocolate bread, soaked in a rich vanilla cinnamon custard, stuffed with sweet mascarpone cheese filling and served with warm maple syrup.

This was a large breakfast.  The mascarpone is flavored with raspberry also because it was a pink color.  There was some raspberry syrup drizzled over the slices and some powdered sugar.  The French toast was OK but it was a bit moist bordering on being soggy.  I did not use the syrup as I generally don't use maple syrup--real or phony.  The photo on the menu shows the toast decorated with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprig of mint.  Instead, there was a cup of butter and a sprig of parsley.

We came here on a Monday early evening, and we were the only customers in the restaurant. One other couple trickled in during our service though. The interior is cute, with a refreshing green palette that mimics the vibrant colors of Vietnamese food itself. 

We pored through the menu, and I honed in on the vegetarian items. I'm not a vegetarian, but I do try to limit my meat intake and are always on the lookout for good vegetarian dishes. They have a decent selection, and I decided on the vegetarian fish with vegetables and ginger. 

First though, we started out with the egg roll appetizer. It was crisp, flavorful, and delicious. It had the right mix of spices, and the dipping sauce went well with it. 

The entrees came shortly after. The faux fish was very good. It even had a dark bean curd ""skin"" that tasted a lot like the crisp skin of a nicely cooked fish. The texture was very similar to a white-fleshed fish, and was tender.

The sauce was similar to a sweet and sour sauce, laced with the kind of pea and carrot mixture you would find in the freezer section of a grocery store, ginger, cilantro, celery, tomato, and tofu. While I enjoyed the fish, after eating half of it, I got tired of the sweet/sour taste of the sauce and had the rest of it boxed up to go. The presentation was very nice though, and it came with a pickled daikon/carrot mixture, an orange slice, nicely sliced cucumber, and tomato slices.

My husband ordered the pho ga (Chicken pho), which had large pieces of chicken breast in it, with fresh vegetables and a lot of noodles to go with the broth and meat. I tasted some of the broth- it was decent, albeit a little watery tasting.

Overall, a decent place for Vietnamese cuisine, and probably the closest Vietnamese place to where we live!",4,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We started with the asparagus and octopus appetizer. the octopus was very tender and beautifully presented. The asparagus was perfectly cooked with a great combination of textures and flavors.

We all each ordered a different protein dish and shared a bit of them with each other. Each person's entree was superb, well prepared, and flavorful. Out of all the dishes my favorite was probably the flat iron steak. It was perfectly medium rare, tender, and well seasoned. 

My actual entree was a fish course which I unfortunately can't remember the name to (Started with an O), and was a white-fleshed fish. It was cooked perfectly with a crispy skin contrasting with soft, tender meat. It was beautifully presented and the sauce, prosciutto, and vegetables went well with the fish. It was a good portion of food (2 fillets). The only negative (And a big negative for me) was that I had a large, long bone in one of my fillets. If I am paying close to $30 for my entree of filleted fish you better get all the bones out! 

Dessert was exquisite, and they even have affogato ($7) which was a heavenly mixture of hazelnut gelato with espresso.

Despite showing signs of its age, we had a good time here, for a reasonable price, especially for North Scottsdale.

We started with the go-carts. They offer two-seaters and individual carts. The two-seaters are meant more for kids and their parents, since the passenger seat is very tiny. The track was pretty fun to race around, although our cart had some engine issues (It would sputter, then decide to work again and we'd get a burst of speed, then slow down and sputter again...). Getting bumped by another car can easily put your car out of commission since there is no way to drive in reverse on the car if you get turned around. The attendants are always very watchful though and will help you out in a bind.

We also played a round of mini-golf. There are 2-3 different courses to choose from. We chose the ""Optical Delusion"" course, which consisted of 18 short holes with various slopes and tricky corners built into them. Compared to say, Golfland, the courses were old, showing signs of age with scuffed greens. They are also pretty basic. While at Golfland you can putt through moving obstacles, so that timing is key, the holes at CrackerJax are very basic, just green, slopes, and the hole (And maybe an occasional decoration). After the first few holes, the courses seemed to get monotonous, since there is very little background variation between the different holes.

The mini golf course can get especially long if you are playing with a large group. It felt like forever going through 18 holes of mini golf with 6 people!

Other attractions that we did not try include a bungy dome, bumper boats, driving range, a water balloon game, batting cages, volleyball courts, and a limited selection of arcade games. 

We did try out a few arcade games, and got around 60 tickets after spending a few dollars on a ""Whack an alligator"" (The reptilian version of Whack a Mole) game and this weird bee-catching game. The prize selection here is pretty dismal though, and we walked out with 3 army men at 20 tickets each.

Sometime in between the noodles and the pancake, I asked about the iced tea which had not yet been delivered.  She went to the drink bar area and retrieved an iced tea for me.

When I ordered the noodles, the server checked to make sure I knew they were spicy.  Yes, I knew, but they weren't.  On the tables are condiments common to noodle and rice shops.  Take the red jar of spicy chili pepper and oil and spoon heaping amounts on the noodles if you want your noodles spicy.

I think this is a great location for acai bowls, since Sprouts is just a few steps away, bringing in the more health-conscious crowd.  I went in with high hopes of getting a healthy, fruitful bowl.

There are quite a few bowls to choose from, some of them fruity, others more dessert-like, with peanut butter and chocolate.  I opted for a fruitier bowl, getting the tropical.  This was my first time trying an acai bowl, and it was quite tasty.  The bottom layer was a smooth, thick acai puree/sorbet-like mixture, which tasted berry-like.  There was crunchy, sweet granola layered in between the acai and the tropical fruit (Banana, mango, and pineapple), with large, thin shaved pieces of coconut completing the bowl. The granola itself was a high quality mixture, containing ingredients such as flax seed. The bowl was a nice mixture of textures and of tastes.  I ordered a small (About $5), and it definitely filled me up!

While it was a fun time, it's not something that would be on my radar as a yearly event.

I had a better time, as I have in the past, of just walking around the mall and looking at the menus of the various Asian restaurants and checking their ratings on Yelp do decide on future places to try when I'm in the area.  Since I often go to Las Vegas Little Theatre which is in Chinatown, I can do two things in the evening and enjoy some good food before dinner.
I did make a purchase.  I stopped in the Diamond Bakery, a place I've been to several times before.  

I do like the Las Vegas Chinatown Plaza.  Although small with many good places spread out to the west along Spring Mountain Road, this is still a fun place to walk around and soak up the sights.",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The sandwiches hover below the $4 range, with an option to make it a combo meal which includes a drink for a 10% discount. I went with the #1 Mekong special. It included pork belly, ham, steamed pork, head cheese, and pate. It was absolutely delicious. The bread was freshly baked and had a light crisp crunch with a perfectly soft inner surface. The meats were flavorful and more plentiful than in a Lee's sandwich. I also tried the #3 grilled beef sandwich which had a flavorful marinade and was full of beef and vegetables.

Service was fast and friendly at the counter. There is a case of various Vietnamese goodies such as pate chaud and bamboo leaf wrapped sticky rice.

I also had an iced green milk tea which was overall refreshing but had a bit of a floral aftertaste which was weird to me.

I go to the Riviera to see shows - generally the Riviera Comedy Club where I went last night.  The casino is certainly showing its age.  I don't think there's been much of a renovation there in years, at least none that I've noticed.

The layout is OK and cocktail service has been prompt.  She stopped by 3 times last night in a very brief time even though the casino was the busiest I've seen it in months (there was an archery competition and convention at their convention center).

This is an OK place, but if I were staying or playing more seriously, it would be someplace else.",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We came here for their all you can eat Sunday buffet. It was a spectacular array of food, a mix of southwestern and southern comfort dishes. Some items at the buffet included carved rotisserie turkey, pork loin, green chile pork, fried green tomatoes, roasted beets, green bean casserole, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon and pork belly hash. There was also a wide selection of pastries and cookies for dessert.

My favorite dishes from the buffet were the green chile pork and the smoked salmon. The pork was very tender and the flavors were bold and spicy. The flour tortillas they were paired with were warm and very fresh. The salmon was very moist and soft with just the right amount of smoke flavor.

The price for the buffet was $18.95, not bad at all for the amount of food we had to choose from! We came here around 11 and it wasn't too busy either.

If I'm in a gluttonous mood I'll definitely be coming back to this buffet!",67,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

For starters, I ordered the seafood miso soup.  The menu says clams, shrimp, and bay scallops.  There was one clam which was very good.  The shrimp was fine and the bay scallops were good, too.

For the main course, I got the sesame encrusted lobster tail.  The plating was artfully done.  The lobster was OK.  I had two issues.  One, encrusted means one thing to me and another to Koi.  I imagined more sesame but there was merely a sprinkling.  Second, the lobster tail didn't have a very distinctive lobster flavor.  It was rather bland.  The kitchen helps you out by cutting under the meat and along the sides and then across the meat.  You're able to eat it easily without having the whole tail removed from its shell.  With the lobster, you get baby bok choy.

For dessert, I chose the flourless molten chocolate cake.  It comes with some berries and vanilla ice cream with butterscotch sauce.  This was excellent!

Service was very good.  My iced tea glass was replaced with a fresh one as I neared the end of each one--no need to ask for a refill.  

This place just lacked the 4 star experience I'd hoped for.  It was the food, not the service that brings me to rate it as OK.  I still have money on the gift card, so I'll be back to try something else in the future.",5,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Disappointments were the teriyaki chicken (too sweet) and the artisan breads.  The breads have never been outstanding, but they seem to be closer to regular sliced bread than artisan.

Desserts as always were good.  I think the cannoli are the best of any buffet in town.  I wasn't fond of the pecan pie, but the creme brulee is outstanding.  

Service was top notch.  The server brought fresh glasses of iced tea before I was finished with one, and he brought coffee with dessert.  50% off for people 50 and older on Wednesday makes this a super value.",5,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The seating was arranged in almost a semi-circle fashion in front of its proscenium stage.  Last night, the seating was arranged into four sections.

The things I liked were the chairs were padded and weren't simply folding metal chairs which become tiresome during a concert.  Also, they were not attached to each other with self-locking plastic ties--again something than some venues do.  The negatives of the seating were that the chairs were close together and while there was plenty of legroom under the chair in front, you couldn't cross your legs without whacking the person sitting next to you.

For the concert last night, the sound was excellent.  The sound people were on their toes and kept things at the correct level all night.  I also noticed the number of lights in the club and watched as they were used very effectively for the concert.

This is an OK venue for a concert.",1,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Since we were served at the Yelp event, I didn't know the routine of entering the right doors, placing your order, getting your buzzer, and then waiting for the food to be ready.  A gentleman leaving told me to go in the other door and order there.

After looking at the menu for a short time, I got two SmokeShack burgers--cheeseburgers with bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and ShackSauce. I ordered two fries with cheese.   I also ordered two regular iced teas.  I then took the buzzer, took my seat, and waited for for the buzzer to go off.  There was no drink until you picked up the order which is a minus for me.  I could have gotten some ice water but why no drink while you sit there?

In a reasonable amount of time, the buzzer went off and I collected dinner for the two of us from the pick up area.  The burgers were OK.  The bacon was good as was the tang from the cherry peppers but I got no flavor from the ShackSauce at all.  It was a colossal mistake to get the cheese fries.  That was partially my fault.  I should never order fries with any topping.  The cheese on these fries was overwhelming and it made the somewhat soggy fries even more so.  Naked fries as the best fries in my book.  Before we were finished, the fries were a soggy heap that would have made good food fight material.

We decided we'd try a concrete for dessert.  My wife wanted the Red Velvet and I got the S'mores.  After ordering, the counter critter told me their regular blender wasn't working and that the concrete would have the normal mix ins on top.  Really, one of your claims to fame is your concrete and you have one blender.  That's like saying our regular grill is broken.  Is a frozen patty OK?  They weren't concretes and even if the accoutrements had been mixed in, I don't see how this frozen custard could ever be called ""concrete.""

In summation, it was worth a try.  There are so many better options where you can get your own drinks and refills.  And, you don't have to go through the ordering line all over again.",17,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

In the nine years I have been going to this center, there has been a large turnover.  I think people get trained, get some experience, and then move on to better paying jobs.

Still, the act of donating blood or its components is one of the most satisfying things you can do.  It takes an investment of time but the rewards are great.

We had an order of spring rolls with tamarind sauce that was excellent.  My wife had the Spicy Basil with ground chicken and I had the Pad Prik King with chicken.  Her spiciness was 0 and mine was 6.  Both dishes were very tasty.

A note on their spiciness--I think their 6 is more a 7 or 8 at other Thai restaurants so choose the number with care.  I didn't need any more spice even though I usually order a level of 8 at other places.

I had the Thai coffee which I liked a lot.  The only thing that detracted from dinner was that the dishes were a bit heavy with salt.  That's unusual for me to say, because I am a serial salter.

Service was excellent!  The waitress was very helpful, cheerful, and she was a pleasure to talk with.  She gave us coupons for a return visit just in case we didn't get another Restaurant.com certificate.

In addition to your standard burritos, chimichangas, and tacos, they also offer options like sopes and have a small American style menu for those not wishing to eat Mexican food at a Mexican restaurant :). 

We were seated immediately at a bright, comfortable booth. The decor is very festive and lively, with warm gold and yellow tones echoing throughout the restaurant. I loved the atmosphere, the unique tables, and the vivid, multi-colored cloth napkins. As soon as we were seated we received some chips and salsa. Both were quite good. The salsa was green and was filled with fire roasted green chiles, adding a nice spicy kick to go with the light, crisp chips. We looked through the menu and I decided on a 2 item combination plate ($8.95) with chile relleno and chicken enchilada, and. I also tried some carnitas chimichanga. 

The chile relleno is a lighter version of what I usually see in restaurants. The poblano chile is not breaded and fried, but still stuffed with cheese. I enjoyed it, as the chile was perfectly cooked with good flavor. The chicken enchilada was filled with shredded white meat chicken. Again, it tasted like a lighter version of what I usually see in most restaurants. The rice was green, which was a unique twist, and had a more delicate flavor. The refried beans were decent, no complaints. The carnitas chimichanga was filled with tender carnitas pork, and I could taste a hint of cumin in the mix. Like the other components of my meal, this dish also had more of a delicate flavor.

Service was friendly and cheerful and we were checked on as needed.

I have been to the theatre for five shows and I find it to be a fairly good venue.  Access off the Boulevard or Washington is easy and for this event, there was no fee for parking.

The theatre seats just under 1,900 so it's a good sized space.  The stage is quite large able to handle large productions such as Les Misérables which was one of the shows I saw here.

I recently went to see the musical ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" performed as a partnership between the Nevada State Thespians and the Clark County School District.  The theatre and the Center proved to be quite capable of hosting the large production with a cast in the 30s or more and with plenty of room for scenery.

My only complaint would be that they need more bathroom space when the theatre has a good house.  There just isn't enough with one ladies and one men's room.

Once we procured a table, we browsed through the extensive menu and ordered enough food for a small army (What can I say, my eyes were bigger than my stomach!). We had the super Spiderman roll, bulgolgi bimbimbap, seafood pancake, jap chae, and spicy pork. Our starting banchan was a threesome of kimchi, sprouts, and fish cake. 

The roll was huge, and filled with soft shell crab, shrimp, and veggies. The jap chae was excellent, filled with a lot of veggies and very tender, marinated beef. The noodles were cooked perfectly. The bimbimbap was a huge portion, beautifully arranged. I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't more caramelization of the rice on the bottom of the stone bowl. I love the crispy rice bits mixed in with the rest of the rice, veggies, and meat in this dish. The spicy pork was also very tender and flavorful, but not exceedingly spicy. The seafood pancake was good, but could have used a bit more cooking to crisp up the outside for more texture balance.

Service was a bit uneven as it took a long time to actually order, but once our order was placed we were checked on frequently and with very friendly staff.

I had a reservation for 5 PM which would give me plenty of time for the 7 PM show.  As the hostess was walking with me, she asked if I wanted bar seating for happy hour or did I want dinner seating in the downstairs dining room.  Bingo!  Downstairs to avoid any loudness!  I never knew it existed.

Down about 7 steps is a large room off the pool at TI and this is there main dining room.  I was seated halfway in the dining room and I had a good view toward both one pool area and the stairs.  Right in front of me was a TV with Monday Night football so that took my attention.  

Rowan was my server and he was there soon with menu and took my order for iced tea.  After looking things over and asking about the soup of the day, I opted for chicken tortilla soup to start and Bang Bang shrimp for the main course.

The chicken tortilla soup is listed on the menu as spicy but it wasn't--at least not for me.  The soup was very hot and it was good.  The chicken was a bit meager.  There were some tortilla chips standing in the bowl instead of the normal tortilla strips most places use.  This was good.  At this time came the only glitch in service.  Before I finished my soup, a runner came from the kitchen with my main course.  Damn, I wish restaurants would watch this.  If I hadn't been somewhat close to finishing my soup, I would have sent her back.  But then, it would probably sit under a heat lamp for a few minutes.

The Bang Bang shrimp was very good and a reason to return.  The dish consists of 8 shrimp with bacon, zucchini, yellow squash, broccoli, red pepper, and carrots.  The shrimp have a nice spicy zest to them making their bang bang name appropriate.  The rice appeared to be regular rice rather than jasmine and the shrimp wasn't served over a bed of rice as the menu states, but it was a good looking dish with an orchid in the rice.  Nice touch.

For dessert, I got the pineapple upside down cake with vanilla ice cream.  It was OK and something different.

Service was very good.  Rowan brought a new iced tea before I finished the first one and he asked if I wanted a cup to take my leftover iced tea with me.  His service was very good and he was a very personable and polite man.

On the way out, the hostess wished me a good evening and used my name which was a very nice touch.  This is a place to which I'd return if I were coming to TI, not something I do very often.",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The cone was made was made from bagel dough and was filled with cream cheese and topped with salmon row.  The olives were both good but the stuffed one was the best.

Next up were 6 croquetas de jamón, small fried balls stuffed with béchamel with Iberico ham.  These were excellent.  There was a lot of béchamel flavoring but the ham flavor was not quite there.

The next item was an Italian grissini--a long breadstick--that was wrapped with very thinly sliced beef and served with a caramelized onion purée.  Really good.

Then the chateaubriand was brought.  The hot plate was put on a raised wooden platform and the server put two of the slices on my plate and spooned perigord sauce over the pieces.  There was also a folded napkin filled with pomme soufflé.  These were puffed potatoes like 4D potato chips.  The steak was seasoned perfectly with just the right amount of salt and pepper. Along with all of this was a serving of Robuchon potatoes which the menu describes as ""butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes.  It was creamy and delightful!!  Still one more accompaniment to the main course was some grilled asparagus on Romesco sauce.

After this, I was brought three small desserts--a lemon meringue tart, a chocolate cream puff, and a chocolate bon bon.  

Almost everything was very good but I'd subtract some for the deserts.  There's nothing creative there.  These type of small tarts and cream puffs are what you'd find on a higher end buffet line and was so out of character with the rest of the meal.

Service was excellent.  Edward refilled my iced tea often and was always around for anything I might need.

One thing of note, as I was watching the one cook making steak tartare, he would put a small tasting fork into the mixture and check the flavor and then tossed the fork.  I told him if he wanted a third party, neutral taster, I'd volunteer.  Just after my dessert was brought, he handed over the counter a steak tartar slider with a raw quail egg.  A really nice gesture and a perfect ending to a fun and flavorful meal.

This gave me a chance to try some of Bazaar's food in smaller portions.  I recommend trying the summer tasting menu.",25,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

It was sickeningly sweet (tasted sweeter than my soda!), and there were raisins in the tomato sauce which probably added to the sweetness.  The ground meat on the inside on the other hand, was very bland.  I thought when you had something as a ""special"", such as the Friday stuffed cabbage, that meant it was supposed to be really good?  The overwhelming sweetness of the sauce made it very hard to eat.

The only redeeming factor in the meal was when I tried some of the Straw sandwich (pastrami, sauerkraut, swiss), which was decent, nothing spectacular, but a whole lot better than the stuffed cabbage.  At other delis I've been to, you can get a whole lot more meat, and more flavor for about the same price, so I will probably be skipping any future visits to this deli.",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We were guests of Chef Brian Massie, Executive chef for the Light group Las Vegas.  Executive Chef Renieri Caceres of Fix had picked some dishes he wanted us to try and we added some others from the menu.

The items we had consisted of five appetizers, two mains, and three desserts.  The dishes were:

Appetizers:

Lobster tacos with grilled mango and cilantro
Prosciutto wrapped dates with chorizo, roasted piquillo & San Marzano sauce
Duck prosciutto flatbread with Fromage Blanc, onions, Pecorino cheese, and Rocket Greens (from the menu)
Wood grilled bruschetta with Greek yogurt, citrus, and blackberry jam
Ultimate very adult mac and cheese with truffle oil and prosciutto

The two main dishes were:

Duck and waffles, confit with a fried egg and maple bourbon syrup
100 day dry aged bone in rib eye with lobster mashed potatoes and sweet corn spoon bread

The desserts were:

Chocolate s'mores with flourless cake, graham crunch, burnt fluff, and milk chocolate pudding
Warm banana bread with coconut ice cream and Malibu Anglaise
Warm apple pie filled doughnuts with rum raisin and cinnamon apple dipping sauces.

In addition, we had iced tea and I had a plain coffee after dessert.

We were greeted at the podium at 8 and shown to our table by a pleasant hostess and were soon taken care of by a great team of servers who were excellent.  Iced tea glasses were replaced before finishing the one we were drinking, water glasses were kept filled, and the table was cleaned between each course with politeness and great finesse.

The dishes were all very good.  The only dish I thought wasn't very successful were the lobster tacos.  The bruschetta was excellent.  I asked about the round yogurt balls in EVOO and the server explained the technique for making them.  Spread on the grilled bread and topped with some blackberry jam, marvelous!  Not to be outdone, the prosciutto wrapped dates with chorizo were large and very tasty.

In the main, the duck was wonderfully done with a crispy skin and the waffles were quite good.  The amazing thing was the 100 day dry aged ribeye, something that we were told was a special.  It was tomahawk style, sliced from the accompanying bone as providing approximately a dozen medium rare slices of delicious beef with a flavor I haven't enjoyed before not having had beed aged that amount of time.

The desserts were amazing, too!  My favorite was the warm banana bread pudding with coconut ice cream and Malibu Anglaise.  The doughnuts were very good as was the s'mores.  Any one of the three would be worthy choices.

Two and a half hours later, we left, quite full and with a big smile from the delightful meal we had just finished.  Many thanks to the two chefs and a top notch crew for making dinner such a memorable event.",10,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
3UaveCUOMVldbds1QMS9sg,8,2017-05-08,5,7cGYfczFS2cXmopYmWUq2w,3,"This is an approximately one hour show that mixes magic with some music.  It's on the second floor of the Hooters Hotel & Casino.  It is NOT in the Night Owl Showroom on the main casino floor.

The venue is small and intimate.  Where to sit for best viewing depends on what you do.  If you opt for the upgrade to a Hooter's dinner between 6 and 7, you will be seated at one of the three VIP tables that are in the front of the low stage.  Then comes four or five rows of regular chairs, and finally there are some high top tables behind those.  If you do not get the meal, I recommend you take one of the hightop tables.  I was in the second row, aisle, of normal chairs behind the VIP tables and there was one section of the show (the levitation) where I could not see what was happening because of the low level of the stage, the piano put more to the rear of the stage, and the heads in front of me at the VIP seats.  Some of the time my seat was OK but many times it was not.

As for the show, the two men are genial, sometimes funny, but not belly laugh funny, and they do some standard magic tricks.  I guess since I've lived in Las Vegas for so many years and have seen so many magic shows, there's nothing new except a different twist on an old trick.  I did like the Beethoven switch part.  The show ended with Metamorphosis, which though not invented by Houdini, was made famous by him when Houdini did the trick with his wife.  Once you know the secret of the trick, it's a matter of practice to get as fast as you can.  The two men have obviously been practicing a lot because they pulled off Metamorphosis in a quick manner.

There is some interplay between Jarrett and Raja over playing the piano (Raja) versus magic (Jarrett).  There were a couple of times I wish I was able to listen to Raja more but it's like a comedy routine where the one keeps interrupting when the other one wants to do their thing.

An A-OK show but not a show I'd see again.",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I had heard of Social Bistro and Wine Bar shortly after it opened and the Restaurant Week menu appealed to me.  I was seated and given the menus.  When my server, Ray, appeared to take a drink order, I asked him for the Restaurant Week menu.  The iced tea I ordered was brogfuth promptly and I placed my order.

To start, I got the lobster mac and cheese.  It was not the traditional elbow macaroni but rather spiral pasta.  There was a fair amount of lobster in a creamy parmesan reggiano sauce and topped with extra grated cheese and some crumbs.  The pasta was steaming hot and the flavors were very good.

For the main course, I had to try the risotto with chicken.  The risotto was cooked perfectly.  There was a good amount of chicken in the dish and the portion was quite large, such that I almost asked for some to take home.  Almost is the key word.  I ended up eating the whole lot.

For dessert, I got the blueberry bread pudding with whipped cream.  This is a flavor of bread budding rarely seen so I had to try it.  I liked it very much.

Service was excellent.  There was spacing between courses giving me time to check my phone for messages, etc., and allowing me to enjoy dinner at a relaxed pace but not at a pace that would have had me tapping my foot wondering where my food was.  Ray refilled my iced tea without needing to ask and he was around to see how things were.

This was the first bright moment of Restaurant Week for me and I'm glad I put this on my to try list.",10,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The Stratosphere casino is a fairly large area that meanders from the self park garage around to Las Vegas Boulevard.  There are little tricks to remember where you want to go and which set of stairs/escalators are the best for getting to the theatre.

The casino itself has a good selection of various slots and denominations.  They seem to target the lower rollers like me.  The casino seems to be a lot cleaner than it was when I've been there in the past.  The cocktail waitresses were around often last night and were very pleasant women.  I did notice the large percent of people who were smoking but unless you were right near them, smoke was not a problem.  They've installed a good ventilation system.

I'll always have fond thoughts about the Strat even though I'm not there very often.  It was here when I was invited to a free slot tournament that through some twist of fate, I came in first and won the grand prize of $10,000.  That still doesn't buy the place an extra star but it brings warm fuzzy thoughts!",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The tart was very good and just what I'd expect from Bouchon.  The only problem with this small outlet near the sports book and clock tower is there is no place to sit.  It is almost entirely takeout.

The tart was boxed which wasn't necessary.  I ended up removing the tart from the box and using one of their plastic forks to start eating the tart.  I soon gave up and picked it up and ate it like that.

There's a water dispenser at the bar with the plasticware and sugars/creams for coffee, but it wasn't working.  After finishing, I went to the nearest bathroom in the casino to wash my hands.

It was a little after noon but there was little wait.  My order was taken and I had a seat in the shade of the front of the stand while waiting.  During that time, it was interesting to see tourists and locals walk by on the Boulevard.  Quite a cross section of humanity going by.

The sandwich came and it was packed nicely in a bag.  It was wrapped in paper and sealed with one of their logo stickers.  The sandwich, the foie, was very good.  It was filled with ingredients.  There's no scrimping here.  The crispy chicken skin and the almond were a nice touch for texture.  I had the sandwich Monte Cristo style and it was nicely grilled.  I also had a diet soda to go with the sandwich.

This is a good place to stop but I'm not a fan of sitting nearly on the sidewalk or in my car.  Hopefully, the guys will be able to get a real shop (if that's their goal).  In that case, I would be more likely to make follow up visits.  This isn't close to my house nor am I in this area that often unless planned.

They offer sandwiches, pizza, soups, and salads with the option to do half and half. I had a half portion of wintergreen salad and a half portion of eggplant goat sandwich. I was handed a buzzer and off I went in search of a seat. 

While there is nice seating indoors, the shaded outdoor patio is quite nice so I took a seat there. When the buzzer signaled that my food was ready I went back inside to grab it, then headed back to the patio. The salad and sandwich were a good portion of food, just enough for lunch. The salad was filled with fresh greens, thinly sliced apple, goat cheese, sweet potato, dates, walnuts, and vinagrette. I enjoyed the combination of flavors and textures and the dressing was lightly sweet. 

The sandwich had roasted eggplant pieces, goat cheese, onion, red bell pepper, harissa tahini, and arugula. All the ingredients were good together and I liked that they used multigrain bread. The bread was too oily for me though.

Service was very friendly and I was checked up on to make sure everything was OK.

Their voices are similar to the Bee Gees I grew up with and to which I listened a lot.  From the late 60s with ""Massachusetts"" to the more modern disco sounds of Grease and Saturday Night Fever, they covered a litany of the Bee Gees music.

1/3 of the way into the show, the drummer and bass player left the stage and the 3 used just one mike and one guitar for several songs they sang.  It was a superb series of songs and really showed off their talents.

At the end, when they were doing the disco music, Club ""Mo"" opened and people were invited to come up and dance and one number they sang was ""You Should Be Dancing.""  

As for the venue, it's relatively small, holding a couple of hundred people.  I got a seat along the counter between the floor seating and the rear seats.  It was a great place to sit because I had a place to lean on, place my soda, and just be comfortable a bit higher up than the floor and with an unobstructed view of the stage.  I've been in the theatre before to see Louie Anderson and Ronn Lucas, and I was seated at one of the 8 person long tables, and I don't like that layout as well.

A few gripes about shows in general, namely audiences.  Please plan to arrive ON TIME.  Coming in 20 minutes late is not fashionable and is very disruptive to other members of the audience.  Also, the fact that you paid to see the show doesn't mean you have the right to keep talking throughout the show.  Why do people pay good money to see a show and then miss a lot of it because their talking with the person with whom they came.  Shut up, watch, and listen.

This is one of those places that I never think of going to because it's a bit of a pain for a local.  Park in the garage, walk in through the Star Lane Shops, go through the casino to the Studio Walk shops and there you'll find Emeril's New Orleans Fish House.  Well, I found out it's worth the pain.  I had a show at the Venetian at 8 PM, so I made a reservation with Open Table for 5:30 and I was seated immediately.

Then began service that was equal to some of the finest restaurants at which I've eaten in this  town.  One of three people was always aware, in an unobtrusive way, where I was with any of the courses.  Within seconds of finishing a course, someone was there to ask if they could remove the dish.  When my iced tea was almost finished, a new glass was brought and replaced the old one without having to ask.  And, Emeril's passed my pink packet test with an A+ grade!  I began this review with the service first because I wanted it to be the stand out it was.

For the first course, I chose the Caesar salad with romaine hearts, parmesan cheese, roasted garlic grissini and a creamy house dressing.  Most of the description comes from the menu.  The dressing and shredded parmesan were outstanding.

For course two, I had to go with the gumbo.  After all, Emeril's New Orleans Fish House, isn't it a law you have to try the gumbo.  It was a mixture of shrimp, chicken and Andouille pork suasage with okra and rice.  The gumbo had the proper thickness and it was peppery spicy, not hot sauce spicy.  it was very good.

For the main course, I went with the sweet barbecued Atlantic salmon.  My waiter said the chef suggested medium rare cooking.  I told him it could be closer to rare and that's just the way it was.  As the menu states, accompanying the salmon were ""spicy Andouille pork sausage hash, crystal fried onion crust And Emeril's house made Worcestershire.""  There were pieces of Andouille, cubed potatoes, and some fresh tomatoes.  The salmon was excellent and the barbecue cooking gave me the chance to try salmon prepared in a different manner.

To end this dinner, I chose an item not on their online RW Week menu but is on their normal menu.  It's the flourless bourbon chocolate cake with sweet cherry compote and peanut butter mousse.  What a combination!  Delicious chocolate cake with some peanut butter mousse and some cherries.  One forkful was a blast of different flavors.  This is a winner.  There were also some chopped, glazed nuts for texture.

This was an excellent beginning to my Restaurant Week. 

Note to M Life members.  If you take your receipt to the M Life club, they'll give you M Life points for the value of your dinner but you can't get it directly from Emeril's.",4,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The toppings themselves are high quality, and they have quite a few to choose from. Some that I can remember off the top of my head include thinly sliced steak, grilled chicken, artichoke hearts, black olive, capicola, pepperoni, fresh and shredded mozzarella, Parmesan cheese, anchovies, spinach.... you get the point. The possibilities are endless. Sauces are equally as diverse including your basic tomato, pesto, olive oil and garlic, just to name a few! 

Due to the endless possibilities for your pizza, a lot of the long lines at the restaurant are due to the time it takes to name off each topping you want for your pizza. I love how the menu online has a bubble selection so you can check off your toppings and sauce as you want. Perhaps it would speed up the process more if each customer were able to check off what they wanted on a printed sheet and hand it off to a staff member?

The pizza itself only took a few minutes to make and in the meantime we were able to find seats easily and get drinks. The fountain beverages are Coke-based, and there is a nice variety of China Mist teas available as well. The watermelon iced tea is one of my favorites!

My pizza had a mix of meats (Chicken and steak) and veggies (Spinach, black olives, sauteed onion, peppers, and mushroom). It tasted great except for one bite which had an overwhelming amount of salt on it. It really did taste like someone had poured a whole spoonful of salt onto this piece. I had to spit it out. The rest of the pizza luckily had a normal amount of salt on it.

We ordered three dishes to share:  The Singapore rice noodles were excellent.  There was a fair number of shrimp and some small slices of pork along with onions.  The curry flavor was good.  For my taste, I could have used a bit more.  We got an order of wrinkled green beans.  I don't think they were seared as much as they should have been to make them wrinkled.  They were crisp.  Their flavor was very good.  Finally, we got the half roasted Cantonese duck.  The flavor of the duck was a winner, too!  I'm not a big fan of duck when it's on the bone, but this was cooked well.  

Service was good.  My iced tea refilled often without asking.  We did have to ask a server to bring us some clean plates so we could get rid of some of the duck bones.  

The one drawback of Ping Pang Pong was the loudness of the place for the first 1/3 of the hour and a half we were there.  It was so noisy from people talking loudly and the kitchen staff, filling orders for take out and yelling the orders to each other.

I think they've done that very well.  The one part that I thought was hysterical was not received well by early audiences.  I guess you had to have a sick sense of humor.

The show is patterned after any other improv show you've seen especially the successful TV show ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?""  An MC asks the audience to call out situations which the cast then uses in their improvisations.  The twist being they improvise using puppets rather than speaking directly to the audience.  Sometimes, this make the improv funny but I found it to become tedious after awhile.

Couple that with some Las Vegas show goers coming to the theatre having had enough alcohol to loosed them up and you have the recipe for some raunchy ideas shouted out.  I wasn't offended by anything more than I felt pity for the people who thought they were being funny.

The cast is talented but nothing that I haven't seen before except the puppets.  In a way they detracted because the actors had to hold the puppets high enough for the camera to pick them up for projecting and the actors had to stare at monitors on the stage to make sure they had the puppets held in the correct positions.

Before looking at the menu, one of the bus people came and brought me coffee. I first checked the specials board.  Then I looked over the menu.  After some thought, I went with one of the specials and ordered a Cordon bleu skillet.  The skillet had potatoes, chicken, ham, and swiss cheese and Hollandaise.  I got my two eggs over easy and rye toast.

In less than five minutes, my server brought the skillet over and it looked great!  It also tasted that way.  The chicken pieces were real chicken--not formed chicken.  The swiss cheese covered the top.  I was pleasantly surprised that the skillet was not heavy on cubed potatoes to use a cheaper ingredient to cut back on the ham and chicken.

My coffee was refilled without waiting and service was good.  I'm glad we now have a good breakfast place in the neighborhood.",6,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

After a filling dinner, we decided we did have some space in our stomachs to indulge in some refreshing dessert. The restaurant has a cheery interior with lots of bright color and equally bright colored desserts available. The menu has desserts, snacks, and tortas/sandwiches to satisfy anyone wanting something sweet, light, or savory. 

We tried a sample of the raspados de leche quemada which had a delicious caramelized, rich flavored milk added to the ice. We did decide on a different dessert but next time I feel like getting shaved ice I will try this version of raspados. I had the fresas con crema and tried the pico de gallo. The fresas was a huge portion of thick syrupy cream, freshly sliced strawberries, and granola. It was sweet, rich, creamy, and a great balance of textures and flavors. The pico de gallo was also good as well, with fresh mango, jicama, cucumber, and watermelon spears dusted with chili-lime powder. 

At another visit I also tried the basic raspadas (Con fresas) and it was decent, but a bit too simple for me. It had syrup, a few strawberries, and shaved ice. The mangoneada I had was too much of a salty flavor for me with a few chunks of mango, mostly shaved ice, and chili lime salt with syrup.

I ended up here because it was bookmarked and because the other place I was going to try didn't open until 7 either and I wasn't going to wait there that long.  See it was an early flight.

When the doors were unlocked, I went in and had my choice of where to sit.  It's not a large place.  The server brought my menu and after some thought, I got the Huevos Divorciados, divorced eggs.  It comes with potatoes, refried beans, and tortillas.  The divorced of the eggs is one red and one green.  The green is topped by some good chile verde and the red is gotten from a red sauce that has a bit of a kick.

On the wall on the west side of the room is an area where they have the plastic ware you dispense for yourself and there are napkins there, too.

The breakfast was good but the plate was detracted by how poorly it looked on arrival.  The potato slices run on to the eggs which run onto the beans.  It tasted better than it looked.  Perhaps less runny beans or a plate with compartments?

Service was OK after a little bit of a shaky start.  I had to wait for the coffee but that was OK.  They just opened and they were brewing a fresh pot.

I was the only customer when I walked in at 7:30 AM and the staff was great.  They let me seat myself anywhere I wanted.  I chose a table in the lounge so I could watch the 17 or so big screen TVs.  Two channels of ESPN were on, two screens of Chelsea footie, and 5 screens of the History Channel which seemed out of place in a video poker/sports bar.  

The important stuff - breakfast was great.  I had their Eggs Benedict.  They were tasty, and the Hollandaise had a nice, distinct flavor.  The breakfasts come with BAR potatoes and a nice bowl of fresh fruit.  My only detraction was my eggs were poached more than I like them, but that may be a health code because of possible salmonella.

The breakfast is listed on the menu for $9 and that's what the bill was for plus the tax.  No charge for coffee - it comes with the meal.  That's almost unheard of anymore!

We braved the downtown Scottsdale crowds and lack of parking on a Saturday night just so we could try the ice cream here.

Eating it in the car on the way back home, the more I ate, the more the ice cream tasted like cherry.  On second thought, I didn't taste any amaretto or rum in the ice cream either.  I couldn't taste any alcohol in the ice cream.  Then, I came to the realization that I was given a scoop of what tasted like cherry cheesecake ice cream, non-alcoholic, not strawberry amaretto rum, even though it was labeled as such.  Disappointed, it tasted OK, but I'm not a fan of cherry cheesecake in general, and I was wanting a signature alcoholic ice cream dessert.

In addition to more sweet items such as pancakes, French toast, Belgian waffles, and crepes, they also offer savory breakfasts such as skillets, omelettes, and scrambles.  The ingredients are very high quality, and they take a lot of care to make a great tasting meal for you.

Feeling like I was in a caffeine deficit, I decided to try out the caramel macchiato (A little over $4, can be made iced or hot).  It was a nice blend of sweetness and creaminess, and the coffee itself was very smooth.  The coffee drinks are served as a 16 oz. size, so although they are pricey, you get a good amount of drink for your money.

After poring through the extensive menu, I decided on the wildberry pancakes ($8.95).  They were moist, fluffy, with a nice selection of fresh berries (Blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries) on the side.  Sandwiched in-between the pancakes were a mix of blueberries and a berry-mascarpone filling.  The pancakes were also coated with a lovely drizzle of vanilla cream (Made with real vanilla bean) and berry sauce.  There was enough sweetness and creaminess in the dish that I didn't need to add any syrup at all, nor add any of the butter that was included as a side.  The only thing I didn't really like was that there was a small amount of the mascarpone filling, and since there was just a smattering of it, it tasted like hot cream cheese inside the hot pancakes (Not very appealing to me at least since you usually associate mascarpone/sweet cream fillings with cold temperature).

My friend had an egg-white omelette, which was quite possibly the fluffiest egg-white omelette I've seen, and quite fluffy compared to normal omelettes I've seen!  I had a taste, and it was really well-executed.  The flavors inside the omelette were perfect.  I also tried some of the chorizo skillet, which was a very good portion, with hearty amounts of chorizo, veggie, cheese, and potato.

We came here on a Sunday around 10 A.M. and waited about 20-25 minutes for 3 people.  Service was friendly and fast despite the busy atmosphere.  Butterfield's is definitely one of the top breakfast places to go if you don't mind the wait!",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We started with some cheese puffs and then we were each given a nice roll.  With the roll came to spreads, lardo and butter.  The lardo was superb!  Fatty, salty, and just the right accompaniment to a tasty roll.

Seven appetizers were next up served family style.  The items were grilled octopus with pickled vegetables and limoncello; carne cruda--their made to order chopped steak tartare; pastrami slices with two fried eggs and some greens; stracciatella; two wood platters of cured meats--one with mortadella, salumi, coppa, lomo, and nduja and one with prosciutto; and a dish of peppers, some stuffed with cheese.  With the appetizers, we got some sliced, toasted bread and some more lardo.  There were also more rolls brought to each person.

Next up we had two pastas--beef cheek ravioli topped with sliced white truffles and gnocchi with fresh cut figs.  

Next was the reason we were there--meat, in particular, their Riserva, a dry aged meat done in a way no other restaurant is.  Our two inch slice of Riserva was aged 254 days.  We also got a veal chop and a ribeye that was 100 day aged.  After showing all three meats on the table, they were cut table side and then placed back on the table.  With these meats, we had five vegetable dishes--mashed potatoes with an egg that was mixed into the potatoes at the table to make them creamier and tastier; Brussels sprouts, eggplant parmigiana, sautéed spinach, and thick cut garlic fries.

The meal ended with four desserts.  We had some cheesecake, panna cotta, a chocolate, peanut butter torte, and semifreddo.

The star of the evening was the Riserva.  The flavor is hard to describe.  There's a small bleu cheese flavor but the flavor comes from the oils from the fat that are in the meat.  We were warned to eat some of the ribeye first and then move on to the Riserva.  The difference was remarkable.  The appetizers and sides were good.  The vegetables should have been hotter.  Perhaps they were waiting too long while the meat was cut.

Service was outstanding.  Our waiter, Shepard, was on top of everything and he had a great personality that made dinner a little more special.

All in all, a special evening with some friends enjoying some good meat.  A return visit sometime is a must.",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I came here last night to use the comp and see the place before it closes and is reopened under the Clique Hospitality Group in February. Hence, this review will make no difference in the Yelp world as the place will be closing as it is soon.  I was at Mercadito for a Yelp event when it first opened, but it was a small tasting of tacos and guacamole.

Service was excellent!  Tyler was on the ball and was very good at making suggestions or answering questions.  Given that I generally don't get tacos in a restaurant like this, I looked on the menu for other items.  I got the tortilla soup for a starter followed by Pollo a las brasas--Peruvian in origin--for the main course.  The tortilla coup was quite good with lots of chicken, some tortilla strips but not overwhelmed with them like some other places.  I ordered a half order of the chicken which ended up being four pieces of chicken--bone in--with a wonderful spicy coating.  It's appearance is why they refer to it as blackened chicken.  The chicken was served with rice and a side of black beans with cotija cheese.

When it came to dessert, Tyler showed me the three item menu and said that the torrejas de bolillo was his favorite and he described it as a kind of Mexican bread pudding.  That's what I ordered and I was glad I did.  Rough cubes of Mexican bread soaked in crème anglaise with cajeta sauce and a scoop of ice cream.  The bread was baked in a cast iron round container.  It was a good way to end the meal.

In two sections--food and service--I'll review Technique and for the food I'm using description directly from the menu.

The Food:

A basket of three rolls was brought--one multi-grain, one rye, and one regular roll.  The herbed butter served with them was very good!

Course 1:  I chose the Beef carpaccio with charred beef sirloin. Shaved Parmesan. Truffle oil. Balsamic reduction. Black pepper. Field greens.

The salad was very good.  The balsamic reduction dressing was very tasty and the field greens were fresh.  The problem here was with the prep.  The beef was placed on the salad plates some time before the salad was created.  It had then been refrigerated--nearly to freezing it seemed.  As a result, the thin beef slices stuck to the plate.  I can understand the need to avoid exposing the carpaccio to room temperatures, but this was really a cold plate.  The server asked me if I wanted freshly ground pepper and she used the peppermill.  Nice touch.

Course 2:  Pork tenderloin saltimbocca.  prosciutto, sage butter, asparagus, risotto, Marsala semi glacé.  The pork was cooked way too long making its name incorrect.  Instead of being tender, it was difficult to cut and much of the flavor was wrung from the pork.  The prosciutto on top was very good and the risotto was not bad considering it was made in advance and piped from a pastry bag and kept warm in some hit water.  There were two asparagus pieces, a little meager even given the reasonable price of the meal. The server asked about freshly ground pepper for the main course, too, which was welcome.

Course 3:  Chocolate lava cake. Peanut butter ganache and vanilla bean ice cream.  The problem with dessert was that the chocolate cake was very dry.  Either it was older or it was baked too much.  The peanut butter ganache was nice and the vanilla bean ice cream was good.

The service:

The woman who served my table greeted me when she came with the menu but did not identify herself by name and she did not tell me the soup of the day nor the catch of the day.  It was when I heard a different server at the table behind me introduce himself by name and then list the unpublished things on the menu that I knew they existed.

My server was attentive, came back during each course to see if everything was OK.  She refilled my iced tea without asking, but I had to request the sweetener a couple of minutes after she brought my glass of iced tea.

I'm not sure if it was the server or the school, but I would recommend not bringing the bill while I'm eating dessert.  Can't it wait?  Also, it really is best to clear the table of dirty dishes before bringing the bill back.  You do need to have some room to put the holder down and sign the charge without moving plates aside.  The removal of used sweetener packets was a fail.  

In spite of the things I found wrong with the dinner, I will be going back.  It was interesting watching the students prepare the dishes through the glass of the kitchen.  The food was passable, and hopefully the students and staff from Le Cordon Bleu read reviews and improve from the reviews.  I was told the menu changes every 3 to 4 months.  I'll give it some time and then I'll stop in again!

Edit:  The price is now $18.95 for a 3 course meal and that includes non-alcohol beverage.",5,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Elniño, a friend from Yelp, and I met for lunch at Poppy Den today to try this addition to Tivoli Village.  It was a perfect winter day so we decided to eat out on the patio.  

For the first course, I chose Amma's homemade tomato soup with curried whipped cream, cilantro, and extra virgin olive oil.  The tomato soup was very good.  I didn't think the curry whipped cream added anything to the dish but color.  The EVOO on the other had helped bring out the tomato flavor.

The second course was monk fish with onion jam and dill ginger, garlic and coriander.  The fish was cooked perfectly and had a good flavor.  It was a nice light fish for a lunch.

We also shared an order of quinoa fried rice.  We both enjoyed this.

The third course was chips and ice cream.  There were two kinds of homemade ice cream, yuzu and poppyseed and lemon and poppyseed accompanied by potato chips stacked vertically in the ice cream.  The homemade chips had good grains of salt on them which countered the ice cream beautifully.

Service was good. Our server and I talked about Little Finland in the Gold Butte area of Nevada and we talked about going there with/without 4 wheel drive.  He was a pleasant server!

I enjoyed the lunch and the day was so beautiful with temperatures nearing 80.  At the end of lunch, the sun on my back became almost too warm and we made a retreat through the restaurant to our respective cars.",5,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We went here on a Friday night, and prices were $21.99 for adults, not including drinks.  There's a plethora of options that will please just about anyone that comes here to dine. These options include standardized Americanized Chinese food (Like orange chicken and chow mein), various salads, a carving station (They had pork ribs, kielbasa sausage, and prime rib when we went), sashimi and sushi (nigiri and rolls), hibachi, seafood (Such as crab legs, steamed clams, raw oyster, shrimp cocktail, and various Chinese seafood concoctions), and dessert.  

The menu for the most part echoes a lot of the food you'll see at Pacific Seafood Buffet in Chandler or Crazy Buffet in Tempe, except for the carving station.  As for the quality of food, it's pretty good for the most part.  Out of everything I tried, I was most leery of the oyster though.  I took a tentative bite, only to discover it had a pond-like taste to it, and was very gritty.  The other seafood items were much better.  The crab legs were salty, but the meat inside was sweet and tender.  The sushi rolls seemed a little bland and were dry from age, but the sashimi was better.  They had thinly sliced pieces of white tuna, salmon, octopus, and snapper when I went.  The Chinese food was pretty good, on par with Pacific Buffet, and the prime rib was tender.

Dessert included various ice creams and gelato (Such as coconut, mango, and mint chocolate chip), mousse cakes, cheesecakes, carrot cake, German chocolate cake, custard, and cream puffs, just to name a few!  There is also a fresh and canned fruit section at the end of the salad section.  I tried some coconut gelato and various cakes.  The cakes were fresh and tasty, and the gelato had a nice refreshing coconut taste, although the texture had a weird gummy quality.

Service was very attentive.  Drinks and plates were refilled and taken away promptly.  At the end of our meal we got a coupon for the regular buffet, and for their happy hour.  We did get $5 off our meal total by checking into Yelp and using a check-in deal, which made the price a little more reasonable.

Pat bing soo) is served in a disposable Styrofoam bowl instead of a glass bowl, probably for easier clean up.  They've expanded their drink menu, but my favorite is still the fresh fruit smoothies where you can mix up to 3 fruits for a refreshing cool beverage.

The main component of Little India is a store with various Indian goods and foods, with a refrigerated section selling freshly made sweets. The actual restaurant is in the back, and to order, get an order card from the cashier in the front and check off what you would like. You can pay for your selections with the cashier in the front after receiving your food. 

I browsed through the menu and decided on one of the specials- bhatura, pickled veggies, rice, and mattar paneer. It was a good portion of each component, with the slightly greasy bhatura flatbread, piquant crisp vegetables, white rice, and richly flavored mattar paneer. The only negative about the mattar paneer was that the peas were overcooked, and thus grey and a bit mushy. They don't hold back on the heat, and for those that like more mild food, you've been warned!

Service was pleasant from the front and the back. Prices are very reasonable. The special was $5.99 and I was full after only eating half my meal. I also grabbed a container of gulab jamun ($4.99) from the refrigerated dessert section which contained a lot of the sweet dumplings and was pretty good. 

Definitely a good option for tasty yet cheap Indian food!",3,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
DW0ZvWuYaSvMcB_3LG5RGg,1,2012-09-23,0,oOYWAKzknENdmbCT4fsWag,3,"I'm conflicted about writing this review because I was going to give a lower rating.   I was so hungry after spending 3.5 hours volunteering at the aid station for the Viva Bike Vegas 2012 ride that I could have eaten a take out menu and thought it was good.

This was my first time here and I had researched Yelp reviews and their online menu.  I ordered from the take out window one order of chicken lettuce wraps and a large hot and sour soup.  The lettuce wraps were very good.  I am a salt lover, but the sauce made the wraps salty even for me.  But, I still enjoyed them.

The hot and sour soup had a rich taste but I'm not used to having ground meat in hot and sour soup.  It's generally small slices of pork.  The texture was a bit of a turn off and I didn't think the soup was that spicy.

My biggest issue was service.  I realize I was a walk in at 4:30 on a Saturday evening.  There were four people in the restaurant at the time.  There were some take out orders to be made but there was never less than three cooks working behind the counter and before I got my meal, there were 5 total.  I probably waited 15 minutes.  I saw the one cook pick up and handful of rice sticks and toss it into the take out box--no gloves, no tongs--just bare hands.  Also, the soup was ladled into the take out container and just left on the metal shelf for 10 minutes while the other things were being prepared.

When the counter critter brought my bag, she apologized for the long wait.  I watched this place as it was being built and never stopped.  That's been about 10 years.  I guess I can wait again before I return.  The lettuce wraps saved the rating from being 2 stars.",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I made a reservation for 7:30 and arrived on time.  I accidentally came in the back door via the patio and was shown to the hostess podium by a nice woman hereafter referred to as NW.  After checking in at the podium, and asking to be seated on the patio, NW took me outside and said that all the booths were filled but I could have any table.  I chose a table that was set for only two people to minimize removing place settings.  NW left menus with me and said that my server would be with me shortly.

The server brought the menus and took my drink order.  He seemed a bit overwhelmed with the number of tables he was covering but he eventually came back with my iced tea and took my order.  I asked his advice on the entrée and I took it.

Quite some time went by and NW had come by and said, ""Didn't *server* get here yet.  I told NW that he had taken my order.  After another wait, the server came out with two drinks for another table and my cup of tomato soup.  He first stopped to give the drinks to that table and before he got to me, NW said, ""Didn't he bring your soup?  I thought I saw him with it.""  I told her it was on his tray and she was happy.

I had just started my soup when NW came out with my entrée.  She apologized for how soon things were appearing.  I was very close to telling her to take it back, but I thought it would sit under a heat lamp and then be brought back out.  I made a split second decision to let her leave the dish with me.

The tomato soup was very good but I wish I had more time to enjoy it but I hurriedly finished it to get to the lamb meatball pasta.  When I tasted the pasta, it was still hot so I cut a little break for that.  Perhaps if the place was busier things wouldn't have been so quick.

The menu describes the pasta this way--poblano cream sauce, red pepper, goat cheese, black pepper fettuccine.  The poblano cream had a nice zing to it and the small amount of goat cheese could be used to cut the heat if you wanted.  The meatballs were kind of dry.  The poblano cream sauce and the pepper fettuccine made the dish, flavor wise.  The fettuccine had become stuck together and I was given no spoon to twirl the pasta on.  Since the soup dish had not yet been cleared, I used the soup spoon to twirl the pasta but it came in very long lengths because of this sticking together.

For dessert, I got their S'mores brownie, a long brownie topped with marshmallow that was brûléed and had three thin ginger snap cookies placed in the marshmallow.  There was also a dip of marshmallow ice cream.  As it turned out, dessert was the best part of the meal.

NW came by a few times to see how things were and my server was around more often as the patio emptied of all patrons except for two dog hugging young women who took up a lot of my server's time.  

For the experience, the food would have been better if it had been timed better.  There's no excuse for NW to bring my entrée when she already knew I had just gotten my soup.  What was she thinking?  

The place is Downtown Summerlin priced (this may become the local version of ""Strip prices) and without the $10 discount card, the place wouldn't merit the 3 stars.  Too bad, because for the most part, the food was good.  They've been open about 6 months and they still don't have their act together.  That's sad.

None of the other people at our table really enjoyed their dinners either, ranging from a fish entree to a burrito platter.  One of the servers dropped my knife on my coat, and got salsa over the sleeve.  Her reaction?  A quick ""sorry"" and she scurried away.

I arrived about 5:15 and was seated in a rather empty restaurant except for a private party in one room.  I was seated immediately and my server, Mike, came over and ask for drink order and let me know if I had any questions about the menu to ask.  He got my iced tea.

I ordered a cup of black bean soup and the coconut shrimp.  The bean soup was brought in a short time drizzled with a back and forth with a cilantro-crema.  The crema didn't really give the soup any flavor.  It seems it was more decorative than functional. 

The main course--coconut shrimp--was brought with the correct amount of break between appetizer and main.  The shrimp were good and it had been quite awhile since I had coconut shrimp which I like.  It was served broccoli and yellow rice.  The shrimp were good but I think it would be better as an appetizer than a main.  

For dessert, I got the chocolate island, a dessert the menu describes as ""rich chocolate mousse on a fudge brownie island in chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise.""  It was a very good dessert and the best part of the meal.

My server, Tony, answered some questions I had about the menu and he told me about some specials.  I ordered a small Caesar salad for a starter.  For the main, he recommended the fish tacos and I went with that.  For dessert, I again took his recommendation and ordered the carrot cake.  It was good following his advice!

The Cesar salad was a normal one, nothing special.  They could have left the hard piece of bread with baked cheese on it.  The bread was indeed hard and there was no cheese flavor.  It looked better than it tasted.

I have only gotten fish tacos once before so this was almost a new entrée for me.  The tacos were filled to the brim.  The mahi mahi was tasty, there was some slaw, and each taco had a slice of avocado along with some chipotle aioli.  There were three side containers of sour cream, guacamole, and pico.  The tacos were juicy and messy eating, but worth it.  

The carrot cake was a gigantic slice of goodness.  It was rich cake with a good cream cheese icing and nuts sprinkled liberally on the icing.

You are paying Strip prices for tacos you could get from a street vendor for much less.  The restaurant was almost empty and the quiet was enjoyable.  Tony was a great server and I'm glad I gave Citizens a try.",10,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The patio itself is very nice and has a lot of well shaded areas to keep you cool from the hot sun.  We had breakfast here, which was a mixed experience meal-wise.  I had the Hawaiian French toast ($8.75) which was disappointing to me.  The only thing that seemed to make it Hawaiian was a few slices of banana placed on top of the French toast.  The menu listed a molasses batter for the toast, but I couldn't taste much molasses flavor.  In addition, the toast itself looked overcooked and tasted dry.  For $8.75, I would have liked to see more ingredients than some slices of banana on top of 2 sliced pieces of battered toast (Maybe some pineapple? Or grilled ham?).

My husband had the biscuits and gravy platter (Around $10), which I thought was much better value wise and taste wise.  The gravy was rich and delicious, and it was a large amount of food since it came with bacon, potatoes, and 2 eggs.  I also tried the short rib benedict, which was nicely cooked, with great flavor.

The Plaza is pretty much the same as it was before but new.  There is new carpeting, new slot machines, and new table game pit tables.  The layout is the same as before, but it has a fresher look.  They are also putting a nice scent into the air and the place wasn't smoky last night like it used to be.  The air flow must have been improved.

The new Insurgo Theatre Movement theatre is on the 3rd floor next to the bingo room.  The theatre was a cabaret from the looks of what I saw last night.  It's odd to go to a play and have a nicely dressed cocktail waitress delivering drinks while actors are delivering lines (well only once).  She was also sufficiently unclothed to be worthy of the title of a Las Vegas cocktail server.  She was also really pleasant.

The garage is still the awful thing it's always been.  The 2nd floor was mostly blocked off because this is Bikefest 2011 (motorcycles), so they had an area reserved for those noise makers.

There was a lot of security everywhere last night and Metro and they may be due to the Bikefest,

Fort such a little shop, there were so many different things from which to choose.  I walked from table to table looking at the cakes, breads, and pastures and reading the names on them.  Some were missing names.

In the long run, I got a small bag of 3 French style macarons, a slice of chocolate cake, and a small bag of mini cinnamon rolls.  The macarons were OK but the filling was definitely not French.  It was a cream like filling.  Regardless, they were good.  My wife had the cake slice and liked it.  The best of the three items was the package of cinnamon rolls.  They're very good!

You wouldn't even know this was a conference room if it weren't for the signs that our coordinator put up to guide us to the spot. I had to actually walk away from the ballroom where the other rooms were, go outside past the patio, go up a flight of stairs, and then walk some more past the tennis and basketball court to get to the room. There wasn't even a restroom on that floor, we had to walk some distance down the stairs again to reach the one stall restroom next to the stairs on ground level.

The room itself was comfortable enough and I could hear the lecturers OK, but it was really chilly so I'm glad I brought a sweater. During break time, after looking at the exorbitant prices for food at the two restaurants here I went off site for lunch where I did discover a few nice spots for a quick and less inexpensive bite to eat less than a mile away (Slanted Rice and Modern Market). 

Because of the weird layout I got lost here a lot. There were a lot of times when I entered the hotel that I went the complete opposite direction. A person from a different conference in the main conference rooms actually had to direct me to where my particular room was! 

Parking was of course on the very opposite side of the hotel but I guess it did allow me to walk off whatever I ate for breakfast and lunch. Parking spots were plentiful and I had no problems finding a spot at any time.

My friend and I were interested in taking a self-defense class, and had heard that Krav Maga is one of the best in that it's more real-world training vs. other martial arts where you practice pretty looking kicks that might not be very practical if you need to defend yourself.  The intro class was $20, and included a 30 minute intro session, 1 hour beginner group session, a free t-shirt, and hand wraps.  Not a bad deal if I may say.  

I used to take kenpo, and unfortunately I learned a lot of strikes and moves that don't really apply to self-defense krav-maga style.  So, during the group class a good portion of my time was spent trying to deprogram the way I block and punch.  Also, I tend to have the coordination of a drunk elephant, so some of the group practices were probably pretty entertaining for others watching me practice.  

In general, compared to kenpo, krav maga is more instinctual, and based more on defense in-the-moment.  I generally have slow reaction time and it takes me several tries to learn a new move, so it was a little awkward for me during the class, but I do feel like I learned a lot.  

The class I went to was fairly large, maybe around 15-18 people, with about 5 women.  They offer classes during different times in the day, on different days, with Saturday classes as well.  They also offer a women's class if you feel more comfortable starting out practicing with other women.

For our main course, we chose the spicy chicken rigatoni described on the menu as chicken breast, garlic, crushed red pepper and peas in a spicy rosa sauce.  This came with a recommendation from a friend and it was a good suggestion.  (Thanks Shawn H.)  The bowl of rigatoni was huge.  Note that the menu states that a small order is meant for 2 or more and a large order is meant for 4 or more.  We had generous servings at the restaurant, not overdoing it though, and we brought home a container for an additional meal.

Since we didn't overdo the main course, we had room for dessert.  They have a couple of desserts that have single serving versions (well actually they're also for 2 people in reality).  We got their single serving version of the colossal brownie sundae.  It came with two brownie pieces, two scoops of ice cream and some whipped cream.  A very nice dessert for two people to share.

Items served were:

Charcuterie platter with lardo and culatello ham
Lamb tartare with bhatura bread
Hearth baked bread
Artichoke with white bean hummus, charred tomatillo, mortared herbs, pine nuts & arugula
Butcher wings
Beef skewer
Black truffle meatballs with bonito flakes
Chinatown clams on the half shell
Duck breast with foie gras
Lamb ragu with udon noodles
Beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings
Sweetbreads with grilled romaine hearts, smoked bacon, English peas & fond blanc
Tres Leches--vanilla bean, orange and cocoa nib crunch
Calamansi tart with vanilla meringue and blueberries
Black sesame crêpe with cherry yuzu, marmalade, and whipped cream

With the selection we opted for, there was something for everyone.  The charcuterie platter was nicely done with the N'duja being tops in flavor.  The lamb tartare was very good with the apple and walnuts, as were the black truffle meatballs topped with bonito flakes.  Another favorite of mine was the duck breast with foie gras.  The beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings need work.  The dumpling was very chewy. 

Of the desserts we tried, the Calamansi tart and the tres leches were my picks.  The tart was excellent and the tart was a good sized dish meant for sharing.

Service was very good and the music was at a level that allowed conversation while still being able to hear the music.  Later as more people arrived, the sound in the restaurant picked up but it was never loud.

It's a little pricey for the size of the servings but the quality of the food, the preparation, and the presentation make it worth it.",18,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I made a reservation and arrived 5 minutes before time and was shown to my table.  I like how they've redone the room.  It's a bit brighter and a bit classier.

After looking over the menu, I ordered the beer and cheese bisque, the wagyu sirloin, and a baked sweet potato.  For dessert I got the chocolate espresso cake.  I was brought water and the iced tea I ordered quickly and the tea was always replenished without asking.  Between my server Chad and his helper Karl, I was well looked after during my meal.

They bring you a tray with some fresh bread, sloft butter, and an assortment of olives and veggies to snack on to get you started.

The soup was good.  I got the steak cooked blue with blue cheese on top.  It was cooked right and the taste of the steak was good.  The baked sweet potato had a cinnamon sugar butter that was too heavy on the sugar.  A little bit perhaps to cut the cinnamon but this butter was overly sweet.  

When it came time for dessert, I ordered the chocolate espresso cake and a double espresso.  Both were good.  The photos of the cake don't do justice to how LARGE it was.  Layers of light and dark chocolate with some coffee flavor.  The espresso was string.  I knew that after midnight when I was still staring at the ceiling.

The service was outstanding!  The table was always patrolled for removing used plates or removing empty sweetener packets.  The soup and steak were OK--good but nothing outstanding.  The sweet potato needs to be served with the butter on the side to let the customer decide on how much to use is at all.",16,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We had an appetizer, pizza, and dessert.  The appetizer was the GuacaTony, which was amazing.  It had a very large portion of fresh guacamole with perfectly crispy cheesy pizza/flatbread to eat it with.  I also had some of the toasted ravioli which was nicely breaded and toasty, with a bit of spicy kick to it.  I wasn't too impressed with the pizza though.  We had ordered a pizza on the thin crust wheat, and it looked like a bunch of pizza toppings placed on a large, circular cracker.

It was about 6:30 and other than one table, I was the only person in the restaurant.  I took a seat at the bar so I could watch the cooking in front of me.  Not much cooking as for most of the time I was there, the only cooking done was  for my order.

My server was Noriko, a very pleasant woman who explained the menu to me and explained what kushi-age was and explained the ordering process.  She brought my iced tea and I was set to begin ordering.

I started with a tapas plate of Tuna yukke which is seasoned big eye tuna with a quail egg on top.  The tuna is accompanied by some thinly sliced cucumber, red onion, and yellow bell pepper.  The tuna was very good.

Next, I ordered these kushi-age items:  King oyster mushroom, bacon wrapped asparagus, pork filet, curry beef tongue, octopus leg, and black tiger shrimp.  I watched the cook dip my selections in the batter and then drop them into the hot oil which he tended closely and turned the items with his chopsticks.  In a short time, the items were removed from the frying oil and placed on the plate.  Noriko then arranged them on a plate.  When she brought them to me, she told me the order they were on the plate.

With the kushi-age, you get a cabbage salad with some sliced carrots.  They also have a variety of sauces you can get or just stay with their original kushi-age dipping sauce which was what I did.  You also get a small dish with two sections--one containing curry powder and one with red sea salt.  I found that the curry powder was the best accompaniment.  Of the 6 kushi-age items I got, hands down, the best was the curry beef tongue.  Dipped with extra curry powder, it was a winner.

Service was good.  I was somewhat uneasy in the restaurant.  The counter area is adjacent to the kitchen entrance.  Since there was almost no one else in the restaurant, I felt like the three servers were watching me all the time I was there.  It made for the good service I mentioned, but because the restaurant is so small and the counter is near their workstation, I felt really watched--not in a bad way, mind you.

I'm glad I gave Yu-Yu a try.  It's interesting.  The value is not good.  While in line with other tapas style restaurants, the amount of food per price is not good.",6,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Opening up in the spot where Ocean Buffet used to be, the parking lot was chaotic around lunchtime but there were plenty of spots at least. When I entered the line was already stretching around the corner of the restaurant but it moved fast with the two cashiers at the front. Browsing through the menu they offer mainly meat based items, in chicken, chorizo or beef form. I decided to keep it simple and get a machaca burro to go.

They will give you a number and call it out when it is ready. I looked at my receipt and saw that 30 other numbers were before my order! How's that for popularity. They all came out swiftly and I wasn't waiting too long. Before I left I got a small container of salsa from the side bar. By early lunchtime it seemed like at least half the large pump style salsa containers were already empty. 

I got home and dug into my burro with gusto! The meat was well seasoned, tender and juicy. The tortilla was soft and fresh and held up to the juicy meat well. The salsa was perfect with the burro and had a medium heat level. The total was less than $5. Not bad!

The toppings are plentiful and I like the small magnets that hold the little trays open while you get a topping.  Check out was quick and the register person was very pleasant.

The prices for the food and drinks are high but that's to be expected of comedy clubs. Note that there is a 2 drink minimum.

You will be sandwiched in with other people as close as it is legally possible so throw your notions of personal space out the door haha.

Food is your typical bar food, with sandwiches, burgers, and various munchies such as pretzels, nachos and wings. If you are having a dry night, they offer Coke products and for $13.95 you can get the unlimited soda which satisfies the 2 drink minimum requirement.

I tried some of the burger and fries. The burger was a decent size and tasted alright. The fries were lightly crispy and hot. Is it $14 good? Well no, but everything here's a bit higher priced than normal anyways.

C2 is the sibling range of Caswell's, which shares the same owner. As a result, memberships here can be upgraded to include Caswell's access for an extra fee. If you are going a la carte, range time is per hour, per person. There are 23 lanes, very well ventilated with nice touch screens to program your lane distance. The screens are easy enough to operate, but just be aware that if you've been to Caswell's, they operate slightly differently. We had no problems using the range though, and the range officers themselves were very helpful and friendly.

The floor showroom is quite large and hosts quite an array of different firearms, including some impressive 50 caliber Barretts. As for instruction, they offer the same type of classes as Caswell's, and they start in April. The only negative I found was that you have to use the C2 brand targets, which aren't that expensive, but still puts a damper on your experience if you already bought some targets to practice with.

Compared to Caswell's, there are more lanes, and the facility is bigger and newer. Although I do like going to Caswell's, it's a little bit of a drive for me from where I live. The closer location of C2 allows me more opportunities to get some range time on a work day, vs. dealing with the crowds that you find typically at the ranges here on the weekends. Due to the convenient location, very nice facility, and welcoming, friendly staff, this is definitely going to be my favorite for indoor target practice!

I was seated promptly and given a menu.  Someone quickly came for drink order and I soon had my iced tea.  After asking my server, Andrea, some questions about portion sizes, I went with a Caesar salad to start and veal marsala for my main course.  I was brought bread that was accompanied by three butters--one regular, one pesto flavored, and one olive flavored. 

My salad was quite large and it was very good.  Light on the dressing but heavy with the cheese and the cheese is done a different way.  The parmesan slices are baked in a bowl and broken and put in pieces under and throughout the salad.  This baking gives the cheese extra flavor and I really enjoyed the salad.

The veal was very good.  The marsala sauce was rich and flavorful.  With the dish came a choice of side--either pasta or potato--and I took the daily pasta of ziti with marinara.  This was a good dish of pasta.

I asked Andrea for her recommendation on dessert.  She to;d me her favorite was cannoli, but I have been disappointed by some restaurants in the past with cannoli so I went with her second choice--their house made tiramisu.  It was very good  with mascarpone, lady fingers, espresso and Belgian cocoa.  The espresso was not overpowering and the same for the cocoa.  It was a perfectly balanced, creamy, tasty ending to the meal.

Service was excellent!  All the servers and bussers constantly circulated through the two rooms.  No table was just one person's.

The owner helped move two extra tables to a booth and we had enough room for the 15 or so of us who descended on the place.

Four of us decided to get one sandwich each and split the sandwiches into quarters so that we could each try a little bit of several sandwiches.  It was a super idea.  We ordered a Streetcar which has shrimp, oysters, and catfish.  Sandwich two was the Bourbon Street--roast beef with gravy.  The third sandwich was the Crescent City, a muffuletta.  The fourth was a Marie Laveau which is boudin sausage.  We also had a Pirogue, a crawfish boudin because an error was made and they brought the wrong sandwich, but left it with us to enjoy while they made the correct one.  Most of the sandwiches came with chips and a small side of cole slaw.

With our sandwiches, we ordered three sides--deep fried macaroni and cheese, hush puppies, and corn fritters.  

Everything was simply great!!  The bread is from the Leidenheimer Baking Company in New Orleans and is flown here for Streetcar.  The fillings in the sandwiches were excellent.  My favorite was Marie Laveua, the boudin sausage Po-boy.  The deep freind mac and cheese was excellent as were the corn fritters.

For dessert, they brought us some praline King Cake they were trying out.  It was very flavorful.  Michael U. had pre-ordered a King Cake and they were waiting for us to come before they dressed the cake so the icing and other things on top were fresh.  I have not yet tried my King Cake because I'm still in a food coma.

Service was very, very good.  Gwen, the owner, was a wonderful, welcoming person who made us feel at home at her piece of NOLA in Las Vegas.  Our main server D'nis was very good and a friendly person.  Gwen gave the three young ones in the group a small stuffed animal.  That was very kind of her.

In the piece of praline King Cake I got was the baby that's baked into the cake.  That means I have to buy the next King Cake or host the next Mardi Gras gathering.  OK, Mel C., Terri R., and Michael U., put this on your calendar for next year.  We return, get four sandwiches and some sides again, and I'm buying.

I attended a play at the West Career and Technical Academy in their ""black box"" theatre in Building F.  I use quotes for black box because the program notes that the space is borrowed from the engineering teachers.  The sound quality isn't what you would generally expect from a theatre.  The space was set up well with risers so the audience had good sight lines.  I'm guessing the space holds about 80 people the way it's configured.  

The school opened in August of 2010 so it's a new campus.  The school is very clean and the parking is adequate for the number of students who drive.  Being a lifelong educator, it pains me to see security cameras in the hallways and the parking lots, but I know it's part of what our society is.

The menu consists of your standard Mediterranean fare with some pastries and Turkish coffee thrown into the mix. I decided on the vegetarian mix ($10.99) which includes rice, grape leaves, hummus, falafel, pita bread, salad, and tzatziki sauce. Quite a lot for a meal!

The hummus was my favorite of all the elements in the meal. It was smooth and creamy with a delicate light flavor. The falafel was light and crispy, and the salad was bright, colorful, with lots of veggies and a delightful vinaigrette. Even the rice was well seasoned. The grape leaves were a little too mushy for me but they had good acidic flavor.

I got my meal to go and it was well packaged.

Overall I'll go here again to try more dishes.",18,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The rooms can be chilly but are spacious and I haven't had any problems hearing the speakers. There is easy access to any restrooms, although some weren't fully stocked last time I attended an event here. There are multiple trash and recycle bins around the center to prevent littering, and there are a variety of restaurants as well as a locally owned coffee shop in the food court area. 

The one thing that I find a little weird at this particular convention center is that the exhibit halls are on the upper level which I'd imagine makes it harder for vendors to haul and set up their booths and supplies. 

Since parking can be hard to find and/or expensive in the downtown area there is easy access to the convention center using the light rail. For $4 you can get an all day pass and it will drop you off right at 3rd and Washington. Note that if you are traveling back from the convention center and are heading East the light rail stop will be one block south at Jefferson and 3rd St.",26,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Review is for the Restaurant Week 2011 menu:

This was the first time I was at Vintner Grill even though it's only about a mile from where I live.  I decided to give the place a try with its Restaurant Week menu and I was not disappointed.

Course 1 was crispy calamari with a lemon and curry aioli and some haricot verts.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and I liked that besides rings they had tentacles mixed in.  The lemon and curry aioli was a very tasty dipping sauce.  5/5

Course 2 was veal scaloppini with crimini mushrooms, lemon, marsala and capellini with olive oil.  The marsala sauce was superb in its richness and the crimini mushrooms added god flavor.  The capellini was a bit bland.  It needed some salt and for my taste a bit of grated cheese to bring out the richness of the olive oil.  4.5/5

Course 3 was a dessert of a gorgonzola panna cotta with a cherry compote and some sesame tuile.  The panna cotta was very light as it should be and had a mild flavor.  The cherry compote paired well with the lightness of the panna cotta.  The tuile was placed across the plate in the panna cotta.  Presentation was quite nice.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated.  I appreciate the fact that they start dinner service at 4.  I had a reservation for 4:30 as I needed to eat, run home and put my shorts back on, and head to a play at Spring Mountain Ranch State Park.  Service was excellent.  My server was polite and efficient.  The music loop was more for gray hairs like me.  The place was quiet, but it was early and there weren't many diners yet.  I do wish we could dispense with the TVs at the bar, but this is Las Vegas and almost any bar needs one or more TVs.",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I was greeted quickly and seated in the quiet place.  There were only a few other diners and the TV playing ESPN was in mute mode with closed captions so it was a very pleasant interior.

There are about 10 lunch specials all $7.50.  You get a cup of egg drop soup, an egg roll, rice, and the dish of your choice.  After ordering a Thai iced tea, I ordered the Thai mint chicken.  Their spiciness level is on a scale of 1 to 5 and I went with 4.  I was soon brought the soup which was standard.  It was just lukewarm.  It could have been much hotter temperature wise.

I met some friends here for breakfast at the store and then we did the walk.  There is a lot of stuff here.  Most of the store is filled with things I don't need but was fun to look at and explore nonetheless.

I found the first floor, with its kitchen gadgets and cookware to be the most interesting part of the store and the reason I'd go back.

You can get to other places in the store without following the long path.  Look for the short cut signs above the aisle.

I did find the spaces that had designated room sizes that had appliances and furniture that would fit into that size area to be quite interesting.  Great marketing concept.

IKEA is OK but if I wanted furniture or appliances, I'd go elsewhere.  It's easier.  Maybe not as much fun or as interesting, but it would be easier.

Off I went on Spring Mountain Road and after looking for a bit on the second floor of this mostly Asian food mall, I found Café Teaze on the west side of the building.  

I also noted that Roger T. was already checked in here and he had created a UYE to celebrate Tony's birthday.  I opened the door and walked in to Café Teaze to see lovely ladies and some Yelp friends.  I had been a bit reticent to come here alone, so now there was safety in numbers.  Soon others arrived and we had a fine time.

One of the ladies came for my order and I got an iced taro milk tea with boba.  Tony told me that was his favorite drink--hot--so next time I'll try it that way.  The tea was excellent.  It's served in a mason jar with a handle.

I soon learned that they have snacks and I got the chance to try some popcorn chicken Taiwanese style.  Wow, great!!  

The concept is fun and the ladies certainly provide great eye candy serving wearing only lingerie.  It's difficult to keep from staring and that's OK because that's part of Café ´Teaze. I guess you could call it no guilt ogling. 

I surely won't get the number of check ins Tony has, but I'll be back--for the food, of course.  Oh, and the tea!  It's sort of like getting Playboy solely for the articles.

I didn't order a starter because I knew I'd eat enough in chips and salsas to make up for that.  My server, Celina, was at my table quickly to take my iced tea order and it was quickly brought.  It was also refilled without asking several times during dinner.

I ordered the carne asada with it cooked rare.  When the meal came, I was stunned at the size of it.  There were refried beans, rice, grilled peppers and onions, sour cream, guacamole, and pico, tortillas, and a large amount of perfectly cooked rare steak.  On the back of the platter was a whole Mexican street corn cob.

The beans and rice were standard.  The street corn was good but the star of the show was the carne asada.  The meat was rare and tender and I enjoyed it very much.

I had so much to eat I was rethinking my need to get dessert.  Well, that thought went by the wayside quickly.  I ordered coconut flan.  This was the only let down of the menu.  The flan was a little heavier and not as soft as one normally gets.  Also, I could only discern a small coconut flavor in the flan itself.  The coconut flavor came from the coconut spread on the dish.  The caramel topping was just overwhelming.  It detracted and overpowered the flan rather than adding to the flavor.  It was also a reason why the coconut in the flan just didn't come through.

Service was very good between Celina and a runner who was there with iced tea and ready to be of help.

I really enjoyed this spur of the moment trip to the Silverton.",15,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

There were four parties, including ours, with 10 or more people yesterday and the staff handled it well.  The kitchen was a bit overwhelmed so our orders took longer than normal, but it was fine because we weren't in a hurry.

I ordered the soup and 1/2 sandwich.  For soup I ordered the tortilla soup.  The sandwich was the turkey Cobb.  The soup was outstanding.  The tortilla strips are in the bowl and the warm soup was poured overtop so they retained their crispness.  There was also some pieces of avocado and the flavor of cilantro was very present for a wonderful flavor.  I was a bit disappointed in the sandwich.  It was billed as roasted turkey.  Well, it was, but it was luncheon meat roasted turkey and sliced thin for the sandwich.  It also says with blue cheese dressing.  It was there but the blue cheese flavor was not.

As for our server, she was really good.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass when I got low.  She did commit a cardinal sin with one of my friends.  He ordered another beer and when she brought it, she picked up his unfinished first glass and removed it before he could stab her with his fork.  That's a big no no!!  She didn't do that with the little iced tea that was left in my glass when she brought the fresh glass.  Wow, were we surprised.

This was an extremely enjoyable meal.  I got here early enough I could sit on their patio overlooking the Fountains of Bellagio.  They had 8 LP heaters cranking out the warmth and it was great.  Nothing says success like location, location, location.  On with the meal.

You get a nice basket of bread and lavash and a three section dish with olive tapenade and olives.  One section has green olive tapenade, the middle has a small olive assortment, and the last section has a ripe olive tapenade.  The tapenade with the bread and the lavash is almost addictive.  Ask your server and you'll get the recipe they use for making the tapenade. 

Course 1:  I ordered the crispy lamb lollipops with sweet corn raita, Calvados demi-glaze, Za'atar carrots, and Greek yogurt.  The description comes from their Restaurant Week menu.  It was very good, but it was poorly named.  I expected some kind of different use of lamb to create a lollipop.  Instead, they were lamb ribs.  They were tasty with a nice crispness, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  The corn was an excellent accompaniment.

Course 2:  I got the Airline chicken breast on a bed of lobster mac and cheese with broccoli florets and ""Truffle Fondue, Buttered Broccoli Florets, Marsala Jus, Toasted Bread Crumbs.""  The quoted part is from their description.  The word fondue is used very loosely.  The chicken was nicely grilled and seasoned well.  The meat was very juicy.

Course 3:  I got the Strawberry Mascarpone cheesecake with the center filled with a rhubarb mixture.  Excellent dessert.

Service was very good.  It was relaxed although the place was crowded and I was taking up a primo spot on the patio.  Iced tea was refilled often.  The courses were spaced nicely so I got to enjoy 3 fountain shows during the meal.  It really is a nice spot, and it's a place to which I'll return.  That after all is part of why restaurants participate in Restaurant Week.",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The weekend buffet today included several chicken dishes, 2 biriyani dishes, veggie dishes, a seafood/fish dish, and a goat curry. Some notable examples were chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, saag, and paneer makhani. Out of all the dishes I enjoyed the chicken tikka masala and the aloo gobi the best for their use of bold flavor and hearty chunks of meat/veggie. Other dishes such as the chicken keema, while nice that it was included in the buffet (You don't usually see this dish at Indian buffets), tasted slightly underseasoned. I appreciated that you are given the choice of 3 different naans for your table (We chose garlic). 

The interior is quite lovely. You can tell a lot of time was placed into making the interior a welcoming, inviting space.

Service was good and the host was doing double duty as waiter. Despite his dual roles he was able to check up on us and refill drinks as needed with a friendly demeanor.

Dessert included kheer (Rice pudding) and gulab jamun. I liked how the kheer was more light, refreshing, and not overly sweet.

It's an automatic fail when I come for breakfast and am there for at least 30 minutes and not once during that time did anyone come around to offer a coffee refill.  Not once.  

Longer review:

I saw Biscuits Cafe on Yelp and since it's close to home I decided I'd have to give it a go.  I wouldn't have ordered the biscuits and gravy combo but when in Rome... This is their signature, their biscuits.  The combo includes a choice of meat, I chose sausage, and two eggs any style.  I opted for over easy.

The order was done quickly.  I am not a connoisseur of biscuits and gravy.  In fact, I can't remember the last time I ordered this.  The biscuit was OK.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to be house made but I'm pretty sure it wasn't.  There was nothing special about it.  The gravy was OK, too, with a hint of ground pepper.  I'm certainly glad I didn't order the breakfast with two biscuits.  The sausage was two links that were sliced horizontally and grilled.  The eggs were done over easy.

All in all, breakfast was OK.  I should have stuck with an omelette or Benedict--my usual go to breakfast dishes.  But, I'll never know what they're like because I won't be back.  

When I paid at the register, the woman asked for my member number.  When I told her I didn't have one, she asked me if I wanted to join their club.  My answer was a polite no.

People, when you have three servers covering about 7 tables, it's not hard to bring a carafe of coffee around and offer warm ups or refills.  It should be something you dream about at night.  If one of your two specialties is breakfast and you fail on service for that, there's not much hope for you.",17,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Yesterday I came back to the Mandarin Oriental to have breakfast in the MOzen Bistro on the 3rd floor.  Again, all staff were extremely pleasant and helpful.  I also went up to the Sky Lobby to get that wonderful view of this section of the Las Vegas Strip and part of CityCenter.

You can choose between a two patty burger (The regular size), or the ""little"" one patty size. Fries can either be plain or tasty Cajun style. 

I went with a ""little"" bacon cheeseburger. Don't let the moniker fool you- there is nothing little about this burger! It was a sizable portion of beef, with fresh, tasty ingredients. We also split a medium size order of Cajun fries.

I went with ""all the way"" minus mayo, and added jalapeno. ""All the way"" means basic ingredients you would typically find in your burger, outlined in black on the menu board. Such ingredients include mustard, ketchup, lettuce, pickles, tomato, grilled onion, grilled mushroom, and mayo. The more non-traditional toppings are outlined in red on the menu board, and include jalapeno, relish, and A1 sauce. 

Service was fast and friendly, and my burger and fries were made in no time.

The burger was nicely grilled, and the veggies were fresh and crisp. Even the jalapeno was fresh and thinly sliced. It packed a punch! The bacon was the equivalent of 1 strip on the burger, which was cooked nice and crisp. The grilled onions were a nice addition, but if you order them on your burger don't expect a lot of caramelized flavor on them since they'll taste a little more steamed than grilled.

The fries were delicious. The Cajun spice mix dusting them were a good addition. The medium size is a good size if you are sharing with someone.

The drink fountain is the cool ""create your own"" soda machine, with a multitude in diet and regular options. Orange flavored mello yello? Lime ginger ale? Vanilla diet barqs? Yes please!

I like the selection of stores and restaurants, there's a theater here, and a plethora of parking spots.  What I'm not a fan of is that it's so spread out here that sometimes to get to one store from another, you have to get in your car and drive there rather than just walking.  Part of the reason why is because some of the stores are on a very large scale, like PetSmart or Target.  

Once you find parking, it can be a headache to get out of here in high traffic times.  Also, like many people have said before in previous reviews, even with those misters outside, it can be still quite unpleasant walking outside to go shopping when it's scorching hot in the summer.",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

If you had told me before we left that my wife would eat foie gras or veal cheeks, I would have laughed in your face.  Now I can't say that.  She did eat that and she liked it!

Let's start at the beginning.  We had an early reservation at 5 PM and as soon as they opened, the hostess came and got us as we people watched at the Cosmo.  We were seated in the area a few steps up from the main floor.  Our server was Donny and he was top notch!

He talked us through some possibilities after we studied the menu for awhile.  First, we ordered white asparagus with Idiazabal cheese.  The cheese was shredded so finely and had such a good flavor that it was a beautiful topping for the asparagus.  

Next we each had soup--me gazpacho and my wife the Black garlic soup.  Both were very good!  

This was followed by Ground pork and foie gras cannelloni and boneless chicken wings.  By now, my wife was getting into the tapas idea and the sharing part and we each enjoyed the dishes.  The Béchamel sauce on the cannelloni was a superb addition to the delicate cannelloni that were filled with very good ground pork and foie gras--and yes, she ate the foie gras and liked it!

One last main dish to share was the veal cheeks with morels.  It was excellent and the veal was fork tender.

On to dessert--I ordered the Chocolate hazelnut cake with praline ice cream and my wife ordered the rice pudding with vanilla and cinnamon with a lemon sorbet.  The cake was rich, dark chocolate and decadent--just the way I like my chocolate!  The rice pudding was very good.  My wife thought the sorbet was too sour but I disagreed thinking it was a great counterpoint to the mild sweetness of the pudding.

Service was excellent throughout the dinner.  Bus people did their jobs efficiently, more iced tea was brought, Donny came around to suggest we might want to order our hot foods so the flow of the meal would not be interrupted and he had recommendations for us when we asked and he was spot on with them!

I'll be returning.  Next I want to try the lobster paella along with other dishes.",5,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

After all closed, I was waiting to see what would happen.  Then I heard that he had opened a new trattoria in the Lakes which is fairly close to where I live.

I made a reservation and entered just before the reserved time at 5:15.  I was shown to a two top table around the wall from the entrance with a view of part of the restaurant.  In a short time, the waiter brought water, took my order for iced tea, and while this was going on, Chef Marc came to the table to greet me and to talk about the new place and then the specials for the night and he was talking up some of the dishes on the menu.

I ended up ordering the charred octopus to start.  It's served with white beans, celery, and lemon juice.  The octopus was nicely charred and the pieces were very plump and juicy.  In order to try both a pasta and a main course, my server, Donny, suggested the kitchen would make me a smaller portion of pasta.  I decided to get the small portion of wild mushroom ravioli with a truffle butter and parmesan cheese sauce.  The server added extra grated cheese.  The parmesan cream sauce was a perfect compliment to the ravioli and the smaller order was a generous portion but not enough to fill one up for the main course.

For the main, I ordered Scottish Salmon which was one of the two fish of the day selections.  The salmon had a coating of red and black pepper for a spicy taste and it was cooked perfectly.  Accompanying the salmon was a small amount of mashed potatoes and some glazed carrots.  I didn't think anyone served glazed carrots anymore but there they were.  While I would rather have had something else, they were OK and they gave a good counterpoint to the salmon's spicy topping.

For dessert, I got Italian style cheesecake and a double espresso.  Both were a good finish to a pleasant meal.

Service was excellent.  The staff was on everything immediately.  My only problem was with the sound.  The evening started with few customers and you could hear Sinatra singing.  Later, as more people came, the place got very loud from peoples' talk.  It just reverberated around the relatively small place.  I was glad they didn't turn up the music to try to make up for the loud talking.",18,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Friday night, I had a ticket for the play ""The Mineola Twins"" at the Art Square Theatre in the heart of the downtown Arts District and thus I was thrust into the First Friday action.

I didn't go as early as I could have to get a good parking spot and I opted not to take one of the shuttles.  I scouted a couple of side streets and ended up parking at Gass and 3rd which gave me only a 6 block walk.

From the moment I got the vibe of the crowd, I knew I was hooked on First Friday.  It was enjoyable seeing the street performers, looking at some of the art (wow, some of it looks like something one of my 6th grade students did years ago), and smelling the most incense I've smelled since I was in grad school.  It was also a fun diversion to see Metro cuffing a guy on the hood of one of their cruisers.

I was on a mission to find an ice cream truck but alas there was none to be found.  I ended up getting a deep fried Twinkie from one of the vendors.  No need to go inside the Mermaids Casino on Fremont Street now.  It was surprisingly good, but it's not something I'd buy on a regular basis.

This was a really different place to come.  Evidently, I got there after the breakfast crowd had gone and before the lunch people came.  It was quite OK.

A gentleman greeted me at the door and said to sit wherever I wanted.  He brought a menu and said the server would be right there.  After a few minutes, she hadn't come out of the kitchen yet.  He asked me what I'd like to have and I asked him what the frittata of the day was.  He said, ""I can make you anything you want.""  He then gave me several options and I chose the frittata with sun dried tomatoes and feta cheese.

He had brought me coffee already and the server appeared from what she was doing while he went to the kitchen to work his magic.  The frittata was soon delivered along with the rye toast I requested.  The toast had some house made ""jam"" that they made from fresh fruits.  The fruits were cooked down until there was some thickness and then sweetened the server explained to me.  It was more of a dipping sauce than a spread but it was very good!

An absolute delight and blend of flavors.

The 5 spice beef soup consists of brisket, beef broth, choy sum, udon noodle, cilantro, chili, and lime.  The 5 spice was a wonderful flavoring to the beef broth.  The chefs put the soup bowls in hot water before filling them with broth or noodles.

Service tonight was as good as it always is.  My server was Gerardo and once again, I did not have to ask for an iced tea refill.  My glass was refilled automatically.  Another thing of merit is that they coursed my meal unlike many Asian restaurants.  They waited until my shrimp toast was done and I had a few minutes to just sit.  Then my soup was prepared and served.  That really is a plus.

I enjoy sitting at the bar as I dine solo.  I can watch the cooks do their thing right on the other side and have a show with my meal.

One at the drive through register, one at the counter register and one making drinks.  The 4th person just stood around watching but I never saw her make a drink during the 5 minutes I waited.

Wouldn't it make sense to task her with the cold drinks--frappuccinos and such--and the other one could concentrate on the drinks that needed to be made at the espresso machine.

Oftentimes they will be cover/tribute bands, or bands/acts that were popular decades back. We went here to see Queen Nation, which was probably the closest you'll get to seeing a live Queen concert done well. The singers were awesome and the lead singer really sounded and had the moves like Freddie Mercury. We were initially seated in the front row, and we thought, oh nice! But then, we realized we were sitting right in front of the huge speakers/amplifiers! This had two implications. 1. Our ears might potentially bleed from the decibels generated by the speaker system (I've had the displeasure of sitting right in front of a speaker system at a concert, something I never want to do again!) 2. We can't see much because the speakers are blocking our view of most of the stage. Luckily, the seating here isn't reserved (Despite having seat numbers on your ticket), so after explaining our situation to the check in attendant, she was gracious enough to move us to another location, apologizing for the initial seating arrangement.

The show was packed, so service was a bit spotty, which was fine with us since we didn't really need anything to drink. They offer your standard alcoholic beverages, as well as a few specialty cocktails on their drink menu.

The membership also allows you to use either the Chandler location or the Scottsdale location.  We normally go to the Chandler spa to get massages and facials, but we decided to try out the Scottsdale spa for a change!

The spa is nestled in the NE corner of Frank Lloyd Wright and Via Linda, in the Walgreens shopping plaza.  In design and layout, it's similar to the Chandler spa.  There are some minor differences though.  Instead of the nice waterfront view in Chandler's relaxation lounge, there is a TV that shows some Hawaiian scenes.  There is just one shower in the Scottsdale location, and it is a bit smaller, although they are planning on adding another shower in the future.  

I tried the 90 minute Waikiki massage, a combination of more traditional therapeutic massage and lomi-lomi.  Steve, as usual, did a great job at handling those tough knots and tension spots that are omnipresent in my back, shoulders, and neck.  The lomi-lomi portion of the massage is definitely a full-body massage, and almost every major muscle gets massaged, including the abdominals.  The coconut oil they use for the massage smells great and leaves your skin super soft and hydrated.  

Another perk for your birthday week is that you can pick out an item from their store at 50% off, a great deal for their high quality products.  I picked up the strawberry exfoliant powder which is the same exfoliating agent they use in the native facial.  I used it today and my skin feels great!

I started with the lobster corn dogs which were accompanied by a container of crème fraîche flavored with whole grained mustard.  I have never had a regular corn dog--ever-- so this was a treat in more ways than one.  The lobster was very flavorful, the coating was a nice soft texture, and the mustard sauce made the combination a winner.

Next I got the peanut butter crunch burger.  It's a large burger, I'm figuring 8 ounces before cooking, served on a bed of fries.  The burger is topped with peanut butter and some bacon jam.  There are also a number of ribbed potato chips on top and it gives a nice crunchiness to the burger.  I asked for it rare and that's the way I got it.  The fries were crispy but there were way too many.

For dessert, I tried one of their cakes 'n shakes pairings.  I got the roasted peach and almond buckle that comes with a salted caramel shake and a small container of bourbon toffee to pour into the buckle like you would flavoring into a soufflé.  It was very good but the salted caramel shake which was very thick needed more salt.  I didn't taste any salt at all.

Service was excellent for most part.  It took quite awhile to get my check because it seemed like everyone was getting ready to leave at the same time.  Until then everything was good.  I was brought a new iced tea before my other one was finished, there was a clean fork brought between the corn dogs and the burger--in short--the kind of attention you get from higher end restaurants and not generally associated with a gastropubs.

Fy4t2XHIRKwMk_ocCZze0Q,0,2012-03-05,1,EMYH51XNqeReqVPZUzgwig,3,"Review for Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu:

I went to Envy tonight for the last night of Restaurant Week for this spring.  The choices were limited which is to be expected for a RW menu.  The bread basket was quite nice with slices of French bread, white chocolate walnut bread, and some breadsticks. 

Course 1:  I opted for the Butternut Squash Soup with brown sugar croutons.  This was excellent!  When I took some soup with a crouton, I had both a somewhat sweet taste mixed with the flavor of the squash.  Truly inspired thinking on the part of the chef to come up with this combination.

Before Course 2, my server, Joshua, brought me a small triple dish that had sea salts from different parts of the world.  The white was from Australia, the black from Hawaii, and the pink was Murray River salt.  He urged me to try the salt but to use care because it can be overdone.  It was fun trying the different flavors with pieces of steak.  Australian was my favorite.

Course 2:  Of course I chose the filet mignon.  Why get salmon at a steak house?  The steak was anchored on some very thin slices of sweet potato.  The steak was cooked correctly.  I ordered it black and blue and it almost was.  Done a bit more than I like because it wasn't blue enough.

Course 3:  There was no choice here but who needed one?  RW dessert is triple chocolate lava cake.  It was outstanding.  The chocolate was rich.  It was also bittersweet chocolate which was a good choice to keep the overall sweetness in check.  There was a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Great end to the meal.

A couple of things prevent me from giving a higher rating.  I'm not sure if the bread was warmed in a microwave but it seemed that way.  When I decided to have a second slice of that wonderful white chocolate walnut, it had dried quickly and had a bit of a crust on it.  This doesn't happen with fresh bread unless it's microwaved for heating.  As mentioned before, the steak was a little too done for me.  Finally, as another reviewer noted, you have to take into account the beautiful surroundings, the good service, and the portion size vis à vis the price and Envy comes up a bit short.  I realize this is an RW menu, but when comparing it to other places I went during Restaurant Week, Envy couldn't compare with some of the others.

The service was excellent.    Joshua, was very knowledgable and helpful.  Props to Chef Michael for stopping by the table to chat with me and ask for feedback about the meal.  

This was a good experience, but I'm not sure if I'd return.  I checked the regular menu and I'm sure my wife would be happier where her choices were more numerous.",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We were asked if we wanted to eat on the patio or inside.  Because the water flow at the fountain is loud, we asked for a patio seat near the back.  That's exactly what we got from the delightful hostess.

Within moments, our server was there to take our drink order and a runner stopped with fresh bread and a bottle of olive oil with a sprig of rosemary.  She poured some of the oil into a small dish for dipping the bread.  Our iced teas were quickly brought.  We had a few questions and our server, Cheyanne, was an excellent help.

My wife ordered the chicken Limone which the menu describes as ""fettuccine with grilled chicken, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes and lemon zest tossed in a tangy cream sauce.""  I got the pollo la Griglia which is described as ""grilled chicken medallions with oven-roasted tomatoes, artichoke hearts and provolone cheese in a tomato caper bianco sauce, served with risotto cake and asparagus.""  For dessert, we shared a Coppa Cioccolata which is described as ""chocolate gelato and fresh raspberries with chocolate & raspberry sauces.""

The food was excellent.  The cream sauce with my wife's chicken was very good, and she loved the touch of the sun-dried tomatoes in the sauce.  The chicken was moist and tender.  My chicken was also very good.  The provolone was quite stringy and made the dish very tasty!  The risotto cakes were something new for me and I'm so glad I got them.  I think I'll return and just get some risotto cakes they were that good.

Dessert was also excellent!  The gelato was dark chocolate and had a very rich flavor.  The fresh raspberries and the sauces just added to a good dessert and a perfect size for sharing.

The ambiance was outstanding!  Watching the ceiling lights change brightness and color to emulate sunrises and sunsets and seeing the small blue lights for stars while listening to the water at the fountain makes for a romantic and scenic setting.  It's so much fun to dine at a place like this in Las Vegas where we can watch the tourists as they stroll by and take photos of everything.  What a city!

As for service, it was first rate!  Our table was never unattended by someone.  When I put and empty packet of Sweet 'n Low on the table, it was removed almost immediately.  Cheyanne or one of the bussers kept our iced teas refilled.  She was a very pleasant young woman.  She boxed some leftovers and included a packet with plastic ware and a napkin.  

I had promised Brandon, the general manager, at our Yelp event that I'd be back.  When I asked about him last night, Cheyanne gave him my message and he came to the table and chatted with us.  I also watched as he went to other tables to check on diners.  He's alert to what's going on and he's a very personable guy.  The staff and the food make this place a will return.

28 day aged wagyu carpaccio
Smoked foie rinds
Drake duck jam
Kurobuta pulled pork
Octo-cargot
Scallop dynamite
Shumai
Yari ika squid
Squid ink and uni fried rice
Whole crispy fried fish
Green tea and uni dessert

Inyo is doing some fine food.  Over the approximately three hours we dined, we got to sample items from the menu.  I was going to go here myself but I was cautioned against this.  I was advised it was best to go with several people to sample more items and that was very sound advice.  There were some real winners in the 12 courses.

The smoked foie rinds--crispy togarashi rinds with yuzu honey and shaved smoked foie gras was completely addictive.  There was some Asian spice sprinkled on for a little heat.  I would never sit around the house eating pork rinds, but if these were here, I would.  Moving on, the beef carpaccio was quite good and the presentation was very good.  The think slices were topped with stilton bleu cheese and honey soy mustard seed along with micro greens.  The mustard seed and bleu cheese were touches that added beautifully to the dish.  Another winner was the drake duck jam served with rice crackers, bean sprouts, and basil.  The duck jam was thick and delicious.  I could have eaten the jam directly from the jar and skipped making a small cracker sandwich.

Continuing with the winners were the scallop ""dynamite""--live scallop, spinach and mushroom baked in a house masago sauce.  The only thing needed here was a spoon or some bread to finish off the wonderful masago sauce. Finishing off, the crispy whole fish and the whole squid were excellent.

I was not impressed with the octo-cargot.  The classic escargot topping was flavorful but the octopus was tough from being baked too long in the escargot dish.  There were some good flavors with the squid ink and uni fried rice but it would be a dish I wouldn't order.

Summing up, the 12 courses were mostly excellent dishes with creative food, plating that was nicely done, and service that was very good.  Inyo is a winner!",24,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I headed to Spring Mountain Road to do some exploring.  As I came alongside the Pacific Asian Plaza, I remembered a friend saying there was a great Malaysian restaurant there.  There was Penang on the second floor.

I got an order of Curry Puffs for an appetizer.  I wondered what was taking so long. The puffs are 4 good-sized pastries filled with a very good ground potato, chicken, tofu mixture with a curry seasoning.  They were very hot from the oven - hence the wait.  They were excellent.

For the main course, I got the Homemade tofu with scallops and lobster sauce.  There were no scallops, but there was a good amount of shrimp.  The tofu was absolutely sensational!!  

I decided to give the Malaysian iced coffee a try and it was good.  Not something I'd get every time, but it certainly was worth a try.

I'm glad I stopped here.  I have enough leftovers for dinner tonight.  The portions are so large, there is enough for two to share if you want.  Service was excellent.  And note, this is another Chinatown restaurant that does CASH ONLY.",1,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The Thai iced tea I had was lightly sweet and refreshing and the boba was soft and chewy. The selections for bubble tea are quite extensive, and most look like they are made with a powder for the flavoring. They have all your standard selections of donuts. 

I got a plain cake and blueberry donut. The donuts were very fresh tasting, with a lovely crisp outer crunch and soft, slightly dense and chewy center. 

The total price for the bubble tea (16 oz.) and two donuts was a little less than $5.

The menu has all your soulful favorites such as fried catfish, chicken, ribs, with delicious sides like Mac and cheese, collard greens, and cole slaw. Everything is made fresh from scratch, served with a friendly smile. 

I had the fish and chicken combo ($10.99), which includes your choice of tilapia or catfish,  and any piece of chicken. I chose the catfish with breast and was fully satisfied. The catfish had a crunchy, crispy cornmeal crust with moist, tender, delectable catfish. The fried chicken was superbly seasoned and battered, with very tender meat. The combo includes 2 sides and a piece of cornbread. The collard greens were a warm embrace of tender, smoky, slightly sweet vegetables. The cole slaw was creamy, tangy, and tasted good (But not as good as those collard greens!). 

The only little hiccup was that one person received mac and cheese as a side instead of baked beans. Since he ended up finishing the entire plate, I don't think he seemed to mind though.  :) Also, the food is made on the spot, which means it might take a little bit to get it out to you. But don't worry, it's well worth any wait, because they are infusing your food with a special little bit of heart and soul :)

Crab fried rice
Crab curry with vermicelli noodles
Grilled pork skewers
Northern Thai spicy pork sausage
Duck curry
Pork and pineapple curry
Crispy pork hock
Fried pork belly
Chicken wings
Catfish curry
Larb moo- ground pork
Two honey toast - one which vanilla and one with chocolate ice cream
Shaved ice
Bread with pandan custard

Chada Street's emphasis is on Thai street food served in a small plates manner.  My favorites of the dishes we tried were the pork sausage, crab fried rice, duck curry, catfish curry, and larb.  All were flavorful and I would order any of them again.  The crab curry was very good but would have been better served with rice than vermicelli noodles.  They varied a little in spice level but I'd say medium spiciness for most people.  The honey toast was OK with my favorite topping being the vanilla ice cream.

The dishes I was not as impressed with were the pork belly--it needs to be crispier, the pork skewers were OK but nothing special, and I thought the pork hock was the biggest let down of the meal.  Except for the fatty outside section in one area, it just didn't do anything for me.

Service was a mixed bag.  On ordering the many dishes, it was asked that the dishes be coursed out and not brought all at once.  We were finishing the first dishes when some more were brought and almost immediately three more were brought out.  We reused them and they were taken back to the kitchen.  At first we had to ask for clean share plates.  Later in the meal, they changed them without asking and they provided some clean silverware.

The park is divided into two sections--the walkway section with a children's play area  and the ball fields area.  The Summerlin website lists the walkway park as 4.6 acres of play area and walking trails and the ball field section as a 12.7 acre park.  Both sections have sidewalks.

It makes it convenient to be able to go under Town Center Drive to get to/from the park.  The traffic is heavy at times, and this makes a nice shortcut.  For walking or biking, the sidewalks go around the large bowl of the ball fields both at the bottom level or along the top rim.  There's a set of stairs and a ramp to get to the top rim near the Willows Community Center and pool on the north side of the ball field area.

At least 1 star off for this awful customer interaction!  If I ever come back, if you don't call me bub, I won't call you Mikey.

Now for the good.  This was my first time at Bradley Ogden.  Nice first impression, no?  I ordered from the prix fixe Celine menu.  I had to ask for it and as Candace remarked in her review, this server made no attempt to talk about either menu nor to ask me if I had any questions.

I started with the Maytag Blue Cheese Soufflé.  It was delicious.  There was a cranberry relish and some small cubes of beets and one pice of candied walnut.  I love blue cheese and this was a great start.  For the main course, I got the Duroc Pork Loin that came over a bed of long beans, and a cute round pot with lid that was filled with cornbread pudding as the starch.  The pork had a light mustard vinaigrette scallion sauce.  There was one piece of fried pork. There were two large pieces of pork and it was juicy and cooked perfectly. For dessert, I got the Bananas Foster Cake with macerated bananas with the cake.  There was some sauce over the banana bread, shaped like pieces of muffin, and there was a side of cream cheese ice cream.

There was nothing about the food I didn't like.  The bus people and the woman who delivered the food from the kitchen and explained the dishes were quite competent.  It would have been a higher rating if it hadn't been for Mikey.  I get treated better at McDonalds.",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Unfortunately, it doesn't taste anything like jugo verde. It tasted like a salad threw up in a cup. There was a weird hint of sour flavor at the end of my sip and a strong flavor of celery. I think if you like V8 type juices this is your drink, but I could only take a sip and I was done. If this is their signature drink I'm not too sure I want to try other ones.

dTsyfvRfN-zFdsgIDuQllQ,8,2016-04-17,8,G2y8S3y4-dNsS-ez1kutsw,3,"Alder & Birch has replaced the Canal Street restaurant that I used to go to and liked a lot.  If you knew Canal Street, when you see A&B, you'll notice a big change.  Alder & Birch is bright and modern when compared with the darker, river themed wall of Canal Street.  I decided to give Alder & Birch a try.

I made a reservation and got there just about one minute before.  I was taken to a table that could seat three people with two of the seats being booth seating.  I sat in the chair.  I was given the menu and my server soon appeared.  Her name was Brandy and she was excellent!!

I ordered the tomato bisque soup, the signature, 14 ounce A&B porterhouse (ordered blue), fries for the side, and later strawberry shortcake for dessert.  

I was quickly brought my iced tea and some bread.  They had a nice selection of sliced bread, some lavash, and a focaccia square.  Along with the bread was a round dish with soft butter and another dish with large salt crystals for those, like me, who like salted butter.  The focaccia was hands down the best of the bread service.

The tomato bisque soup was very good and served extremely hot which was good!  I took my time with the soup and enjoyed the focaccia.

Next came the porterhouse along with the blue cheese topping I ordered with an up-charge of $4.  The fries were placed on the table and it was explained that the ketchup was jalapeño flavored and if I wanted regular ketchup I just needed to ask.  Not being a ketchup fan, I tried two fries with it and I was unimpressed.  I didn't taste the jalapeño zing I expected and it was just ketchup.  I enjoyed the rest of the fries without dipping.  The steak was done the way I like and the Maytag blue cheese topping was very good.  There was one large pearl onion grilled and served with the steak.  The meat near the bone came right off.  If it wouldn't have been messy, I would have gnawed the little bit left and cleaned the bone.

Brandy brought the dessert menu.  Some of the desserts were somewhat standard so I went for the strawberry shortcake.  Brandy explained that it wasn't cake at all but white chocolate bread.  It didn't matter--i wanted to try something different and it was.  Their strawberry shortcake consists of two slices of Bon white chocolate bread, grilled, and served with strawberries and vanilla bean ice cream.  There was a partial rose petal done in thin chocolate accompanying the dish.  I've had Bon Breads white chocolate at home and either they have changed or the grilling changes the bread but there was little chocolate flavor to the bread.  There was a good grill flavor but the dessert is essentially grilled toast with strawberries and ice cream.  Good but just OK.

Some things about Alder & Birch.  I like the modern decor but the lighting could have been turned down some.  It's bright in there and there was no rheostat to darken the dining area and give it a more intimate atmosphere.  It was modern wood, glass, and light.  I don't want it dark so I need my iPhone to read the menu but I'd rather not have it the way it was.

My server, Brandy, was excellent!  She was always there to replace my iced tea, answer questions, or see if I needed anything.  The people working with her was just as good.

The dinner was good and A-OK as Yelp says for three stars.  I don't think it wowed me enough to bring me back especially the lighting.",19,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Today was the grand reopening of this location after months of being Field Kitchen. The menu is for the most part, the same as it was before the Field Kitchen conversion, but the interior still holds the swanky bistro feel. The dinnerware also has the same nice cups, plates, and bowls that Field Kitchen had. We went for lunch, where they had some staff outside entering people for a raffle for 52 free meals. They were very friendly and very eager to make sure this new, yet familiar experience would be good for all the customers.

Your old standard dishes are back, such as the tuna tarragon and the broccoli salad, although the wonton salad is now chicken-less (At least for this month). There seems to be slightly less of a selection of toppings for your salad, to be replaced be more dressing options (Including some unique ones like smokey bacon and mango basil). As a throwback to the previous Field Kitchen days, they do offer some a la carte skewers of rosemary chicken, and fresh mozzarella with tomato for a little over a dollar. Since they nixed the fresh fruit bar during the Field Kitchen experiment, they had to move the puddings, mousses, and fresh fruit into a smallish corner of the salad bar portion of the restaurant.

The drink station is pretty awesome. There's an automated soda machine with a touch screen that has a plethora of soda and water choices with various flavor additions if you so desire. They have an increased selection of diet sodas, such as diet Seagram's ginger ale (With various flavor additions like lime), and diet Barq's (There's an option for regular diet, or vanilla diet, very cool!). There's a nice selection of teas, including a very tasty mango ginger tea, as well as various regular and strawberry lemonades.

The soups seem to be the same quality and quantity. In addition to the standard chicken noodle soup, they had at least 2 different chilis, a tomato soup, and a rich and hearty posole with big chunks of pork in it, just to name a few. The bakery selection is limited on the muffin side, although they have the same pizzas and focaccias as they did before. When we went they only had brownies and blueberry muffins available. These muffins are huge compared to the usual sized Sweet Tomatoes muffins, about twice the size of the previous mini-muffins.

The pasta section was probably the most improved since the transition back to Sweet Tomatoes. The pasta was nicely cooked, and I was a big fan of the spicy marinara. It had lots of spicy kick, and a nice rich tomato flavor. The mac and cheese seems to have improved as well.

I didn't try any of the soft serve, but they still had the standard vanilla/chocolate combo, with the various toppings and sauces to go with it.

Service was cheerful and friendly as always. After we paid, we got a 15% off coupon to use for the whole month of April. Nice!

There are a lot of good options for restaurants in this area now, with the opening of Spokes, the reopening of Sweet Tomatoes, and the highly anticipated opening of Los Reyes De La Torta. I'm glad Sweet Tomatoes is back to its original concept, and will be dining here again with frequency!

It was crowded around 1ish when we were here, but there was plenty of seating outside, and it was a nice day, so we ate on the patio.

They have some good, reasonably priced lunch specials.  My husband had the pulled pork sandwich ($6.99) which included one side and a cornbread muffin.  I opted for the one-meat platter ($7.99) which also includes one side and cornbread.  For those that are really hungry, you can upgrade to a 2 meat platter for a dollar more.  

There are various platter meats to choose from, including pulled pork, brisket, chicken, and a beer-battered cod.  I opted for the cod, which had a very crispy, crunchy crust.  The cod, however, was just a step up from the Gorton's Fisherman.  It was a little tough and dry.  I tried the pulled pork sandwich, which had a hearty amount of meat on plain hamburger bun.  The meat itself was tender, and had a good amount of smokey flavor, but for me, there was a little bit of a weird aftertaste with the meat at the end.  

For sides, there are a multitude to choose from, including fries, mashed potatoes, baked beans, and green beans.  I tried the mashed potatoes, which had a strong garlic flavor, and had a light, whipped texture.

While Fashion Square is known for their luxury retailers, they also have stores for the more plebian folk. Examples include Gamestop, American Eagle and Charming Charlie. The Victoria's Secret here is one of the nicest I've ever been in!

We ventured in and were promptly seated. After poring through the menu, we decided on a combination of 1 lb. trifecta hot shrimp and 1 lb. of pulled pork with hot bbq sauce. The shrimp were just as good as the Mesa location, with quite a bit of heat to them at the ""hot"" level (Level 3 of 5 heat levels I believe). The pulled pork had a nice smoked flavor and the bbq sauce complimented it well. Although the shrimp and the pork were both ordered at the same spiciness level, the shrimp did taste spicier, and I ended up eating so much spicy food that my palate turned numb!

Service was prompt and the waitress was superb in quickly refilling our drinks, a very important service to provide when your mouth feel like its on fire from the spiciness of the food!

We were here about 4:15 yesterday afternoon and there were very few people there.  We were seated immediately and brought menus and drinks.  The chips and salsas were brought and our server explained that the warm salsa was spicy and the cold salsa was not spicy.  The chips and spicy salsa were good.  The chips are very thin and I found I broke several in half dipping them in the salsa.

For our dinners, I ordered the Tacos al Pastor.  Here's the description from their menu:  Spicy pork with pineapple, pico de gallo and cilantro.  My wife ordered the Tampico which is described as: Grilled chicken breast topped with sautéed artichoke hearts, mushrooms, spinach, red bell peppers with sour cream-poblano sauce and monterey jack cheese.

My tacos were just OK.  The biggest problem with them was there was only one taco.  When I get tacos like this at genuine Mexican places, they're always doubled so there's some body to help hold the filling.  With my tacos and the single shell, the pico was wet enough that it softened the taco and made it almost impossible to pick up to eat.  I did eat the first one that way but I was awash in juice.  The pork was OK, but the spice was a heavy coating on the pork.  It was spicy but other than that, there wasn't a whole lot to recommend the tacos.  I also thought of the al pastors I've gotten from street vendors on East Charleston for a fraction of the cost I paid.  Stupid me!  With my tacos came rice and black beans.  My wife liked her chicken and it was as described.  It's the kind of dish you might get at any Tex/Mex kind of restaurant.

Dessert was the star of the night.  I got the très leches cake and she got the Mexican brownie.  My cake was excellent.  Her brownie came with a bit of table side ta da!
The brownie was placed on a very hot cast iron dish safely in a recessed wooden holder.  Then the vanilla ice cream was put on top of the brownie.  LAst, the sauce was poured over the ice cream and when the sauce hit the hot dish, it bubbled and made a kind of extra buttery syrup that added to the flavor of the brownie and ice cream.  

Now to service:  Up until the time we got our meals, everything was going along fine.  Then our server disappeared.  She came back once and asked about the food and then was gone again.  10 minutes after we finished our dishes, she was nowhere to be found.  The host looked at us several times and it seemed as though he was going to get her at one point but that was not the case.  Finally she showed and we asked about a box and asked about dessert.  She said she'd get the dessert tray and be back.

Again she was just gone.  About 5 minutes later, another server stopped and asked if we wanted a box.  We told him we'd already asked for one and then he brought his tray down to show us the desserts. We made our choice with him.  A few minutes later, our server and this second person arrived with the desserts.  She stood by as he did the table ta da for the brownie.  Then she left again.  About 6 minutes later, she came back with the check and just put it down.  

When I finished dessert and we had some time to relax and talk, I got my credit card out and put it in the holder and within 10 seconds, she was there to pick it up.  Wow, Speedy Gonzales then but not at the needed times.  

I really like Tivoli Village and there are some other restaurants there that I have yet to try.  But, Cantina Laredo won't be one of them.  We have so many small places along East Charleston that there's no reason to ever go here again.",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The portabella grille, strangely enough, did not have much portabella in it. Instead it consisted mainly of roasted zucchini and red bell pepper. While the bread was very good, the actual ciabatta bread was so thick compared to the vegetable mixture that with each bite, I could taste mostly bread and little filling.

I've had the breakfast chimichanga and some breakfast burritos here. The breakfast chimichanga was amazing. It was nicely fried, with a hearty portion of ingredients, smothered in country gravy and cheese. Each bite had a great interplay of flavors and textures. The breakfast burritos are more one-note for me. Although they were a very sizable portion, they were more bland, and the salsa they came with tasted more like a spicy tomato sauce.

Service is very cheerful and friendly. Overall, I'd definitely like to try another breakfast chimichanga, or maybe some of their pulled pork dishes.",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
WN5ON423ZCOy3_4F6XYikA,0,2010-09-25,0,UCXnoDSfHr6zYWCG6rDklA,3,"Decent wings and pizza, slow service.  We tried some medium and teriyaki wings, and a Provence, France pizza.  The medium wing sauce was just right- not too spicy, not too sour, as buffalo wings can sometimes get too vinegary.  The wings themselves are more crunchy than fall-off-the-bone moist.  The teriyaki wing sauce was also pretty good- not too sweet, with just the right amount of sauce coating the wing.  The pizza was decent- very large portions with a good amount of toppings on a thin-crust base.  

Service was, as stated, pretty slow.  This was in part probably due to the bar being understaffed that night, but I had to personally go find the waitress who was at the bar to get my order in, since we had been waiting, and waiting, and waiting, for her to come to our table to take our order.",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Backyard Taco offers chicken and beef grilled ""al carbon"" AKA over coals right in the kitchen as your order. The smell of mesquite is quite distinctive and you can catch the aromatic smokiness right when you enter the restaurant.

There was a fairly steady line on a Saturday afternoon but it moved quickly and my meal was made quicker than I could fill up on the salsa bar. I had the carne asada papa loca and a chicken burrito. Both had smoky grilled flavor, with plentiful toppings. They were both hearty portions. While I like the uniqueness of being served smashed baked potatoes with meat, cheese, and vegetables, I liked the taste of the burrito more. 

The salsa bar has several salsas, pickled onions, limes, and a very puree'd, runny looking guacamole. I wasn't really a fan of the guacamole, but I did like the various options for topping your meal.

The parking lot is a bit small but I had no problem finding a spot. I can imagine though at busier times it might be a problem finding space.

There aren't many spots for dine in either, so if you are coming at a very busy time take out is probably the way to go.

What a great way to end Restaurant Week!  I had a reservation and asked to be seated on the patio (the Terrace, the occupancy sign says).  The sun was in my face for about 15 minutes before going before going behind Treasure Island.  It was a great evening to sit out and enjoy the outstanding Las Vegas weather.

I was seated a few seconds when my server, Casey, came and took my drink order.  My iced tea was delivered quickly.  A different server came to take my order.  There was no Restaurant Week menu sheet with my regular menu so she just told me some of the choices.  After making my choices, a runner came by with aluminum foil wrapped garlic bread with a dish of marinara on the side.  Super garlic bread and very good marinara!

Back to ordering.  For course one, I went with crispy fried calamari.  It came with a side of the same tasty marinara as the garlic bread.  The serving size was huge.  This would definitely be an appetizer to share with one or two other people.  I sent almost half of it back so as not to fill up on calamari but I could have finished the plate.  Lightly breaded and fried lightly, it was very good!

I chose the penne alla vodka for course two.  It was a good sized serving and it was very good.  I slowly ate the penne enjoying each bite and forcing myself to have more garlic bread.

For dessert, I opted for the raspberry cheesecake.  The cheesecake was lightly flavored with raspberry--just barely noticeable.  The top was crisp from lightly torching the top like you would a crème brûlée.  There were several black cherries on the plate that was a good accompaniment for the cheesecake.

Service was excellent.  Casey came by often and topped off my iced tea, dishes were removed promptly by bus people, and my check was taken for payment by someone who had not been at my table at all.  It was a case of everyone watching how all the guests were doing.",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

My first time at Stripsteak and it was excellent!  I usually don't order steak out as it is almost always overcooked for me.  Based on the good reviews on Yelp, Stripsteak became an addition to my Restaurant Week list of places to go.

Amuse bouche:  Three containers of seasoned fries - garlic herb, truffle, and bay-seasoned.  There were three containers for dipping the fries one mustard and bay seasoned, truffle aioli, and ketchup.  Pace yourself here.  All tables are served the amuse bouche in lieu of a bread basket.  Since I was alone, I could have totally pigged out on these tasty fries.  5/5

Course 1:  Duck spring rolls.  Duck confit with sweet and sour cherry drizzle.  The duck was excellent and what a great appetizer.  5/5

Course 2:  OK, so I decided to get a steak.  It was the Kansas City strip steak with small sides of creamed corn and mushrooms.  The steak had a grilled small red onion and a yellow tinkerbell pepper.  The pepper is very mild.  The steak was grilled exactly as I ordered - black and blue. 5/5

Course 3:  Beignets and vanilla creme brulee.  Perfect ending to the meal.  I forced myself - yeah right - to finish the beignets.  5/5

As mentioned in other reviews, when you get ready to leave, you're given a small bag of candy popcorn with the Stripsteak logo to take as a gift.  It will be a TV snack some night.

My server, Alexis, was always available and attentive.  When the two eating next to me left for a bathroom trip, she refolded their napkins while they were gone.  I noticed this attention to detail and good service throughout the night.  

I was quite pleased to see the number of families with young, well behaved children.  There was a concert with someone named Selena Gomez at the Mandalay Events Center and thus the large number of children. Alexis had to explain to me who this Selena was.

A great evening and another wonderful Restaurant Week experience!",1,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
aM4pb4teV2Tr0Z-ZRt4icg,35,2016-05-24,27,YT-2u4IgGeL8fYfUsY9ygQ,4,"Some consider a six-pack as a collection of beer. Others may think of sculpted washboard abs. I prefer to think of a half dozen macarons. :)

Macarons, gelato, coffee, and chocolates? Awesome! After hearing all the good things about this little macaron shop I decided to stop by and indulge in some French sweets. The interior is pretty much the essence of ""girliness"" with bright pink accents and Paris themed decor. 

Le Macaron is a franchise with most locations in Florida. The Scottsdale Quarter store is the only one in Arizona. I stepped in and browsed through the mouthwatering cases of chocolates and macarons. I decided on a 6 pack of macarons and a single chocolate for a small taste of dessert.

The chocolate case held beautifully decorated, jewel-like sweets. Most of them had a glossy shiny sheen that added to their brilliance. The mango key lime chocolate I had ($2.20 for one) was a good balance of tart and sweet filling. The chocolate shell was good, but the viscosity was a little off for me in contrast with the soft gooey filling. My own personal preference would be to have the chocolate either a little softer so it melts in the mouth with the filling or a crisper shell to provide textural difference.

They had a wide array of macaron flavors with a few unique floral/herbal themed selections such as rose, basil, and lavender. My six pack consisted of gingerbread, white chocolate mint, dark chocolate passion fruit, black currant, orange chocolate Gran Marnier, and Sicilian Pistachio. Most of the macarons had a perfect texture with a lightly crisp exterior and very slightly chewy soft center for contrast. My passion fruit dark chocolate was either very slightly overcooked or an older batch and thus more evenly crunchy though. For the most part I enjoyed the flavors. Note that the white chocolate mint is made from spearmint flavor rather than peppermint (Not a fan of spearmint). I also thought the gingerbread had an odd slightly soapy aftertaste to it. My favorites of the bunch were the pistachio, orange chocolate Gran Marnier, and black currant. 

Service was very friendly and the woman at the counter packaged my macaron bounty very well. 

My total for 6 macarons and 1 chocolate was a little less than $20. A little pricey, but hey it's Scottsdale. When I walked out I noticed the sign for affogato which I will definitely have to try next time!",36,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,3,2013-08-27,1,VptU-iSEayydcc-57XBZKA,5,"I had an appointment this morning and decided to go somewhere for breakfast after.  A bit of searching on Yelp helped me decide to go with the Gold Spike Grill.  I've been reading about the changes here since it was purchased by the Downtown Project.  Wow, what a nice place!  What a nice surprise!!

The place is small so I didn't have to search to find the Grill.  It's a bright, almost all white area on the east side of the building.  I opted to sit at the counter.  As I walked through the lobby area, I noticed all the people with their laptops and I soon checked my iPhone for wifi.  Free, fast wifi!  Yes!

The menu isn't very large for breakfast but it's certainly adequate.  As I was looking at the menu, my server, Brittany, brought me coffee and a glass of ice water.  I ordered their 3 egg omelette with any three ingredients you choose from their list.  I got spinach, jalapeño, and cheese.  The omelette comes with hash browns and toast of your choice.  As I was enjoying the wifi and taking photos of the Grill, I noticed the hot sauces that were on the counter.  They have a whole bunch of kinds most of which I've never heard of before.  

When my omelette arrived, I chose to put some ""Scorned Woman"" hot sauce on part of it.  The bottle had a heat level of 8 on it.  I don't know who judges the heat of a hot sauce, but 8 was a bit too high.  But, it was hot and it was a good addition to the omelette.

Service was good and sitting at the counter, one of the cooks looked out after I was eating for awhile and asked how breakfast was.  When I gave him thumbs up, he had a big smile and went back to his work!  This was something I noted from everyone at the Gold Spike.  People had smiles, they were very pleasant, and they were welcoming!

When I left, I spent some time in the ""back yard"" which would be a great place to bring a drink or sit and spend some time chatting with friends.  There's also an area behind a fence where you can eat outdoors.

Parking is very convenient and free.  Enter from 4th Street between Ogden and Stewart as you head north on 4th.

While the breakfast was nothing exotic, it gets all 5 stars.  This is as good as breakfast gets and the staff is so very pleasant.  Throw in the wifi and you have a great spot!",8,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Since my friend and I were neophytes, one of the staff members showed us the right way to hold, helped load the guns, and helped us with aiming.  While I did OK with the handgun, I wouldn't recommend the large rifle if you are a shorter person like me, since it was very hard to aim through the sight and my friend who is a few inches taller than me, but still petite, had the same problem, but also did OK with the handgun.

The dining room is small in width but runs the length of the building.  There's a nice wooden wall with some fireplaces that block the dinging room from the bar section and makes a great spot for our book club meetings.

I started with the Caesar salad.  Good dressing with nice croutons.  There was a lot of salad.  It wasn't a starter salad but rather like a dinner salad without meat.

For my main course, I ordered the chicken scaloppine.  While the menu says it's a chicken breast with artichoke, mushrooms, and prosciutto there was no artichoke.  The breast was very lightly breaded and fried and served with seasonal vegetables and risotto.  The dish was very good.  The artichoke would have added some to it, but it stood the way it was very well.

For dessert, how could I resist the deep fried Oreos with ice cream?  Four battered and deep fried Oreos and a martini glass of ice cream.  It was very good, but the Oreos lose something in the deep frying.  The creamy inside got lost with the fried crust of the batter.  If someone should offer me this again, I wouldn't turn them down.

My server was named Princess.  She was very good.  Great personality and good service.  She kept my iced tea filled all during my meal.

Salad bar, meat meat meat meat meat meat meat meat.  Stomach full, gut busted.

The salad bar consists of shrimp cocktail, assorted salad items such as hearts of palm, marinated artichoke and mushroom, mussels, and a giant pot of feijoada.  The bread that is served at your table is unique and delicious- little discs of chewy cheesy bread served warm at your table.  They also give you a selection of condiments and sides at your table- farofa (toasted, ground grain), marinated chopped onions, fried yucca and banana croquettes.  

The concept itself makes it kind of like the Brazilian version of dim sum.  People coming around with food items that you get to choose from for your meal.  The meat itself, pretty tender and juicy.  We tried 8 out of the 12-14 meats that are available (sausage, chicken, ribs, various cuts of beef, etc.), and found that the beef items were the best tasting out of the selections we were presented.

The price?  $35 all you can eat including salad bar.  The wait?  We had reservations here on a Saturday night and we had to wait ~20 minutes or so for our table to be ready.  They were packed that night!",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Since the place opened, I've been intrigued by the idea of lobster ice cream so I had to give it a try.  There is one serving size, a dish with vanilla ice cream with mixed in lobster pieces and a larger frozen piece of lobster as a topper.

The ice cream was not very creamy.  It had a crumbly texture.  The lobster flavor was not evident until it warmed a bit--they opened a new 5 gallon container--so it was quite frozen.  Now and then, you get a piece of lobster that has a salty taste.  

In the end, I rate this as just OK.  It's certainly worth a try once.  The prices here are high with the lobster ice cream being just under $10 including tax.  That's a lot of froyo at other places around town.  Considering that the cheapest lobster sandwich is $17, this is the least expensive lobster treat at this place.

There are some round tables and I was able to people watch--one of my favorite hobbies on a Saturday night in Las Vegas.  The number of people buying their frozen yard and 1/2 yard drinks was funny.

I was super hungry and a bit brain dead so I appreciated that there are pre-set options for poke bowls for those that don't feel like making a custom bowl. I went with the Aloha Classic, 3 scoops with spring salad. The classic comes with ahi tuna, onion, green onion, sesame seeds, red pepper flake, and classic Hawaiian shoyu. Not a bad combo at all! It was made in a speedy amount of time and I did add a few extra toppings (Cucumber kimchi, nori seaweed). 

I enjoyed the bowl for the most part. The greens and fish were fresh and the toppings plentiful. The flavors all complimented each other well. The bowl was overdressed though, drenched in sauce so on some bites of salad all I could taste was the salty shoyu and nothing else. Eating 3 scoops of poke plus the salad base didn't quite fill my stomach up for lunch though so I had to scrounge for some more stuff to snack on afterwards. 

Service was friendly and quick. I'll be back for more poke bites but I will ask for a lighter amount of sauce next time. Since we have no beaches here in AZ to surf any waves I will settle for riding poke waves!",36,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg,12,2016-07-16,9,WS7S6sSLzzN2i1Lk7ms4dw,3,"This new Indian restaurant is only about four miles from home.  With the increase in people from India living in Las Vegas, a number of new Indian restaurants have opened near my neighborhood so that I don't have to go to the university area to enjoy Indian cuisine.  I came here today for the lunch buffet.  At $9.99, it's a good deal.

I was seated promptly in a mostly empty restaurant and brought water and the mango lassi I ordered.  I then went up to make my first choices.  The silverware is at the area where you pick up your plate so I got that, took it back to the table, and then went to look at the food.  

A cursory look showed me that most of the dishes were vegetarian and so that's what I chose for my first plate.  Outstanding things for the first plate were the chana masala, palak paneer, and dal tadka. The chana masala and palak paneer had a nice spiciness to them, and I am a big fan of dal in almost all forms.  I went to the end of the buffet for naan.  I was disappointed in it because it was somewhat rubbery from sitting in the warming tray and the first piece had no butter taste to it at all.  In addition, the end of this particular piece was thick like a slice of pizza.  It made it impossible to rip off a piece to grab some dal.  Instead I had to use my fork.

For the second plate, I got some goat biryani, chicken korma, and onion fritters.  The goat was so so.  Nothing I'd get again.  The chicken korma had a good flavor but again trying to get a piece of naan to wrap around one of the chicken pieces was next to impossible.  The onion fritters were more like dipped onion rings in thick bread batter rather than what one normally thinks of when you see the word fritter.

For dessert I tried two things--bread pudding and rice flour halvah.  They were both interesting and something new.  The bread pudding was more moist and soft than what one normally thinks of bread pudding.  The better of the two was the halvah which was quite good and different from anything I've had before.  I did look for gulab jamun but there were none.  I didn't want a cupcake so this ended the lunch on a sweet note.

The deal breaker for me is the naan.  I have been to no lunch buffet in the area where the naan is left cut in a heating pan to keep warm.  Naan should be fresh and brought out when it's ready.  The buffet consisted mainly of vegetarian dishes which is OK.  There were 3 meat dishes--chicken korma, goat biryani, and tandoori chicken.  

I will try this place for an evening meal but I'll go elsewhere for a lunch buffet.

NOTE:  I got a communication from the chef/owner of Paradise India this evening explaining that some staff didn't show up for work today and that is why he put the naan on the buffet.  It is never his way of doing things as he was host and cook today.  This explains a lot and it gives me faith that my next visit will be more enjoyable!",18,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I opted to go here to use a Groupon and because its location in the Miracle Mile Shops makes it an easy walk from the garage elevators to the restaurant for my wife.

I ordered two burgers--a mushroom and Swiss and a Western.  The mushroom and Swiss was supposed to be medium and the Western was to be rare.  With them, I ordered the soda/fries combo.  All that for a mere $36 including the $20 Groupon.

I went to the self serve area and got three flavors of ketchup.  I tried the balsamic ketchup, the maple bacon ketchup, and the fry sauce.  I also got our two iced teas and napkins.

The orders were brought and the mushroom Swiss was correct by burger was the wrong one so she took it back and eventually brought out a Western.  That's when my disappointment set it.  The burgers were larger and flatter than a hockey puck, but they were really lacking much flavor from the toppings.  They were also very, very dry.  I am a person who very rarely uses ketchup. I think it's a bastard food item meant to hide the taste of things on which it's spread.   When I put some on a burger, you know it's awfully dry and it needs something to make it taste better.  No luck.  It wasn't so dry, but the taste, oh it never was there.  The bacon on my Western was odd.  It was very tough although it had been cooked throughly.

There were a few things that made the experience tolerable.  I liked the women in their short shorts.  They looked quite fine.  The free wifi (well, I guess with the prices you should never refer to it as free wifi) worked well and was zippy.  Ask someone who works there for the password.  The wait for the burger was not long.  How did they overcook the meat that quickly to the point of desert dryness?  It's a puzzlement!  One more thing, the fries were good.

They do have sushi here but it is very limited and contains all cooked forms of sushi (e.g., shrimp nigiri) but no raw, which is probably better that way if they do not get a lot of people frequenting the sushi bar.  Desserts include various fruit, jello, some strudel-looking cake pieces, cookies, cream puffs, and ice cream.

Now on the the hot pot!  The broth here is so good.  There are a lot of veggies and Chinese herbs that flavor the broth, making it a whole lot more flavorful than the same type of broth at Mekong Palace.  The price is for all you can eat, and there is a wide selection of meats and vegetables to choose from.  Selections include thinly sliced beef, squid, chicken organ meats (liver, hearts), blue crab, tofu, lotus root, crawfish, taro, bok choy, various noodles, and daikon.

The standard broth they will bring out is a 2 sectioned pot that is filled with half of the original style chicken stock with pork, and a spicy broth (as spicy to your liking) on the other side.  There is a dipping station too which includes all the types of condiments that my mother uses when she makes hot pot (egg, satay, soy sauce, green onion, ginger, garlic, sesame sauce).

The price?  $19.99 for all you can eat, $.99 for soft drinks and iced tea.  Service was very attentive.  I'll definitely come here again for hot pot, but probably not so much for just the buffet!",3,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We were seated at a low table in the patio area.  We were brought menus immediately and our drink order was taken.  In a short time, our server--I believe Markiya was her name--came to take our order.

My wife ordered a Philly cheesesteak and I ordered the Reuben.  We were told that a basket of fries was better than two separate orders.  We got the garlic fries.

Both sandwiches were very large and very good.  The garlic fries were very good!   

Service was good.  My iced tea was refilled a couple of times and I didn't need to   ask.  I normally would give a four star rating but the noise level was awful.  It was the first day of the college football season and there were some loud viewers in the main restaurant.  Also, being located where it is along the Miravle Mile Shops walkway makes for more noise.  A plus though is the oppoprtunity to watch tourists.  That's always a lot of fun.  Prices here are also high.  I can get as good in my neighborhood for less money and less driving.

I had been wanting to try Little Miss BBQ's heavenly smoked meats since its inception, but did not want to wait in the long lines. They do offer pick up/to go orders for meat orders totaling 5 lbs. or more so I placed an order through e-mail for 5 lbs. plus BBQ sauce and sides. Note that you have to place an order about one week in advance for them to be able to prepare it for you (By 4 P.M. Friday for an order the following week). I invited some friends over so we could share in this meaty feast!

We got:
2+ lbs. beef short rib ($20 per pound, only sold on Friday and Saturday. Each rib is about a pound so you can get an idea of how much to order)
1 lb. pulled pork ($14.50 per pound)
2 lbs. fatty brisket ($19 per pound)
1 pint jalapeño cheddar grits ($4)
1 pint BBQ beans ($4)
1 squeeze bottle house BBQ sauce ($2)
Pickles, onions, jalapeños, and the happiness that you feel when you eat good food (Priceless ;) )

I received a confirmation e-mail about a day later with a pick up time of 10:15. We got there a little early at 10 and there were already about 5 people waiting in line before the official opening at 11. The order took only a few short minutes to be made and the cashier was friendly and cheerful. Apparently they had just completed an order for the Cardinals before we came by to pick up our meal. Nice!

The delicious aroma of slowly BBQ'd meat taunted us while we were in the car driving home. Opening up the packages was like opening up a present on Christmas day :). The brisket and short rib had an amazing rich bark on it, and all the meats had smoke rings for days... My favorite of all the meats were the short ribs. They weren't very short looking, as they were gigantic bones the size of my forearm. :) It was everything you'd want in BBQ: deep smoky flavor, lovely bark crust, and tender texture. The fatty brisket was my second favorite, also being very tender and full of flavor. The pulled pork was good as well, but it's harder to get brisket and short rib right so I applaud them on their BBQ perfection!

The sides were also quite good, and the squeeze bottle filled with house BBQ sauce was a steal at $2. I loved the tangy flavor, with perfect consistency, and not too sweet.

If you can plan ahead and invest in the bulk pick up order, this is the way to go! No lines, and you'll have amazing BBQ in the comfort of your own home.",50,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

One of our chef series meals was at Naked City Pizza on Paradise where Chef Palmeri served the group some of the dishes he was tinkering with to serve at the now open Naked City Tavern, a 24 hour gaming bar and restaurant just south of Sunset Road on Pecos.

Five of us gathered for brunch to try the new menu items and to see the new Naked City Tavern.  There are three menus available depending on time of day.  One is the overnight one from 10 PM to 11 AM menu.  The second one is 11 AM to 11 PM.  The other menu is the normal Naked City Pizza menu which consists of pizza and the other items served at the two other Naked City locations.

Standouts were the Dutch Babies--a cast iron skillet pancake with berry topping and vanilla cream, the bacon risotto, Nutella French toast, the Hot Mama, the yellowtail crudo, and the foie gras-duck confit tacos.  In other words, almost everything served was an outstanding dish with lots of creativity.  This is a place where two can share a few items.  Be aware that the Hot Mama is superb but there is so much to it that it would easily fill one person.  The crudo was outstanding with such an interesting and flavorful item as pickled blueberries around the base of the fish.  The Rebel pizza was very good.

In short, brunch was excellent.  This is a grand addition to Naked City lineup.",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I walked in and stopped at the podium but there was no one in sight.  I walked down the ramp into the bar area and again not a soul in sight.  After a short wait, a woman came to the bar area and I asked about breakfast.  They do have breakfast and I could sit anywhere I wanted.  I was the only customer at about 8:30 AM.

The server brought me a menu and then brought a hot cup of coffee.  The menu is sparse for breakfast--there are only 7 items.  This is a young person's beer drinking, pong playing kind of place and breakfast would not be a big draw.  Regardless, I chose the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich the menu describes as ""griddled Texas toast with American cheese, bacon, tomato and fried eggs served with tater tots.""

Within a short time, my plate was brought.  The tater tots were standard ones that had not been deep fried again but were most likely heated in a microwave.  The sandwich was good with crispy bacon.  The interplay of tomato, cheese, and egg was good.  The server came back and refilled my coffee.  She was a very pleasant woman and her service was excellent.

After paying, I took the opportunity to check out the changes since I had been there before.  The cowboy/Western theme is pretty much gone.  Where there had been booths on the south side secondary eating area, there are now large window doors to open the place up to the patio that's enclosed with a fence.  It also has artificial grass which is a plus for our water use.  I'm sure this is a great place to enjoy some of their large selection of beers and socialize. 

It was also in this area where I locked my bike.  It was inside the main door but before the second set of doors into the restaurant.  That gave some security by not having the bike outside facing Flamingo Road.

I'd come back again.  For Sunday breakfast while others are sleeping in or sleeping it off, it was a quiet place.",4,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

After trying in vain to acquire 3 tables with no avail, I finally snagged one after maneuvering my way to a table whose patrons had just left.

Even though we were eating at a fast food restaurant, I appreciated the fact that they had a staff member on hand only to clean up, wipe down tables, and take away trays as needed. He was very friendly and attentive.

The menu offers plates and sandwiches with various sides. The cashier today was Chad and he did an excellent job explaining their selections and offering samples of sauce so I could get the perfect accompaniment for my meal. 

I had the regular size pulled pork sandwich with javelina sauce and a side of fried okra. The pork had that lovely pink smoke ring tinge, and the meat had a nice combination of textures from the outer crispier portion and the softer inner sections of meat. I loved the javelina sauce. It is essentially a spicy green chile sauce. It had flavor, heat, and good consistency and went well with the sandwich. I also enjoyed the coleslaw, which was lightly dressed but still flavorful and the addition of apple to the mix was a surprising and tasty extra component. The sandwich was reasonably priced ($5.99) and was a large portion that definitely left me satisfied after wolfing it down! The only slight negative was that the bun got progressively soggier as I ate more of the sandwich so that at the end it was a pile o' mush when I took my last few bites.

The fried okra ($1.99) had a light crisp batter with tender vegetable. It was a great side to go with the sandwich.

Service from both the staff members here was very friendly and cheerful. You can tell they are passionate and dedicated to the product they sell here.

Since then I've been practicing to gain more accuracy and speed and have been trying out different handguns to see which one will be ""the one.""  Most of my experiences have been at Caswell's, since it's the closest indoor range to where I live.  After trying out a variety of semi-autos at Caswell's, I wanted to try out a few Berettas that were offered only at SGC.

If I had to pick SGC or Caswell's, I'd pick Caswell's.  The facility here at SGC looks newer, and there is more selection for renting, but my experience here was odd, and I'm not sure I'd go here again.  First of all, when I tried to call their number to see if a particular semi auto was available for rent, the phone rang and rang... and rang... no one picked up.  Whenever I've called at Caswell's I've always been able to reach someone on the phone.  So, I left it up to chance and made the drive up to North Scottsdale (and hoped that the website was updated).  When I got there I asked the associate at the counter how long of a wait there was for a lane.  She replied curtly ""There's no lanes open.""  Well.... that wasn't really answering my question, but OK...  

Since it was my first time here I had to fill out a 2 page waiver and watch a video on the 4 safety principles of using guns.  The website said you could skip it if you watched it online, but when I told the associate at the counter she also replied in the same curt tone that the one they had online was shorter.  Comparing the two, there was only like, 1 or 2 minutes of extra footage that was kind of self-evident stuff about gun safety.  

Going up to rent my semi-auto, they did not have the caliber I wanted, despite saying they had it on the website.  So, I opted for the same gun, but in a different caliber.  The lanes are operated electronically like Caswell's, although the ones here run better and seem newer.  The really odd part of my experience here was I went out to get another box of ammo, and when I came back, my target was gone!  I looked around, and even looked in the trash to see if someone had thrown it out, but it wasn't there.  WTF, what kind of klepto steals used targets from a gun range?  

Now while the first associate wasn't very friendly at all, the others that I got ammo and rented guns from were a lot friendlier.  But it only takes one unfriendly associate to alter your perception of a place. Now that I've tried Scottsdale Gun Club and the facility, I'll take the cheaper rates, older facility, but better customer service at Caswell's over Scottsdale Gun Club.

Total price (not including tax): 
$15 Handgun rental
$20.99 .45 ACP per box
$15 lane fee per person
Bull's eye style targets $.70 per target",6,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The latest time I saw the show, I was awfully disappointed.  What had been the best music for any Dragone or Cirque show was now changed in several places and jazzed up.  Some of Benoît Jutras' songs have been dropped, some changed in tempo, and others mere shells of their former selves.

In trying to get away from ""O,"" Wynn has changed Le Reve so it's less water show and more ""Dancing With the Stars.""  I think part of the decision was to break from ""O"" but also was brought about by the design of the theatre.  It is a superb theatre with truly no bad seats in the house.  Since it's in the round, the problem becomes that sets can only be changed through the water or lowered from above.  This led to the earlier ""up and down"" blues of the earlier version.  Swimmers went up and down and up and down.  With a new emphasis on dance, the need for set changes is lessened, and you can have different things going on and no new sets--just new music.

The final disappointment for me was the dropping of the pre-show entertainment by the guys dressed in white.  This little pre-show playful interaction between performers and the audience was always so welcomed.  Now, there's nothing, but Wynn wanted a higher class show.  

My summary is that the show is OK, but it's a mere shell of how good it once was.  This is one show I won't see again!",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The menu consists of breakfast, lunch, coffee, tea and smoothies. I had the avocado-egg-balsamic toast with an iced latte. Although it was pretty busy this late morning it came out quickly. The toast had a very generous spread of creamy avocado, sliced hard boiled eggs and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. Overall it was pretty good. I would have liked an additional hit of acidic flavor or a different texture to balance out the creaminess and smooth textures of the avocado and eggs, maybe a thin slice of tomato on top or pickled onions would help? The bread was well toasted but a bit tough to eat with the other ingredients as the crust was very hard to bite into.

The iced latte was smooth, refreshing and delicious. There was no hint of bitterness whatsoever and it was a perfect complement to go with the toast.

Since AZ Combat Sports offers new students a free first class, I joined Ms. Official Badass Grace O. in an evening hour-long Muay Thai session of punching, pivoting and sweating. After filling out the necessary paperwork (A form basically saying don't sue them If you get hurt practicing, etc.), I was given a tour, and introduced to many cool and experienced students in BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-jitsu), MMA, and Muay Thai. 

The class started with some cardio (Jump rope), then moved on to stretching and some muscle strength exercises. Since everyone else was not a newbie, the assistant instructor then gave me an individualized intro class where I learned the basics of punching while the others practiced kicks and punches with a partner.

Since I used to take kenpo, a lot of the muscle memory I've retained doesn't fit into the style of Muay Thai fighting, at least where striking and hand movements are concerned. The instructor was patient though as he guided me through the different moves. I have to say I was a little disappointed I didn't get to kick anything today but I understand that you gotta start with the basics if you want to build a solid foundation of skills.

Compared to a krav maga class I took a few years ago, I liked the atmosphere here better, and I appreciated the personal instruction. While the krav maga class has you jump right into action, practicing attack scenarios, the Muay Thai class focused more on form so that the punches and kicks you deliver have the most bang for your buck.

I stopped in here Monday only to find the same kind of line that Christine A described.  After about standing for 10 minutes, an employee came down the line and asked what phone I wanted, the 6 or the 6 Plus.  I didn't know so I was told I could go in the store, look, decide, and come back out and make my reservation.  I just told her I'd go to Town Square at which time she pointed out that there'd be a line there too.  She advised me to come early.

Yesterday, I went back about 10 minutes before opening and I was third in line.  When the store opened, I went in and looked at both and made my decision.  I then came out and told her which model I wanted.  There was another wait until it was my time to purchase.

Next up was the person who brought the phone to me and went through the trade in of the old one and the purchase of the new one.  Then I was taken to the setup table where I was handed off to a third person who got me started on the setup process, most of which I did on my own but he was around so I could ask a question when I needed to.  The slowest part of the whole thing was the wait for the backup from the cloud to load all my apps from the old phone.  After two hours at the store, I was done and left with my purchase.  I wasn't offered nor given a bag.  It was, ""Awesome, you're done!""

I understand that the iPhone 6 is very popular as was the 5 when it came out.  It seems like they've made this process unnecessarily circuitous,  Also, when I arrived Monday, there was no one around to explain why the line nor what one was supposed to do.  I have to give the employees kudos for their service for the most part.  But Apple, please tell your youngsters that buying an iPhone is not awesome.  I think I heard the word at least once in every other sentence from all three employees with whom I dealt.  The Grand Canyon is awesome.  An iPhone is nice, great, but please, go easy on the awesome!

I'm glad the store is so close to my home--just about 3/4 mile.  Since I've had an Apple computer and successors since 1984, I will be back.  I love their products.

Finally, when I left yesterday, there was no line.  The store has been open less than a week so I suppose that I was just in the midst of the rush.  But I should have gone to Town Square Monday.",5,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

While the amenities are a bit older than other spas, and a bit more basic, if you get a service such as a massage, it includes use of the facilities for the whole day.  We had a couple's massage here, and the massage therapist did a pretty good job with working out the omnipresent knots in my back and shoulders.  It was a good mix of relaxation and therapeutic massage.  At $210 for both of us, it seemed a bit pricey to me, although since it is a spa environment in Scottsdale, higher prices are to be expected.  They also have a harsh cancellation policy that I wish I could get away with at my own business and still stay afloat!  If you cancel within 24 hours of your appointment time, they will charge you the full amount of your service.  To be charged $210 if an emergency or something happened within 24 hours and I couldn't make the appointment made me feel a bit uneasy- good thing it was a normal day for me!

We were excited to try out the facilities, but there are a few things that need to be updated or fixed.  For instance, the steam room was lukewarm and it seemed like the controls were broken.  The steam room itself is very basic, with blue tile, and just steam, no other therapeutic scents.  There is a pool and jacuzzi outside, which we used for a bit.  There were a lot of leaves in the pool, and there was some dirt both in the pool and the jacuzzi accumulating.  They have flotation noodles and pool rafts for you to use to float in the pool with, but the pool rafts were very dirty and caked with sand, even after trying to rinse off all the dirt with water.  The whirlpool itself is a nice hot temperature, but the knob to activate the ""whirlpool"" feature was missing so we sat in hot, calm water rather than whirlpool type water.  Another option that I found missing was a ""cold"" room so that you can alternate between a hot environment and a cold to invigorate the senses.

They have a bar with fresh fruit, iced water, iced tea, coffee, and a nice selection of hot teas to choose from when you are relaxing in the atrium.  

In general, while Spa Lamar is a decent place to get a spa service from, it isn't the most posh.  So far I'd say the best experience I've had in Arizona would be at Joya, but prices here are more reasonable than Joya, so it is true that you get what you pay for.",3,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The arena itself is OK.  I had seats in the second section from the stage in the 5th row off the stage.  They were good seats.  I've also been here when I was at the turn in the horseshoe of seating and the seats were painful to get in and out of.  In addition, I needed the Hubble Telescope to see the performers.

The ushers were helpful, Metro was accommodating with approving my camera (the screener at the metal detectors thought it needed special attention).  One complaint, if TM and AXS are going to encourage electronic tickets on smartphones, have more than one line where your entry can be scanned.  It's absurd to move all of us who are not wasting paper to go to one line to get in.  Even the Las Vegas Academy High School can scan smartphone and paper. 

The arena is always clean--well to start the evening.  Getting out is now a lot easier after the near stampede following one of the large prize fights.  Walk up to the plaza level, go through one of the doors that says exit to stairwell, and down the steps and outside and you're close to the garage.

I had some margherita pizza ($13) and biancoverde ($16).  The margherita pizza was made with fresh ingredients, but it just tasted OK, nothing too special (Good crust though).  I was more intrigued by the biancoverde pizza.  The creamy ricotta and mozzarella meshed well with the more piquant taste of the parmigiano-reggiano and the almost nutty, crispy taste of the arugula.  The pizza was somewhat oily in the center and slightly soggy in the middle though, but that didn't detract me too much from liking the biancoverde.  

We were a large party of 8, and service was OK.  Minus some points for not getting a sugar basket for our iced teas despite asking for one (I like them sweet!).  The iced teas themselves ($3, free refills) while nice in that they were organic, really didn't have too much taste to me.  It was so mild I thought I was drinking colored water.  They offer Mexican Coke in glass bottles ($2.50), which is a nice touch for those that want real sugar in their regular Coke.

Ibby, you make a mighty tasty fried chicken and fish! I was feeling particularly gluttonous today and decided to get a to-go order of fried catfish and chicken. The order was ready in 15 minutes and well packaged for me to take it back.

The combo came with 2 sides. I went with the collard greens and mac and cheese. The order came with a small container of hot sauce, tartar sauce, plenty of napkins, and utensils. 

The fish and chicken had slightly different batter to go with the each meat, and both were delicious. The crispy coating was light and well seasoned. The combo came with one piece of fish and 2 pieces of dark meat chicken (Leg and thigh). There wasn't a lot of meat on the chicken and some parts of the unbattered thigh were dried out but the rest of the meat was tender. The fish was very fresh and had a very soft texture to go with the crispy coating. If I had to choose between the two, I'd prefer the fried fish over the chicken.

As for the sides, the mac and cheese was an excellent rendition of perfectly cooked pasta and creamy cheesy sauce. The collard greens were too vinegary/salty for my tastes though.

Service was very warm and friendly. The total price was $15+ with tax which I felt was a little expensive for what I got. The overall quality of the food though was great and I look forward to going here again for more Southern style dishes.",18,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

That's a heck of a deal! The decor is like '80s-90s style, and the layout is spacious and uncluttered. The dishes are a mix of Thai and Chinese style dishes you'll definitely find something pleasing to get at the buffet.

There were quite a few items to choose from, such as tempura vegetables, wonton salad, chicken curry, eggplant, BBQ pork, and the ubiquitous pad Thai. My favorites of the bunch were probably the BBQ pork and the fried fish. The curries had a mildly spicy kick with a lot of meat but had a very thin watery sauce.

They had two soups today, a seafood (krab) egg drop soup and what looked to be hot and sour soup with mushrooms. I tried the egg drop soup which had good flavor but had a very thick consistency.

Desserts included small Chinese style donut holes and fresh fruit such as melon, orange, and pineapple.

The quality in general isn't the best but for the price the buffet is a good deal especially since iced tea is included.

This restaurant has been here forever it seems like, since I remember seeing the big Pink Pepper sign as a kid. They're definitely doing something right if they've been here for decades!

There is literally no bad seat in the house, since the theater is so small.  Since it is so small, it is amazing what acrobatics the performers can do in just a small amount of space.  Le Reve captures many elements and emotions into a single 1.5 hour show: love, beauty, mystery, comedy, and the list goes on.

It's a little shop in the mall off of entrance 5. The menu has hot and cold drinks, with preset flavors and also the option to make your own tea based on type, sweetener, sweetness, and milk product. I like how they offer coconut milk if you don't want a dairy product in your drink, and they have sweeteners such as honey and agave nectar.

I decided on the large size dark matter because the combination of taro with chocolate intrigued me. The drink automatically comes with honey boba. It was a blended drink so it had a slushie-like consistency. First, the good: the boba was a nice chewy texture and lightly sweet. The neutral: I could taste both the chocolate and taro in the drink; it seemed a little more chocolaty in flavor though. The bad: the drink had a powdery/grainy taste to it. Also, I appreciate that they have special wide cups for the bubble tea but they are so wide that you can't put them in your car's cup holder if you get it to go.

The food was excellent!  The Andhra curry with chicken was beautifully spiced.  I got it at a spice level of 7 on a 1-10 scale.  I could have done eight or nine.  There was some kick but I like it spicier, not inferno, but reasonably spicy for normal people.  The samosas were good with good ground lamb and the basmati rice was well prepared.  The garlic naan rounded out a nice meal along with the gulab jamun for dessert.

Now to the service.  When I arrived, there were two tables besides me occupied.  There were perhaps four people covering the floor.  One man took by order for the samosas while I looked at the menu trying to decide on the main course.  He also asked for my drink order.  I asked for iced tea and he responded with sweet or unsweetened.  Unsweetened it was and he brought me a small dish with some regular sugar and several artificial sweetener packs.  Shortly into eating the samosas, when my tea wasn't even down a third, a server asked if I wanted a tea refill.  I responded with a not right now.

I finished the samosas, the curry, and my gulab jamun before someone picked up the empty glass--it had been for much of my meal by then--and brought it back full.  I added a packet of sweetener and then tasted this awful flavor because they had brought the sweetened tea which now had artificial sweetener also in it.  It tasted like raspberry tea but I only took a swallow or two and then left the rest.

There was a woman going around with a tablet taking orders from tables which are then instantly sent to the kitchen.  She seemed to be the key employee tonight.  When I was brought my bill, I saw that there was a large error.  The gulab jamun was charged at $80.  (I did not post the photo of that bill but I have it).  The person who brought the check went after the tablet carrier who then was occupied with a party of 4 at the ""self serve"" by the ounce wine and beer area.  I can see why it can't be completely self serve.  I have friends who would drink them dry unless monitored.  This, however, held up the redoing of the bill.

The service seemed like there was no coordination nor clear cut responsibilities.  No dirty dishes were removed from the table except for the samosa one.  All my dishes from the main course were on the table when the gulab jamun was brought.  I lifted my dinner plate to make room and placed it to the left and away from the eating area.  The person who brought the gulab then picked up that plate and took it but nothing else was ever cleared from the table while I was there.   It's been a month so they have had time to train the staff and the staff has had time to do their jobs.

The big beef had a heaping layer of beef on it, with extra gravy/broth (Standard order, although you can modify it as you like). I usually like my Italian beef full dip, but it was easier to eat it with less broth, and as you ate the sandwich, you would get different bites of broth soaked bread and unsoaked bread, making it kind of like you are eating 2 different sandwiches in one. I got it with hot and sweet peppers, and mozzarella, all blending well flavor-wise with the sandwich.

The onion rings had a very crunchy breading, and one order was a decent size. The chocolate cake shake was everything you'd imagine it to be: Thick, chocolatey, rich, with blended bits of chocolate cake in each sip. Definitely a good way to ruin a diet!

The seating at Shady Park is for both businesses so your menu will have both pizza/bar options as well as ramen options, and while you slurp your noodles at your table your neighbor might be enjoying a slice of pepperoni with bread sticks.

The interior itself is very retro. It has a cavernous, '70s vibe to it. The ramen menu itself has a set base price of $8 that includes your choice of broth, and will include pickled bamboo shoots, scallions, naruto (Fish cake), carrot flower, nori (Seaweed) and spinach. There are a multitude of add-ins you can have for an extra charge. I had the paitan broth and added soft egg ($1.50) and seared tofu ($1). The paitan broth was full flavored and rich and I loved the soft egg and tofu with the other included add-ins. I was disappointed that they only give you one naruto piece and one carrot flower for your bowl. It's definitely not enough for the bowl they give you! The noodles themselves were the typical curly ramen noodle shape and texture. I do prefer the noodles at Tampopo ramen more though because they are freshly made in house and have a good ""bite"" to them.

Next time I'm in the ASU area again I'll be back to try more ramen!",16,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

The interior is bright and contemporary with digital menu signs and a good amount of seating. I decided on the veggie combo hummus bowl and redeemed a Yelp check in offer for free hummus and pita chips ($1.99 value). 

The bowl comes with your choice of hummus, rice or lentils, salad, dressing, pita with falafel on top. I chose the original hummus, lentils, soft pita, vinaigrette and tabouli salad. As a whole I liked the bowl, with the combinations of textures and flavors that meshed well together. The falafel was a sizable portion with a rock hard outer layer but was soft on the inside. I could only finish about half of the bowl for lunch. My total for the bowl with tax was around $8, not bad for the amount of food I got.

The hummus I chose for the check in offer was the jalapeno cilantro hummus. While I liked the spiciness and flavor from the jalapeno overall I wasn't a big fan of the flavor which seemed a bit one dimensional for me. The texture of the hummus was a bit grainy to me as well. I did enjoy the pita chips which were light and crispy though.

Service was very friendly.

Very bad things, like pee on your dry-clean only quilt just for the heck of it. Off to Permaclean I went, in hopes to clean this now-stinky, filthy quilt. Searching for prices online, I was expecting a large dent in my wallet to clean this stinky mess, but was pleasantly surprised when I was quoted around $25 for my queen size quilt. Unfortunately, they weren't able to dry clean the quilt due to the pee, and had to wet clean it, which made me a bit anxious that the colors would bleed (My sister has the same quilt and the colors faded and bled like heck when she put hers in the washer).

Another restaurant that I've wanted to try now marked off the list.  The Restaurant Week menu is somewhat limited in selections, but what it has was very good.

I was seated next to the window overlooking the Bellagio and the fountains which added to the good atmosphere of the restaurant.  I was brought menus and an iced tea.  I had to ask for the Restaurant Week menu and it was brought.  I had already made my choice from the online menu but sometimes things change so I wanted to make sure.

I was brought a nice bread basket with sourdough and three other breads.  Accompanying it was a trio of bread toppers/dippers--mascarpone butter, caponata, and a citrus infused olive oil.  All three were good, but I could have eaten a plate of the caponata!  The mild citrus flavor in the olive oil made that my second choice.

For the starter, I ordered the creamy polenta with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.  The polenta was brought in a white dish and the server then spooned the onion and wild mushroom mixture over the polenta.  The dish was excellent.  I almost took some bread to wipe up any leftover polenta.

For the main course, I got the fennel dusted black cod on a bed of concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel.  The fish was cooker perfectly and was moist and soft but with a crisp crust.  The crust had a mild anise flavor from the fennel.  The tomatoes beneath, concentrated by baking until some of the water was rendered which gave the tomato a prominent flavor.  The roasted fennel was tasty.

For dessert, there was no choice but that didn't matter.  The bomboloni was a wonderful way to end a good meal.  The bomboloni consisted of two filled with Nutella ganache and one was filled with a vanilla cream.  Alongside was a small scoop of banana ice cream resting on crushed chocolate shortbread pieces.  Excellent!

Service was good for the most part.  Two small things--when your posted opening time is 6 PM, open at 6.  Seating people almost 10 minutes late is not the best form especially if someone has a show they need to get to.  Also, I had two Sweet 'n Low wrappers on the table that neither a runner nor the server cleared even though both were by several times.  That's something you wouldn't expect from a restaurant of this class.  I'm sure Chef Conant would point this out if he were dining there.  I wish I didn't have to ask for the Restaurant Week menu.  It was a sheet of paper.  Bring it with your large books of wine and dinner menus.",16,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Zoyo yogurt, when I went here at least, seems skewed more towards the creamier yogurts rather than the tangy fruitier ones, and they do have a few interesting flavors such as oatmeal cookie and banana bread.  The toppings are left uncovered, and as a result the fruitier and softer toppings have a tendency to get either dried out, or a bit wilted.  Such was the case with the little mochis available as a topping.  It took some digging to get the softer mochis since the ones on the very top were rock hard.  If you enjoy more candy-like toppings and chocolatey toppings, as well as more creamy-based yogurts,  this is probably the place for you.",0,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

When we were seated we were served a chilled crudite platter and bread with a flavorful leek-garlic mixture. After browsing through the menu I went for the 12 oz prime rib (~$38) and I also tried some of the rib eye. The prime rib is some of the best that I can remembering eating. It was so tender, flavorful, and juicy. Cutting through the meat was like cutting through butter it was that tender. The ribeye was cooked to perfection and very flavorful.

We ended our meal with a divine strawberry shortcake. It was the perfect amount of sweetness, creaminess, fruity flavor, and definitely a big plate so it was good that 4 of us were sharing it!

Service was impeccable as drinks were refilled constantly, our server was warm, friendly, and very knowledgeable about the menu, and a manager even stopped by to chat with us.

Cornbread with sweet butter, strawberry jam, and local honey

There's a lot going on at Isabela's.  Chef Beni has put together a rather large brunch menu.  The dishes that stood out for me were the brioche flan French toast, the garlic pollo, the red crab sweet corn bisque, the Cubano panini, the sweet potato fries with bleu cheese, the chopped chicken salad, the white chocolate brioche bread pudding, and the churros.

For the savories, the standouts were the chicken which had lots of garlic taste in the rich sauce.  The brioche flan French toast was delicious with nicely browned brioche pieces with maple syrup. The crab bisque had a rich flavor with a good amount of crab.  The panini was oozing cheese.  The chopped chicken salad was a large   brunch item in itself with thin, fried plantain in the salad for design.  The combination of bleu cheese with the sweet potato fries was superb!  I generally do not get sweet potato fries, but if they were all served this way, I'd change my ways.

For the sweets--reason enough to come here--my two standouts were the white chocolate brioche bread pudding and the churros.  Both were very good takes on two dishes generally served in a different manner.  The churros were more like doughnut holes but had a much richer flavor and the dipping/pouring over liquid chocolate was a perfect accompaniment.  The bread pudding was unlike most bread pudding in that it was soft bread pudding triangles much like pieces of waffle but of totally different texture.

The menu is almost overwhelming.  I'm not sure if I'd have known what to pick if I had come here out of the blue.  Having Chef Beni pick our menu was a good start.  Perhaps the menu needs to be tightened up some.",14,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The meatloaf was dense and packed with flavor. The hash browns, as always, were excellent, cooked on the griddle perfectly. I opted for a biscuit, which was a large fist-sized portion, light and fluffy tasting. It was so much food I could only finish about half.

Perfectly topped with whipped cream, creamy caramel, sea salt and a Ghirardelli SQUARES® Milk Chocolate.  Once I saw salt, I stopped reading and knew this was the one.

The sundae was very good and they did not spare the sea salt which is what I  liked about the combination.  The cup is not the most convenient way to eat this sundae and the spoon was a bit flimsy.

The cup had chocolate on the bottom and the ice creamed packed in had almost solidified that part of the chocolate.  Don't give up and don't despair.  Push that flimsy spoon to its limit and get every bit of chocolate goodness out of the bottom of that cup.

Coup Des Tartes: a sudden attempt by a small group of people to take over your taste buds by serving you delicious food (From Karen W).

The actual restaurant is adorable, set in a renovated cottage style house with a few different rooms and a large patio with twinkling overhead lights. We were seated in the fireplace room which allowed for a more intimate setting. 

The menu, as their website states, is ""French-inspiration American"" and is touted to be all-natural and organic, as well as locally sourced. The menu had a fairly diverse selection of items, from red meat, chicken, seafood, and pasta. I didn't see any vegetarian options aside from the salads and appetizers though. 

We started with the French onion soup and three onion tarte. The French onion soup was superb, with its rich broth, soft caramelized onions, toasted bread, and melted cheese. I loved the layers of flavor and different combinations of textures. The three onion tart was a delicious combination of flaky and soft, buttery, savory and sweet textures and flavors. 

For entrees we had the daily special: lamp chops with roasted vegetables and peach glaze, and the coq au vin. Both were excellent. The lamb chops had a slight crispy outer crust, were perfectly cooked on the inside, and had wonderful flavor. The coq au vin was exquisite. The chicken was so tender and the wine sauce was nuanced, with perfect seasoning and went well with the meat. It was served with tangy (buttermilk?) mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. 

Service was impeccable from our friendly waiter to our warm and welcoming hostess. 

We were so full but didn't want to leave without dessert so we asked for the brown butter pear tart to go. It was packaged nicely, with the tart in one box and extra salted caramel sauce and creme Anglaise in another small box. It was a heavenly concoction, not too sweet, with a great balance of flavors.

Rounding out the first plate was some pasta Bolognese which had a surprising amount of heat from ground red pepper.  It was pretty good for a buffet.  Someone wasn't afraid to spice things up a bit.

For the second plate, I got some sushi roll slices which was standard buffet type.  I got two pieces of spicy Portuguese sausage which was quite good, and I went back for more of the pasta.  I loved the pepper heat of it.

I had some carrot cake and a chocolate pudding for dessert.  These were standard buffet type desserts.  Nothing special but not bad.

The staff was a little slow with bringing my first iced tea but when she did bring it, she brought two glasses at once which was nice.  

The buffet is OK but for the price, I'd go to others which have a better selection of items.",13,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,18,2016-01-08,24,epEvgNiLJigdDVY9OvaNlw,2,"I wanted to try this new restaurant before going to see Celine.  I arrived five minutes early and shortly the hostess on the first floor called an elevator for me and I went to the second floor where Mr. Chow is located.  A maître d' came out and introduced himself and said I would be seated shorty. The staff was going through its kung fu before starting service.  Check my photo for this definition of kung fu.  It has nothing to do with marshall arts.

In a minute or so, a familiar face appeared at the hostess stand--it was Mr. Chow.  He asked my name and the name of the woman who had arrived shortly after me.  He took the two of us into the restaurant and introduced us to the entire staff.  The staff then finished with a countdown after Mr. Chow asked them if they were going to give us the best service there was.  I'm paraphrasing.  I was taken to my seat and menus were placed and I was asked about water and drinks.  Tap and iced tea.  Standard for me.  It was about then that the kinetic sculpture descended and starting going through its 5 minute show.  Quite interesting and innovative.

My server was a bit concerned about me dining alone as there plates are meant to be shared and maybe I should have a few apps and sort of do it like a taps place (my words).  That wasn't why I was there.  I studied the menu and picked out three items.  He had suggested a double order of chicken satay, but I decided on a single order--which consists of one satay--and I ordered the turnip puffs.  I also ordered the With Three dish.  It should be noted there is a $40 minimum charge per person.  Not to worry, this threshold is very easy to surpass.

After my water and iced tea were brought, a runner came with Mr. Chow's homemade hot sauce.  Shortly, another runner brought the chicken satay and a very hot share plate with the Mr. Chow name on it.  The chicken satay was a bit disappointing.  The sauce on it didn't flavor it all that much and it was a standard chicken satay.

My second course was the turnip puffs.  There were six in the order and the pastry was done nicely.  I did use some of the hot sauce with these and the hot sauce rescued the puffs from tasteless oblivion.  This made the experience so far at 0 for 2.

The main course was brought.  The With Three consists of prawns, chicken, calves liver and sea mushroom sautéed in wine (quoting from the menu).  The sea mushroom was outstanding!  I think there was one prawn with much chicken and some calves liver.  This was really a different dish and that's what struck me as I was looking through the menu.  Unless you eat like a super model--or maybe I eat too much--this was not a dish to be shared unless a couple is ordering several dishes and tasting a little of each.  For one person, it's not hard to render the plate empty.

After the table was cleared, a woman came pushing the dessert trolley through.  Lychee, carrot cake, rummed oranges, I believe, a triple chocolate cake, and some others.  I got the triple chocolate cake and it was the winner of the evening.

Service was excellent almost to the point of being overdone--patronizingly so.  Everyone is very pleasant.  They haven;'t had their grand  opening yet, I was told, and they'll have no problem with it.  This staff knows its stuff pretty well.  There were a few mistakes in the menu in my case but nothing terrible.

Spending the amount I did, I would have hoped I left with more positive thoughts about the dining experience.  Instead, I'll remember three important words--Spring Mountain Road.",43,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

When I asked about the spiciness of the barbacoa, the waiter said it was a red sauce with a little spice.  When informed that I liked spicy food, he said he'd tell them to make it spicier.  He did, it was, and boy did I like it.  Extra red cili seasonings gave a zip to the dish.  The beans were also well spiced and had some wonderful cotija cheese for garnish.  The rice was standard Mexican restaurant rice--nothing terribly good nor bad about it.  You also have your choice of flour or corn tortillas.

The Thanksgiving special of the night was your choice of turkey pot pie or sliced turkey with mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and stuffing ($38 for either option).  I went with the more traditional sliced turkey breast (free range), which was juicy and flavorful.  The stuffing was an interesting mix of the dark meat of the turkey with bread stuffing.  Unfortunately, it was very salty which made it difficult to eat.  The cranberry sauce was excellent, with just the right amount of sweet and tart flavor, and the mashed potatoes were, well, just your standard mashed potatoes (albeit freshly made).  

Prior to the turkey, I had the gnocchi appetizer, which was delicious and perfectly cooked.  In a similar vein, someone that had the French onion soup remarked that it was the best French onion soup he's ever had.

Chica takes the spot of the former DB Brasserie in the Venetian.  I went for Restaurant Week dinner and I chose (with menu descriptions):

Empanadas Pabellon - Crispy arepa masa stuffed with braised ground beef, sweet plantains, black beans, queso fresco and spicy guasacaca pico
Porchetta with crispy yucca hash - Slow roasted suckling pig, crispy brussels sprouts, fried yucca, pearl onion escabeche, pork jus
Tres leches dulce de leche - Traditional ""Three milks"" cake topped with toasted meringue, with exotic fruit pico

The empanadas were the let down of the meal.  You can see from the photo that the one was especially crisp and the bottom of that one was blacker in one spot.  Someone needs to watch the grill more carefully.  The empanadas were OK but they need more moisture.  The porchetta was flavored well and was juicy.  It had a crisp exterior.  The pork jus made the porchetta even more juicy.

The tres leches cake was the real winner of the night.  Excellent cake-moist throughout from the three milks.

Service was good but sometimes it was too good.  There was a busser who kept walking back and forth and took dirty plates almost as soon as you put down your silverware.

There are several ways you can do it or you can just walk around and explore and look at the marvelous sandstone formations.  Most of the photos I've posted are from 2004 when I first went to the Bowl of Fire.  

Two routes will get you here as Ron says in his review.  For most people, you'll park at around mile 18 on Northshore Road.  There's a pull off parking area on the left side of the road.  From there, hike across the desert and around the hill.  When you get around the hill, you'll see the Bowl of Fire in the distance and the way to go.  There are several trails across the desert.  The only difficulty here is picking up the trail on the other side of several washes.

Once inside the bowl, I usually go to the left and follow the trail around the southern part of the bowl, up a ridge, down the other side, and eventually complete a large loop.  There's some rock scrambling to this route and you really should wear something more than sneakers for the hike.  Hiking boots will help you keep your traction on the steeper ups and downs.

If you go, take plenty of water with you.  Also, be aware of where you're going.  After awhile, the sandstone may all look alike and you need to know your way out.",11,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I had read the concept of this place on Yelp and I studied the menu.  My wife told me what she wanted and I knew also.  Off I was.

Since the Groupon was for $25, I made the two meals manga size which is an extra $2.99 for a larger serving.  For my wife, the pomodoro fresco with angel hair pasta, tomatoes, marinara, and parmesan and Romano cheeses.  For me, Crazy Alfredo which is fettuccini with chicken, Italian sausage, roasted red peppers, shrimp, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and jalapeños.  We also got a side of sweet corn with creamy parmesan sauce.  Since I was already getting a deal with the Groupon, I didn't double dip and use the Yelp check in offer of free garlic bread.

Everything except the breakfast menu is monster/horror themed, and the breakfast menu on Sundays runs until 2 P.M., a nice perk for those that are late risers.  Prices for breakfast will run around the 7-8 dollar range, unless you get steak and eggs, which is $14.  

We ordered a myriad of dishes, and started with the Children of the Corn fritters.  They were probably the best part of my meal.  They were kind of like a cross between a falafel and a hush puppy, filled with corn and a sweet potato batter, deep fried, and coated with a garlic sauce.  I had the Sasquatch (veggie sandwich), which was decent, and made with fresh veggies, but it was a little bland.  Also, the sandwich bread was cut unevenly so that the lower half was very thin, which made the bottom half of the sandwich very soggy as the juices from the veggies seeped into the bread.  As a result I had to turn the sandwich upside down to eat it.  I had a bite of the breakfast burrito ($8), which was OK, but nothing too special.  It was basically a diner-style breakfast plate with eggs, potato, bacon, wrapped in a tortilla.  For half the price, I could get an excellent breakfast burrito, at say, Los Favoritos.  We had a little tyke in our group and she had a chicken fingers basket, which came in a huge portion, almost like an adult size portion!  All our meals came with freshly made chips, which were huge slices of potato, light and crispy.

The outdoor patio looks nice and shaded, and they allow dogs on the patio!  It's more of a regular restaurant feel outside, so if you want the creepy cool monster experience, eat indoors.  I'd say for the most part, go here for the atmosphere more than for the food, unless you want to get a few appetizers to share.

Another thing to note (Which may be self-evident), if your tyke doesn't like scary movies or haunted houses, it's perhaps best not to take him or her here for the indoor part of the restaurant.  We were seated next to the animatronic Grudge monster (A giant troll-like monster with sharp pointy teeth!) and the 5 year old in our group was really freaked out by it and kept repeating that she was scared and never wanted to eat here again. : p",0,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

There's a snack area, and the exercise facility was well stocked.

I talked with a friend who lives here.  He and his wife happened to be in the pool.  It's small but very nice and meets the needs of the residents.

Going to see the new show, For the Record: Baz which is playing across the hall from Lupo, I had the perfect opportunity to finally stop here for dinner.

I was seated promptly.  I was given a choice of inside the main part or their indoor patio style seating.  I chose inside the restaurant to avoid the noise of the people going to/from the parking garage.  

Shortly after being seated, I was brought menus and my server, Miguel, took my iced tea order and it was quickly brought to the table.  After asking a few questions about serving sizes, I ordered the heirloom tomato soup with basil to start, listed as one of the daily specials, and the lasagna verde ""della nonna"" with spinach pasta, meat sauce and béchamel.  For a side, I got an order of lemon cauliflower.

Bread service was brought with two dipping sauces.  The serving assistant asked me about freshly grated cheese and/or pepper, and I got both.  The tomato soup was outstanding.  It was rich and full of flavor.  I highly recommend this if it's on the menu.

The main course of lasagna verde was good.  The serving size was more than ample and the meat sauce was very good.  The spinach pasta gave the lasagna a slightly different taste that enhanced the dish.  The side of lemon cauliflower was very good.  Lightly browned cauliflower with more than a hint of lemon topped with some grated cheese, made for a great side dish.  This was the only thing I didn't finish in order to save room for dessert.

After looking at the items on the menu, I got the mascarpone tart which was accompanied by fresh strawberries and an oval of sorbet.  This was a refreshing end to a good meal.  

I was very pleased with the service and the one SA who brought most of my meal and a new iced tea was a very pleasant young woman with a great smile.

jgC4ktSSEEsFT6AmekbvsQ,5,2016-07-09,3,-LEerQIiMZrChzfcrffd1w,4,"In the 15 years I've lived here, I was only to this steakhouse one other time when it was still known as Primo's.  I ended up here after a failed attempt to use a coupon at another casino steakhouse because it was a holiday--July 4th--even though most everyone celebrated on Sunday and not the actual Monday holiday.  Suffice it to say that in the end, I was glad things turned out the way they did.  I quickly cancelled my other reservation and booked SC even though that turned out to be unnecessary.

I was seated immediately after being asked my preference of a booth or table.  Soon, a server was there to take my drink order and he brought me my iced tea quickly.  Then my server, Brenda, arrived to ask about drinks or questions about the menu.  She also told me a few specials for the day.  She ended by telling me the bone in ribeye was their best selling steak.  I ordered that cooked blue and I ordered the soup of the day--wild mushroom with rice--as a starter.

I was brought a smaller bread basket because of dining alone which I liked because I hate wasting food.  Even so, I had some of each of the breads everyone got just a smaller amount.  It was accompanied with two flavored butter swirls and a pat of regular butter.  One was a fruit flavored butter and the other was garlic and herb.  I preferred the garlic and herb.  I am not a fan of fruit flavored butter.

My soup was brought to the table and Brenda asked if I wanted freshly ground pepper which I got.  The soup was rich and creamy with a large amount of wild mushrooms pieces and some rice that was just enough for the small bowl.  

After a well timed interval, the steak and steak fries were brought.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was excellent.  There were some root vegetables with the steak so it wasn't devoid of vegetables.  The steak fries were enough for two people.  I would definitely skip a side when I return as it's too much for a solo diner.  

After finishing the steak and leaving most of the fries, Brenda told me the desserts available and I went with the seven layer chocolate cake which was listed as chocolate overload (if I remember correctly) on my bill.  It was chocolate cake with layers of chocolate filling all topped off with drizzled chocolate syrup.  Overload?  Maybe but quite good.  At this point, the dessert would have been a good choice for sharing.

Service was very good.  Classic service with the one server cleaning the tablecloth with a metal, u-shaped crumb picker.  He even moved the candle and salt and pepper to clean there before moving them back to where they had been.  The room was a little louder than I expected because of the talking from the bar/cocktail area.  

I repeat that I was glad my evening turned out differently than what I had planned.  Coming back to the Suncoast to try their steakhouse after so many years turned out to be a very pleasant experience.",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I had the brucee' and got a cinnamon roll to go. The brucee' is an iced toddy with coconut flavoring and heavy cream. It was a light and refreshing drink, but I did taste a hint of bitterness and some slight sour flavoring and the end of each sip. The cinnamon roll was absolutely gorgeous looking. It tasted different than your usual cinnamon roll. It tasted a little drier and wasn't totally covered in syrup or frosting. The frosting/whipped cream on the cinnamon roll had a strange chemical aftertaste to it. I did enjoy the inner, more tender part of the roll though.

The patio is picturesque and you can definitely spend a nice relaxing moment in this lovely garden area. 

One great thing about Bergies is they do offer multiple milk alternatives like coconut, almond, or soy milk. I'll definitely be back to enjoy the patio and try more drinks.",15,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I stopped in yesterday and bought two chicken pot pies--one with cheddar crust and one with habanero cheddar crust.  They were in individual boxes and the boxes were not marked so we had to guess which was which.  I din't learn this until I got home.  

They gave me a sheet with baking instructions that were very accurate.  I baked mine a little longer than they suggested but I wanted a nicely browned crust. 

After baking, I turned the pot pies over onto plates and a bit stuck to the bottom which is what I expected.  I have made my own and I know this happens.

The filling of the pot pies was good.  You can tell the freshness by the carrots alone.  When I bit into the carrot slices, I could taste the fresh taste of carrot that hasn't been frozen but is a fresh produce item.

A couple of things about my experience.  I wish I had noticed the lack of marking crust flavors on the box before I got home.  That being said, my wife and I found almost no difference in taste between the two.  The habanero just was not evident.  I also find that chicken is the only option and your flavors are determined by the crust, the chance for different tastes is very limited.  What I'd really like is a curry chicken pot pie that you could taste and it wouldn't be that much extra to do.

The pot pies were OK.  I know I'm paying for fresh ingredients and they roast their own chickens, but the cost for the size of the pie is high and maybe it has to be.  I won't need their buyers' card for getting a free one after the correct number of purchases.

Tip:  If you're going to Pie Me Over, look on the east side of Rainbow for the Firehouse Subs.  Pie Me Over is in back behind the buildings in the front of 6070 South Rainbow.",25,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We needed a break from getting subs at different places and I chose to try something new.  This location opened recently.  It makes where I live about halfway between to Panera's but I decided to try this one.

Service was great at the counter, but the wait seemed long for the take out until I realized they had a number of people eating in who had ordered just before I got there.  I brought the sandwiches home and they were very good.  My wife had their Cuban chicken panini and I had the signature Steak and white cheddar.  They were both very good.  My panini had a fair kick from the horseradish spread on the sandwich.  With the sandwiches, I opted for the small bag of chips for each of us.

The order was packaged really nice in two small cardboard boxes.  My only complaint with this is there's really no way to tell which sandwich is which unless you peel back some of the bread to reveal the contents.  Some places put a numbered sticker on their sandwiches to match the items on your receipt.  The boxes at Panera have a place you could write the name.  I sent a suggestion to HQ and the responded that they'd look into it.

I'll return and I think I'll eat in.  The dining room is very nice and there's outdoor seating for when it's cooler.",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I was hesitant to try this place given some of the early reviews, but I was hoping the new owners would make a go of it where several others have failed so we decided to give it a try tonight.  I'm so glad I did.

We were seated promptly--it was not busy--and our hostess asked if it was our first visit.  When we said yes, she explained some things about the food, the menu, and the restaurant.  She then left and got our iced teas.

I ordered the new pollo con mole which is not the chicken listed on their online menu.  They recently replace the pollo limon with the pollo mole.  My wife ordered the pork Yucatan pibil.  With the meals came a soup or salad and we both got the black bean soup.  It had an excellent flavor, but there was one thing missing.  The soup is pureed black beans and I would have liked some chopped or whole beans for texture.  Still, it was very tasty.

Our main dishes were excellent!  The mole on my chicken was rich and had great flavors.  I liked it because it wasn't heavy on the chocolate which I find with some restaurants.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her pork Yucatan.  Portions were large enough we each could have brought some home for lunch tomorrow, but I, of course, pigged out and ate all of my chicken.

For dessert, we shared--sort of--a large piece of tres leches cake.  Yelpers note: with a check in and the purchase of an entree, you get a dessert.  They also have free wifi.

Service was excellent all night.  The manager came over and spoke with us about our dinners, and our iced tea was always refilled promptly.

I love that this cafe donates a portion of their earnings on certain items towards worthy causes. I ordered the elephant bowl partially because of this (Wildlife SOS receives $1 from each bowl sold). I also had an iced lavender latte. 

The elephant bowl comes with your choice of protein and carb. I chose the walnut meat and kelp noodles. I got the order to go and took a seat to wait for my meal. 

The lavender latte was made first and was light and refreshing. It had a hint of the lavender flavor but the main component I could taste was the creamy coconut milk. They use Peixoto coffee which is great since they are an excellent local company that roasts fabulous coffee beans.

The main meal took quite a bit of time to make. I think I was waiting nearly 30 minutes but all the staff members were very apologetic about it. My bowl came in a compressed paper container in a brown paper bag. I placed the bag securely on the passenger side floor mat and I was on my way home.

While driving on the way home the curry in the bowl was so watery that it spilled out of the container (Which was on the shallow side and did not have a sauce-proof seal) all over the bag, which caused the bag to leak all over my floor mat. A day later I am still trying to air out my car because curry+ hot car is not a good fragrance in a small enclosed space in the AZ heat!

The actual bowl though was a hefty portion with lots of vegetables, walnut meat, and noodles. The curry sauce that didn't spill out onto my car was full bodied and complimented the rest of the ingredients well. The kelp noodles were intriguing as this was my first time having them. They were clear, had a springy, chewy texture and neutral flavor. 

The price was a little high, with my total being a little over $20 with tax. They do use high quality ingredients, use eco friendly packaging, and have generously sized portions to make up for the cost though.

While I enjoyed the bowl and latte, I would definitely not get any orders from here to go again. So, if I'm in the mood to dine in I'll try Pomegranate Cafe again.",26,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

My dining companion and I decided we'd like to try the crab and sweet corn soup as well.  This was brought first and even though we were sharing, we were not brought smaller, separate bowls so we just ate out of our communal soup bowl.  The soup was not exceptional in any way.  In fact, I tasted just like egg drop soup.  

We were not finished with this extra soup when servers brought out our small eats--the Peking duck and the steamed dim sum platter.  This was the first of two times when we were rushed by bringing out dishes when we weren't ready.  It didn't happen again when it was made clear that they should hold up on more main dishes.

The Peking duck was fantastic.  Small pieces of duck with a small amount of breast with crispy skin, a thin rectangular pancake, and some crispy cucumber.  The duck was topped by Tsar Nicoulai Reserve caviar.  The flavors of the caviar with the duck and the crispy cucumber was great.  The dim sum platter consisted of har gau, scallop shumai, a perch dumpling, and a black pepper duck dumpling.  The flavors were again wonderful!

The mains started arriving a bit too quickly and this is where we asked them to wait until we were finished with these first ones.  The three mains brought out were the braised whole sea bass in claypot, the crispy prawn, and the fried rice with diced abalone.  The crispy prawn was a spicy dish.  It had three green peppers with heat and it was served with dried chili and cashew nuts.  The sea bass was perfectly cooked and there were nice pieces of tofu with the bass.  The fried rice was very good!

After a break, we got the last two mains--spicy Szechuan rib-eye beef and the roasted crispy chicken.  The beef was a star of the meal.  The beef was in a rich sauce, not very spicy at all despite its name, and served on a bed on enoki mushrooms.  The chicken was fairly moist and the crispy skin was a delight.  The mushrooms with the chicken were wild mushrooms and the chicken was in an oyster sauce.  

For dessert, we got black sesame and chocolate dumplings with ginger/yuzu tea.  There were some small boba like lime balls on the dumplings and the dumplings were filled with a semi-sweet chocolate.  Wow!  What a way to end the meal.

We were each given a large Hakkasan bag--a takeaway gift--of two yuzu macarons with a chocolate cream filling.  They did make it home, but I ate them later.  The chocolate cream and the macarons were perfect!

This was a special meal and it's not a 5 star review for me this time because of the service.  With a meal like this, pacing should have been better and dishes not brought out before others were finished.  Our server, Leigh, was very knowledgable and very pleasant and she answered questions when we posed them.

I found that here yesterday.  A couple of things were missing from the shelves.  Unless you hop from one store to another you wait or buy it somewhere else.

I went with the Okinawan milk tea with white boba, light ice and 50% sweetness. The Okinawan milk tea here, in addition to their taro milk teas, uses a powdered mix that they add water to. What makes this milk tea ""Okinawan"" is the use of brown sugar instead of syrup (I read that Okinawans make a special roasted brown sugar on the island). I think the 50% sweetness level was just right for me, and I loved the earthy undertones of the drink from the tea and roasted flavor of the sugar. As for mix ins, they offer boba and various jellies. The white boba I had was a plentiful amount in my drink, with a perfect chewiness and sweetness.

While I never was a pinball pro, I have been getting enough practice at the new place that I can do relatively well--sometimes.

I am so thrilled the PH of F moved from its previous location to this one right off Trop.  It's so easy to get to and the parking is just great!  I am especially glad to see the new mix of customers.  Before it seemed like it was hardcore gamer who came.  Now I see a nice mix of men and women, tourists and locals, young and old.

I hope this place keeps doing well.  I'll be back often--well at least once a month!",8,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

It was the first Cirque show to have a story line.  While not defined especially well, it's not necessary to know the story to enjoy the show.

From the moment you walk in and see the theatre, you know you're in for a good show.  The theatre is amazing and this is but the beginning.  The acrobatics, costumes, and talent of this amazing crew blows me away each time I see the show.

I like the ""greeters"" that the show employs to see you to your seat and interact with you before the show starts.  Once seated, the sounds from the stereo speakers built into the seats is another sign of good things to come.

The hydraulics of the stage intrigues me.  I would love to have a backstage tour and see this theatre and the stage up close.  It would be very informative.

Although ""O"" is my favorite Cirque show in Las Vegas, you can't go wrong with Kà.  It is superb!",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I asked about the number of flavors for a rose cone and the person serving said they recommend no more than four.  After looking at the flavors for quite some time, I returned to the order area and said I wanted a medium with limone, coconut, and tiramisu.  While she was doing the gelato, I looked around the store, especially eyeing the macarons.


In a bit she placed a cup of gelato on the counter.  I was surprised because we'd talked about the flower shaped cone.  I took the cup and didn't complain.  I then sat at one of their high top seats and ate the gelato.  While the coconut was the best of the three flavors, the gelato itself is not creamy at all.  After having gelato in several stores in Venice and Milan this fall, I have experience with creamy, tasty gelato and Amorino just doesn't cut it.  Some of the texture was more like sherbet with ice crystals.

The price is about double what I pay at my local gelato store in Downtown Summerlin and the portion is larger here.  It would have been better to stop on the way home or else go to the chocloate company nearby that also sells ice cream.  I won't be back to Amorino.",16,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

I ordered the Porcini rubbed filet and my wife ordered the Lite filet.  My steak was 8 ounces and hers was 6 ounces.  Mine came with asparagus--3 spears and hers came with Fleming's potatoes.  I ordered mine black and blue and she ordered hers medium.  Both were cooked perfectly and were delicious.  I didn't taste any porcini from the porcini rub.

I thought there'd be more than 3 asparagus spears so I didn't order an extra side and the small amount of Fleming's potatoes was fine for my wife.  

We were started with a nice breadbasket with two kinds of flavored butters.  I didn't overdo the bread because I wanted to enjoy the steak and to have some room for dessert.  When we ordered our meal, the server informed us they needed 10 minutes to prepare the chocolate lava cake if we opted for that for dessert.

Part way through our meal, the server stopped by and asked if she should put in an order for the lava cake.  I thought it was a bit early, and should have declined at that time, but instead I trusted her knowledge.  I am a fast eater, my wife is a tortoise.

Another server brought the dessert to the table just as my wife put down her fork from her meal.  When this other person saw the table hadn't yet been cleared, she took the cake back to the kitchen and placed it on a shelf.  She then came back and cleared the table, went back to the kitchen, and returned with the dessert with its now melting ice cream.  Also, they failed the sweetener packet test miserably!

When you're paying as much for your meal as you do at Fleming's, you expect good if not excellent service.  This simply wasn't good service.  I would give this place a 2 star rating based on just the service, but the steaks were so good I raised it to three.  It was OK if not A--OK.

Comparing the other culinary restaurants I've eaten at, I'd say this one serves OK food, but the others are better in preparation and taste.  I had the salmon and ravioli appetizer, which tasted OK, albeit too salty due to the salt crust on the salmon, and the ravioli innards leaked out of the pasta into the bowl it was served in, making it look less appetizing.  The entree itself was (poisson rouge) tasted good and was well prepared, but the dessert (black forest cake) mousse was too runny.

I ordered my iced tea, got some bread, and got ready to enjoy a steak.  I only ate one piece of bread--the salted pretzel bread.  Very good.  

I started with a lobster chowder which was a lot like New England clam chowder but with lobster.  There was a good amount of lobster and the chowder was good.

Next, I had the bone in ribeye cooked blue.  The waiter said they averaged 22 to 24 ounces with the bone.  It was a nicely cooked large steak done almost perfectly.  The steak evidently wasn't pre-seasoned with any salt and pepper and I found myself putting salt on the steak.  As a side, I got the grilled corn with chipotle mayo.  That was the standout dish of the night.  The mayo and a nice spicy kick from the chipotle and when mixed into the corn, it made for a great side.

For dessert, they bring a cart to your table and show you the goods.  I went with the carrot cake.  The cake was quite large and it was very good.  The interesting thing about the carrot cake were the thin carrot shreds that were lightly candied giving a crunchy texture to the cake.  It almost seemed like the carrot shreds had been fried although they weren't.  Very nice touch.

Service was very good throughout.  My iced tea was refilled without needing to ask.  There's one suggestion I'd make.

Two of us decided to split the escargots en croute and I ordered the 10 ounce NY Strip steak done blue.  When the server came with the escargots, he cautioned us that the cast iron was very hot and we should let the escargots cool a bit so as not to burn ourselves.  As he was saying that, one of the escargots decided to ""blow off steam"" and it exploded out of the pan onto my sweater along with some garlic butter.  I took the snail and put it on my plate.  Our server removed the plate and brought me a clean one.  We all had a good laugh.  He was correct, they were very, very hot.  They're really not en croute--rather, they're topped with a piece of puff pastry.  My recommendation would be to put the pastry aside on your plate, eat the escargots, and then use the pastry to soak up the garlic butter remaining in the small wells.

When our server cleared these dishes, he told us he mentioned to the chef what happened and there would be something extra at the end of the meal.  Then he brought the salad cart and one by one made the salad according to each person's desired items and dressing.  I was a bit disappointed that bleu cheese was not an option so I opted for the ranch and he put extra bleu cheese crumbles on top.  The salad was good and it certainly is an old school way of doing salad.

In between the salad and the main course, we were brought lemon sorbet in a miniature cone as a palate cleanser.  Nice touch.  The it was on to the main course.  Garlic mashed potatoes or rice were the two choices (there was a third I didn't understand what he said) and I chose the garlic mashed.  There was a small baked tomato and some white and green asparagus.  My steak was cooked properly and was tender.  The vegetables were were good but I couldn't help but think how nice it would be if they had a baked potato cart like the salad one.  What a way to get baked potatoes.

For dessert, we were brought a chocolate mousse cake to make up for the flying snail and the standard tray of chocolate covered strawberries, and some apricots, and figs dipped in white and regular chocolate. Two of us had coffee and we were brought a dish of chocolate sticks, cinnamon sticks, whipped cream, and sugar to go with the coffee.

I did a few float sessions back when True Rest was in North Scottsdale, and I wanted to try them out again after their relocation to Tempe. 

The interior is still calm and serene, and I think the waiting area is nicer since they seem to have more space than the old location. 

When I entered, I awkwardly stood around for 5 minutes or so while the front desk attendant was in the back. It was just a minor point to the overall experience, but if this is my first time at a new place, I like to have a staff member there in the front to greet me immediately when I enter.

Just like other floats, for me at least, it took me about half the allotted time to actually get used to the idea of floating. Once I did get relaxed, it really eased any muscle pains and helped clear my mind. 

While I do enjoy flotation therapy as a way to soothe tense muscles, for me the price is cost prohibitive on a regular basis. The cost for 1 hour is roughly the same amount as a one hour massage at some places, even with a basic membership which makes the cost cheaper. For me at least, I would rather pay the same amount for someone to massage out any tense muscles. It's not to say that floatation therapy is not a valid way to relax, it really is, but for me, I feel more worth in the same amount of money spent on having a therapist focused on easing out sore muscle pains.",4,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

We were greeted by our server, who immediately tried to push alcoholic drinks on us.  We came here at lunch time on a weekday, so I wasn't really in the mood to get hammered, but we did order some aguas frescas instead (Horchata and jamaica, it was either 5 or 6 dollars).  They were a hefty price, but it was served in a very large glass.  My horchata was OK, it had decent flavor and was fairly refreshing.  The jamaica was very concentrated, so if you like a lot of tangy hibiscus flavor this is the drink for you.  

We ended up ordering a variety of tacos, but not before our server tried to push some guacamole (Around $6) on us.  We didn't really want any at first, but she insisted that it was some of the best guacamole ever and was one of the best appetizers in the house.  Soo.... we begrudgingly accepted, since we wanted to see what the hype was about.  When we got the appetizer, it was in a tiny little bowl, and covered with pomegranate seeds.  It tasted OK, and was made with fresh ingredients, but I can honestly make fresh guacamole like this at home with bigger portions for way cheaper.  

The tacos were small, like street taco size.  They came on a single small corn tortilla, and were piled high with filling.  I would have liked to see them use 2 tortillas on top of each other for stability, because I couldn't really hold the tacos in my hand to eat them.  Because they were so full, and the ingredients were a bit juicy, they would fall off while the tortilla fell apart as soon as I picked it up.  Sadly, I had to actually eat most of the tacos with a fork and knife like a gringo.  I do appreciate the generous amount of filling that was in them though, but at taquerias I've been to they typically double the street taco tortillas for this very reason.  As for the ingredients themselves, they have some unusual ones here you won't find at other Mexican restaurants, which I appreciate, but on the whole I didn't find the tacos too great taste-wise.  I had some huitlacoche tacos, a first for me, but the whole kernels of fungus-infected corn popped in my mouth as I ate them with a gooey, mushy texture on the inside, with not much flavor.  It wasn't too pleasant of a experience taste and texture wise; I felt like I was eating a bunch of pus.  Perhaps if they were chopped into smaller pieces rather than whole kernels it would have tasted better, since a big kernel on a small taco can overwhelm the whole dish.

Additionally, our server was fairly attentive, as long as there was something for her to push on us.  But, when it came time to get the check, she was no where to be seen, and we had to wait a very long time before anyone came over to our table.  

So the mixture of very pushy service combined with tacos that were memorable in all the wrong ways make me hesitant to try this restaurant again when I can get really tasty Mexican food for way cheaper at other places in the East Valley.",4,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Taking up residence where JB's Restaurant used to be years and years ago, I was very excited to see that Los Reyes de la Torta would be expanding to Tempe! This restaurant serves up Mexico City cuisine, with various meaty options, some seafood (Shrimp) dishes, and a few vegetarian meals. We ventured in today, and were greeted with the buzz and bustle of a hectic opening week. 

The interior is quite spacious, with warm, sunny colors and decor. There were a few people waiting in the front area for to-go orders, but we were seated promptly for sit-down service. Being my first time at a Los Reyes de la Torta location, I had to go with the Man vs. Food, Adam Richmond special: The famous Torta Del Rey ($9.50). I also tried some of the carne asada tacos. 

We were served chips and salsa to start with. The salsa was thin, with good flavor and spicy heat. The torta was served sliced in half, with a large serving of crinkle-cut potato chips. It was a tall tower of meat, cheese, egg, and vegetables. When eating it, I was reminded of Adam Richmond's assessment of this sandwich on his ""Best Sandwich in America"" show. When you bite into the sandwich, you taste different layers of flavor and different temperature combinations depending on which section you bite into first (The sandwich is so big it's very hard to actually bite into all the layers at one time). The lower layer consists of a smattering of slow cooked beans and the roasted and breaded meats- the tastiest layer in my opinion! The middle section holds the cheese, scrambled egg, chorizo, and cured meats (Ham and hot dog). While I liked the ham and chorizo in the sandwich, the hot dog tended to overpower the other meats in the torta. The upper layer was the ""cool"" layer, consisting of sliced avocado and tomato. I enjoyed the combination of cool vegetables with grilled meat. However, I would have liked more of the cool ingredients to balance out all the hot ingredients. The torta itself was nicely grilled, with delicious telera bread.

The carne asada tacos were like street tacos. They had a good amount of chopped meat, cilantro, and onion on it, with some lime wedges to add more citrus flavor.

For beverages, they have a wide array of drinks to choose from (All non-alcoholic). I tried the horchata ($4), which was a little watery, but tasted freshly made and was pretty refreshing overall.

While I'm glad I tried the Torta Del Rey, it's a hefty meal. I'd definitely be interested in trying out more items from this restaurant!",16,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Smoke was coming out from the sides of the bowl from a couple of pieces of dry ice concealed in the lower section.  The bowl was sitting on a plate that had apples all over it.  The smoking bowl and the apple plate went with the restaurant's fall theme.  It was very pleasing to the eye and to the palate.

Seating was comfortable but the leg room was a little less than I had expected.  Also, the seats are of a vinyl quality which made them a little difficult on the legs because I was wearing shorts.

We ate here with some friends that had lived in Vegas and said this was one of the best places for dim sum. We arrived here around noon, and there was a bit of a wait, since there is limited space in the restaurant, especially for large parties of more than 4. Ignoring our PANGs of hunger, we waited patiently. It probably took us about 20-30 minutes to get seated. 

While the selection is more limited than other dim sum restaurants, they do you have your standard dim sum items like shu mai, sticky rice in lotus leaf, fried taro cake, chicken feet, spare ribs, congee, and bao. 

The items were hot, and fresh tasting. The carts went by at a decent rate, but we were warned that you should get any items you wanted while the cart was there, since you might not see that cart again. Prices were a bit high compared to other restaurants I've eaten at (3-4 dollars per item average), but that was to be expected for dim sum in a Vegas casino.

Service was a bit spotty, but to be expected since the restaurant was filled to capacity with hungry diners. Waiters were buzzing back and forth, like a ball in a PONG game, filling water, getting more tea, and getting people's checks.

So if you're hungry for dim sum, this restaurant is a good choice. If you are with a larger party though, it helps to come here before noon when it's less crowded.",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

I ordered a Jinya bun--pork chasu with cucumber, sauce, and Jinya's kewpie mayo on a bao bun.  The sandwich was good.  I also got the smallest order--5 pieces--of crispy chicken.  What a nice breading for these chicken pieces.  Take care to let them cool a bit because the chicken is fiercely hot inside when first served.  Finally, I had asked the server if I could get a half order of takoyaki and she said they don't normally do it but she'd order it for me.  Instead of 6 pieces, I got 3 wonderfully flavored octopus rounds with a wonderful sauce.  (Thanks for the heads up, Philip!)  Rounding out the meal, I got the panna cotta for dessert.  The graham cracker squares gave a good texture to the panna cotta.  It was a good, light choice to end the meal.

We came here with a Groupon and were pleasantly surprised by the quality, portions, and atmosphere of this cute little Greek eatery.

Our Groupon included 2 pitas and 2 fountain drinks. We decided on the Mediterranean chicken and a gyro picado. Each pita comes with a side (Fries, soup, salad, or rice). We chose rice and soup as ours.

The gyro meat was tender, with well balanced flavors in the pita itself. There was a lot of meat and veggies inside, which made the pita a great deal since it also included a side. I loved that they had a unique twist on the classic gyro pita, adding jalapeno to the mix to add some spicy kick. The lentil soup I had was quite good. It had the right amount of spice, and was filling and hearty. The Mediterranean chicken pita was also very good, with tender, juicy chunks of chicken. The pitas themselves were soft, slightly grilled, and came with the option of regular or wheat. I tried both types, and they were both equally good. As for the side of rice, it was well seasoned, with a nice fluffy texture.

Fountain drinks are free-range, and there's also a tea station with several options of tea available. Sodas are Coca-Cola brand products. 

The atmosphere had a nice modern feel, very unlike other Greek places I've been to where they have a slightly outdated look, accentuated by those cheesy ""GYROS"" posters that look like they're from the '70s and '80s, of a young lady brandishing a gyro.

For dessert, the ""Black and Tan"" pudding was made of Dutch chocolate and butterscotch pudding and served with salted caramel corn.  The combination of salt with the pudding was excellent.

I had a reservation for 5 PM, unneeded as it turned out.  I looked at the menu while my server, Tracy, brought my iced tea.  For a starter, I ordered the sesame tuna.  It was  5 pieces of tuna, previously seared and arranged on a bed of seaweed salad with wasabi cream and pickled ginger topping the salad.  The tuna was dry.  It was just stored too long before being used.  The plating was certainly nice but the dryness was very noticeable.

After browsing through the menu, I decided on the meatball panini. The order came out quickly, but I was surprised to see that the sandwich was placed in a thin, folded over pita-like bread rather than a thicker panini bread. Since it was only folded over and thin it was hard to eat it without the meatballs falling out of the sandwich. Additionally, the sandwich came with a marinara dipping sauce. The sauce itself was superb but any attempts to dip the sandwich in the sauce also resulted in the meatballs rolling out of the sandwich. 

The actual ingredients were good though. The meatballs were hearty with good flavor, and the thin bread was nicely toasted.

If I eat here again I probably won't be getting the meatball panini, but perhaps another lunch item will be less unwieldy to eat!",3,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

xz_blZ7eume1SyOWPk4xKw,9,2011-10-23,4,j_MPG3RK_v5BCUx2YdfAnQ,5,"This is one of my favorite hikes. It's moderately strenuous at just over 6 miles. I refer to it as a triple treat hike because there are three distinct features to see on this hike.

To get to the trailhead, take the new O'Callaghan-Tillman Memorial Bridge near Hoover Dam and go south in Arizona to Mile Marker 4 on US 93. There is a left turn lane that crosses the northbound lanes and heads to a new blacktop road that goes up a hill and to a new large parking area. For those familiar with the Arizona Hot Springs hike, this is the new parking for that hike, too, as the new road has closed the old parking area.

From the parking lot, head downhill into the wash.  To get into the wash, follow the use trail that begins just past the interpretive markers at the end of the parking lot.  After going down this path from the parking lot, make sure you go under the double set of bridges and follow the wash west for about 9/10 of a mile. This is where you make a right turn and head north out of this wash. There is a small cairn along the wash that is easy to miss. Hike up a small hill and you'll be in a small canyon that heads north. You pick up the trail easily here, and follow it for about 1/4 mile. Along the way, you'll find a very large cairn with a wooden stake. After this cairn, as you travel north, pay attention because the trail will leave this wash and head up a hill to an old mining road. You can see the stacked stones from when it was a road. 

At this road, turn left and follow the road. It eventually makes a curve near an old mine prospect which didn't get dug very much. There's another set of nice stonework along the road as you go up the hill. Continue along the road and you'll start to see debris from the mining that took place at a nearby manganese mine. When you crest the hill and come around a curve, on a hill in front of you, there's an ore car laying on the side of the hill. The old manganese mine is in the wash below this car on the other side of the ridge.

Keep to the left at any trails you see. These spider trails just go to overlooks and a couple are dangerous, because a fall could land you 50 feet below in the old mine. The trail to the left goes over some jagged rock and then starts down the other side. Soon you come to a fork in the trail. If you want to investigate the mine (this is one I will tell you is safe to enter), it will add about 1/2 mile to your total hike. There are some rails in the dirt floor of the mine and several air holes are cut in the sturdy rock. To continue the hike, return to the fork and turn right. The mine is treat #1.

The left fork continues down the hill and enters the wash. Periodically it will leave the wash and then come back in. At about two miles from the trailhead, or about 2.5 miles if you went to the mine, the trail comes out of the wash and heads west up a hill to a saddle. In front of you, Liberty Bell Arch can be seen. The best photos come from the south but feel free to take all you want wherever you are on the hike. At the saddle, make a left turn, and head southwest following the trail. You're going up another hill until you're almost in line with the arch. Near the arch, the trail cuts south and as you pass the arch and then look back, this is where you get the best view of the result of a natural erosion process. This is treat #2.

Continue following the trail south. You hike past a field that has some enormous boulders that are amazing to see. At one time, they broke off the hill above and rolled here. The trail is very evident here as it is well traveled. The footing can be bad because the rocks can be sharp. Take care as you hike along.

Eventually, you'll go around the side of a hill and the view of Liberty Bell Arch is gone until you return. From here, there are about 4 ridges to go up and over. Stop as needed and get your breath. Make sure you've brought enough water with you--you should be using a Camelbak for a hike like this. When you get to the last ridge, you come up on a mesa and below you to your left is treat #3, a view of the Colorado River about 1,000 feet below as it winds toward Willow Beach in Arizona. 

When you arrive on the mesa, the trail goes near the edge so you can get great views of the Colorado. It is truly beautiful up here. Explore the mesa, look north and see the bypass bridge, and stop and sit on one of the rocks for a snack. When you're done enjoying the mesa, retrace your steps. THe toughest part now will be coming back up the wash to the car from the Liberty Bell Arch turnoff. It always seems so tough to get that last mile done with gravel under foot.

I have done this hike about 7 times, twice from the new trailhead, and it truly is a treat! I have posted on EveryTrail the explanation and GPS coordinates from my last hike. We passed the turnoff to Liberty Bell, so don't follow me there but turn where the waypoint is. The link is http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=904927

It was made in a speedy amount of time and was very filling. The bun was soft and a bit oily, the bacon crisp, and there were large chunks of avocado in the filling. The total was around $8 which is slightly cheaper and had more substance than similar offerings at other restaurants here.

For our breakfasts, I had the lemon ricotta pancakes with sautéed apples.  The pancakes very light and they had just enough of lemon flavor with the ricotta so as not to be too lemony.  I used some syrup.  I think if I have this again, I might get the cream cheese icing they use with the red velvet pancakes.  it would be a nice combination.

My wife had a spinach omelette with cheddar cheese.  They offer hash browns or fruit and she got the fruit.  A very nice cup of fresh fruit.  They also give you a choice of toast or bagel.  Having a bagel instead of toast is not a common choice.  She opted for wheat toast.

We enjoyed everything very much.  Norm brought the orders to the table and chatted with us for awhile.  He asked for any suggestions, comments, or complaints.  They have instituted a comment card that's brought with your check.  It's optional, but if you fill it out, they stamp it for a discounted car wash at Fabulous Freddy's - $3 off.

I have been to Wynn Las Vegas several times for shows and to eat at the buffet.  The casino is very nice and roomy.  I like the wide aisles which generally allow you to navigate around photo taking tourists who are in a cloud.

I stopped in to see the newer carousel and hot air ballon and was disappointed to find they were artificial flowers instead of real ones.  I was looking closely and a security person asked me if he could help.  When I mentioned the artificial flowers, he confirmed I was correct.

I do like to stop and see the two Jeff Koons sculptures Wynn has purchased.  But I wonder if paying for two guards for each (maybe two only depending on time of day) is worth the cost as opposed to having some fresh flowers in his floral displays.  I do like Koons.

Nanay's serves stick-to-your-ribs, hearty, comforting food, perfect for a chilly day! We came here around 11 AM for lunch and were the only customers here. As we left a few more people trickled in.

There were a lot of dishes to choose from, with a variety of meat (Chicken, pork, or beef). There was one section off to the side that had some crispy fish. I got a 3 item combination ($9.50) which included a plate of 2 scoops of rice. On the menu board it said soup was included so I asked which soup was part of the meal. The person helping us out said she could give me a little bowl of broth but not the other contents of the soup (Which included some greens and pork) so I'm not sure if soup is actually still part of the combo deal since my friend didn't get any extra soup for her 3 combination meal.

Each dish I had was very flavorful. I especially enjoyed the pork with coconut milk and green beans. Unfortunately I don't know the name of it but it was tasty! The kare kare and dinuguan I also had were enjoyable. My friend's chicken dishes were also quite good and the broth was lovely.

Drinks are by the can or bottle and include bottled water, Snapple, and various sodas. There is also a free-range container of iced water to serve yourself.

Service was good and the person helping us out was warm and friendly. When we entered the restaurant though the music (Tuned to a mix of ""easy listening"" artists like Barry Manilow) was cranked really high up to dance club level volume! They did turn it down a bit once I asked :)

6zry3kyGHiplbQ4rdqxbaQ,8,2010-12-28,2,IsKxL0ZBFHfCMOUaouSY2Q,5,"This is a difficult five mile round trip hike within the Scenic Drive at Red Rock Canyon.  There is a 2,000 foot elevation gain over 2.5 miles.  This hike should only be attempted by experienced hikers.  You need hiking boots and a backpack with water and perhaps a snack or some protein bars.  All that being said, the payoff of the view when you get to the peak is worth the work and pain of getting there.

The trailhead is at the Sandstone Quarry parking area, the 3rd parking area along the Scenic Drive.  From the west end of the parking lot, walk past the red and white sandstone that was left when the quarry closed in 1913, I think.  There's evidence of their activity, and there are some interpretive markers to explain how they cut the stone and why they went bankrupt.

The trail goes through a wash and then continues west.  You come to a junction.  To the right is the Calico Tanks trail.  You need to go straight.  Both trails are marked at the junction, about the last trail marker for Turtlehead.  From then you start gaining elevation, slowly at first, and then more extreme.

Eventually you reach the end of the sandstone formation and the trail cuts north.  Now the going gets tougher.  There are switchbacks to help with the elevation gain.  In places, the gravel is quite loose--an excellent reason for wearing hiking boots.

At this point, take a look up to the saddle to the left of Turtlehead.  That's your first goal.  There are two large boulders near the saddle and you should aim for them.  There are a number of spider trails, but if you stay to the middle trails or slightly right, and keep going up, you're doing the right thing.  The area gets very steep in places.  The first time I hiked this, I stopped to catch my breath, and I started sliding backwards standing still.  I never thought I'd make it, but I pressed on after a break.

Eventually, you reach the saddle, and you have payoff number one.  The view into Brownstone Canyon is simply awesome.  The sandstone colors are truly beautiful and you feel almost on top of the world.  But you're not--that's about to come.  At the saddle, the trail goes right.  This is the route up the back slope of Turtlehead that leads to the summit.  Just like coming up the chute to the saddle, there are a number of trails that hikers have made.  If you stay to the right, nearer to the edge, you will be taking the faster route, but I think it's a bit harder.

Finally, you get to the summit and you are on top of your world.  The 360 degree view is tremendous.  Far off, you can see the Las Vegas Strip, and as you pivot, you look across Red Rock Canyon and see the tiny Scenic Drive.  You can also see all the washes that run through the NCA.  To the west, you have views of the Spring Mountains and Griffith Peak at Mount Charleston.  Take the time to relax, sign the log book in an ammo box in some rocks near the highest point, have a snack, and take lots of photos.  The peak is very large, so there's plenty of room there.

To get back to the car, go down one of the trails from the summit keeping your eye out for those  large boulders near the saddle.  When you get there, you'll see where the trail descends.  Take the downward part of the hike easy.  This is very difficult, and sliding and falling is a distinct possibility.  At the base of the chute, start breathing again, and get ready to have a big smile because you're almost done with your conquering of Turtlehead.  Just over a mile to go the the parking area!  Congratulations!!

The whole place including this room are very dark with mirrors most notably running the length of the ceiling.

My server brought a menu and a water glass was filled.  The server stopped by again and asked about drinks and I ordered my usual iced tea which was soon brought.  My dinner consisted of three tapas plates--octopus ceviche with grapefruit and pickled jalapeño, shrimp risotto with a tomato fondue and arugula, and ricotta gnocchi with braised short rib and pea purée.  For dessert, I got the chocolate makeout--a warm chocolate fondant with salted caramel cream, peanut brittle, and caramel sauce.

The octopus ceviche was very good.  The dish had a good citrus flavor from the grapefruit and the pickled jalapeños added a good contrast.  Served with the dish was a small amount of corn chips which I ate along with the octopus.

The shrimp risotto was OK.  There was nothing special about the dish.  The shrimp were large but the dish as a whole lacked any wow factor to make the whole standout.   The shrimp were also a bit chewy.

Last was the ricotta gnocchi with braised short rib and pea purée.  I really liked this dish. The short rib was very tasty as opposed to the bland ricotta gnocchi and there was no discernible taste of the pea purée at all.  Still, I liked the flavor of the short rib and the softness of the gnocchi made a good fit.

Dessert was the chocolate makeout--almost a chocolate lava cake but mercifully not another rendition of this ubiquitous dessert.  The chocolate fondant was rich and I could have piped the salted caramel cream directly into my mouth.  The peanut brittle and small amount of caramel sauce added texture and flavor to the dessert.

Service was varied.  The iced tea was brought with no sugar or other sweeteners.  When the server came by one time, he stopped and then asked if I  had wanted any sugar.  I asked for some artificial sweetener which he never brought.  After he went by a few times, I stopped a busser and asked him and I had a container of sweeteners in no time at all.

When it came time for dessert, a different server stopped by and asked me if I wanted dessert.  I ordered from her.  After dinner, the original server brought my check and took payment.

The server didn't ask if I needed anything explained from the menu nor did he mention more than one off menu special.  The other server mention a couple of them to the tab;e next to me and asked them if they had been to the restaurant before.  She then went on to describe some of the dishes and told the people if there were any other questions to ask her.  I think maybe she should have been with me the whole time.

I had a Restaurant.com certificate and I made a reservation as per the certificate and came out tonight for dinner.  I was going to eat inside, but the patio was so inviting I decided to eat out.  It was lovely.  There's something that doesn't seem quite right about being in the middle of the desert eating next to a lake with a large boat.

Now on to the food.  I ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer.  Wonderful!  The cakes had lots of real crab meat and not just shredded pieces.  The cakes are coated with panko crumbs and served with a curry and coconut sauce.  Also, hot rolls were brought out before I got the appetizer and there was a scoop of butter and a scoop of tapenade.

The main course was an 8 ounce filet cooked extra rare and topped with a  chimichurri sauce and served with garlic mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables.  The filet was cooked the way I like it--barely--and the potatoes and vegetables were great.  I finished the last bit of mashed potatoes with some of the tapenade.  Excellent!

Dessert?  Why certainly.   I had checked the menu online and had decided on the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.  My server, Stephanie, asked me about dessert and said, ""I highly recommend the Godiva cheesecake.""  She read my mind.  It was fantastic!

Speaking of Stephanie, service was excellent.  No one went by without helping.  Different servers removed a dirty dish, another refilled my iced tea, and others asked if I needed anything.  Just the kind of service everyone appreciates.

It had been probably years since I last ate here. A trip to the Washington DC area last year where Ethiopian restaurants are plentiful with delicious food, as well as the lovely Chris H.'s suggestion prompted me to try Cafe Lalibela again.

The menu has a wide variety of meat and vegetable dishes, with various options for combination platters. I highly recommend getting some kind of combination, and sharing a larger combination is even better because you get to experience more of the dishes that way. This time we shared a vegan combination platter and the Lalibela mixed meat/vegetable platter. In general I enjoyed each entree but my particular favorites were the tikil gomen (cabbage, carrot, and potato curry) and the fosolia (green beans and carrot). 

We ordered one of each dessert to pass around and share. The teff cake was rich and moist but slightly granular tasting. The mousse was very light with a whipped chocolate flavor. The tres leches cake was wonderful with the milk-soaked lightly sweet spongy cake, and the tiramisu was a creamy coffee delight.

Service was OK. Although they had written the wrong number of people on our reservation it was easily remedied. As the restaurant got busier it did get harder to obtain refills on drinks though.

I was excited to hear that Chou's expanded their locations, opening up a second restaurant in Tempe. The restaurant seems more spacious and has better ambiance than the Chandler location, with more tables and decor.

We browsed through the menu and decided on the xiao long bao, eggplant with minced pork in garlic sauce, and mapo tofu. The eggplant and tofu came out first. The eggplant was tender with a slightly crisp outer layer from frying with a concentrated brown garlic sauce. The mapo tofu was light on ground meat, but had very fresh tasting tofu and a tongue numbing, flavorful sauce with Sichuan peppercorns. The xiao long bao came out piping hot, a pretty good rendition of this dish, holding the requisite savory broth hidden inside the small dumplings. 

Service was good and we were checked up on as needed. Our server spoke both fluent English and Mandarin Chinese. 

Overall 4.5/5. I'll definitely be back!",13,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

Yesterday on the way back from hiking with Yelp friends at Mount Charleston, we did a quick off/on the freeway to go to Retro bakery.  I've seen the reviews, but since it's a drive from where I live, I never went here.  That will change.

I bought a box of four, and it was difficult picking the flavors I wanted because they all looked so good.  I ended up with; 1) red carpet with an almond butter cream frosting on a red velvet like cake; 2) Coffee and doughnut with a frosting of sugar doughnut-like frosting and a dollop of coffee flavored frosting; 3) Cookies and cream; and 4) Chocolate fountain with chocolate cake and chocolate buttercream frosting and dipped in chocolate ganache.

We tried the Coffee and doughnut and the Chocolate fountain yesterday and will polish off the other two tonight.  I think some people might think the frosting is too sweet, but I'm such a sour person, sweet is always good!

I forgot to add that the staff was very friendly and quite helpful!

After watching a lovely show at The Orpheum, we were feeling quite peckish, so we headed over to partake in the discounted delectables that The Arrogant Butcher had to offer.  I also just wanted to eat here because I dig the name Arrogant Butcher. From 3-6 PM they offer appetizers such as pretzels with cheese fondue ($5), fried shrimp with shishito peppers ($8), and artichoke hummus ($8).  They also have a decent selection of mixed drinks, wine, and beer at a reasonable price for happy hour.  We indulged in all the appetizers described above, and left with full and satisfied stomachs.

The pretzels came in a big basket, and are pretty much like the pretzels you will find at Culinary Dropout.  They are fairly large, doughy nuggets, and go well with the cheese fondue (It tasted like some type of cheddar concoction). The fondue was good, but a little grainy.  The shrimp were nicely cooked, and had a nice tender texture to go with the crunch of the light batter.  The shishito peppers were good as well, and were mild in heat.  The hummus was a very nice presentation, and had a wonderful array of textures and flavors, from the smooth, almost creamy hummus, to the pieces of artichoke, olive, tomato, and sweet red pepper.  The pita bread that was served with it was grilled, with a pillowy center.

XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg,4,2012-02-28,1,Um-t-6yoq30S1X1HQlurOQ,4,"Review is for Spring 2012 Restaurant Week dinner:

I've been waiting awhile to try Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill and Restaurant Week seemed like the time to do it.  The appetizer and main course are on the regular menu.  Dessert is not listed on their website menu so this was a good sampler of the real thing at Mesa Grill.

On being seated, I was given the regular menu, a wine and cocktail menu, and the Restaurant Week menu.  My server, Rodil, was great with ordering and everything thereafter.  I ordered an iced tea and it was brought quickly followed by bread basket with a nice selection--two slices of jalapeño bread with a nice kick, a corn muffin, and two slices of raisin bread.  Accompanying the bread was softened butter.  I also tried the corn muffin.  It was good but a little dry.  The best thing about the muffin was the number of corn bits baked into it.  Still the jalapeño bread was my favorite.

For the first course, I ordered the blue corn pancake.  It was filled with duck and had a habanero chile-star anise sauce.  Rodil had alerted me that this wasn't spicy, but for a starter, I didn't care.

The second course was Flay's signature dish, New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with a bourbon-ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamal which had a round of crushed pecan butter placed into the sweet potato/corn mixture to add liquid.  The pork was tender and cooked perfectly.  The spices rubbed on the pork gave it some great flavor and zing, and the ancho chile sauce was excellent--dark, rich, and very flavorful.  Rodil noticed that I was almost snorting the sauce and he asked if I wanted more, the pusher.  He brought a small round dish with extra ancho sauce.  I dipped my tenderloin in the sauce with abandon and joy!  The tamal was superb.  What an interesting twist on the common tamal.

My choice for dessert was Chocolate Bread Pudding with toasted bourbon marshmallow squares and graham cracker crisps on top.  The chocolate was semi-sweet and this was a fine ending to the meal.  It wasn't as sweet as most desserts and it complimented the flavors from the pork.

I had the best seat in the house in my mind.  I was near the back of the restaurant seated along a railing where I could watch the chefs do their work.  I had a good view of the grill where the steaks were cooked, and I could see into the salad/dessert preparation area.  Right near me was the staging area where two people oversaw the distribution of food.  When an order came in, they each got a copy and they both checked to see things were correct.  The person working on the outside nearest me wiped the dishes to remove any stray food so presentation was perfect.

I enjoyed the meal.  I was not hurried but things moved along at a good pace.  All the staff was efficient and pleasant.  This was a great meal to kick off the Spring 2012 Restaurant Week and I will be back!",3,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

This dinner consisted of 6 courses done by different chefs.  The first, the amuse, was by Eduardo Saavedra of MTO Café.  It was two fried California gold oysters with seaweed kimchi and Asian pear mignonette.  

The second course, salad, was by Daniel Ontiveros of the closed Comme Ça.  It was Gochujang pig ear terrine and white kimchi salad, pickled daikon, and cilantro.

Course three, soup, was by Johnny Church of MTO.  was seared abalnoe mushroom hot pot with ""mirepoux.""

Course 4, appetizer, was by Brian Howard, Chef/Owner of Grazing Pig Food Group, and consisted of heritage pork tartare tenders and heart, soju pickled bae, and Carolin rice craklin.

Course 5, by Brian Lhee, Executive Chef of Yusho Las Vegas, was Korean hsort rib with tofu cavatelli, sesame leaves, and crispy anchovies.

Dessert, Course 6, was by Ashley Traeger and Meilani Marriott of Hapa Sweeters (coming soon to Las Vegas).  The did two small desserts--Spring green tea mini tart and a matcha green tea panna cotta.

After the meal, the chefs were introduced and each one spoke briefly.

I had a seat at the counter facing the espresso machine and it was perfect.  I got to watch the construction of the dishes and it was great fun watching them do their thing.  

Service was excellent, the food was great, and it was a fine evening of supper of a different kind.   Prix fixe is $65 and a reservation is a must.

Our group came here after an Unofficial Yelp Event at Red Rock Canyon.  They set up for 10 because we weren't sure how many were coming.  We ended up with 8 so the set up was perfect.

Drink orders were taken quickly.  We must have looked like we could use rehydration after the 4.5 mile hike.  Refills were always quick to come.  My iced tea was refilled 3 times and our server brought two of us a glass with extra ice as our ice started melting.

For food, I ordered from their lunch pick two menu.  I got the turkey club with a bowl of clam chowder.  The club sandwich was good.  Each quarter had a piece of avocado which added to the flavor.  There were a lot of clams in the chowder.  It was enjoyable also.

The service.  Tina, our server, was simply top notch at what she does and that's the reason for the 4th star.  She was always around refilling drinks, checking on whether or not someone needed anything, and generally keeping the best care for us she could.  She also had an instinct of some kind such that she gave us individual checks without asking if it was one check or separate.  That's SERVICE!

After a movie, I walked the short distance to the Earl.  It was mid-afternoon and they weren't very busy.  I ordered the holiday turkey sandwich that I had once before and a regular drink.  They gave me a buzzer and I went to the patio where there was a two top table available.

In a short time, the buzzer went off and I retrieved my sandwich from inside.  It was nice and warm and just the thing I wanted--turkey, dressing, and cranberry sauce.  I got an iced tea with the sandwich.

When it's cold in winter or very hot in the summer, I'm not sure the patio is much of an option.  It is a small shop as others have noted with limited seating along the front window inside.  I suppose you could do take out but that sort of negates the idea of getting a warm sandwich.

We browsed through the store today and saw items such as rice cookers, beauty goods, and various containers in the non-food section. I was excited to see a certain brand of kimchi one can usually only procure in CA sold here (Thanks to Adam A. for gifting me with that delicious first jar, brought in from Cali!). The banchan selection was amazing. It looked so fresh and there were types of banchan I've never seen before until I ventured inside the store. 

In addition to Korean foods, they also have a smattering of Japanese, Chinese, and Hawaiian food items dispersed throughout the different aisles. 

The fresh produce selection was decent, not as wide of a variety as say the International Market but they did have specific Korean vegetables sold here that I have not really seen before until now. 

The meat section had very fresh beef and pork cuts, as well as prepackaged cuts in both the refrigerated area and in the freezer. If you are looking for hot pot meat or meat for Korean bbq this is a good place to go.

Prices were comparable to other Asian grocery stores in the East Valley.

Service was so friendly. The owner(?) (Manager?) was here who greeted us kindly when we walked in, and thanked us for our patronage after we checked out. He also mentioned that this weekend (April 28-30) they are celebrating their grand opening with Korean food (Including jap chae. Mmm!) and giveaways.

The menu consists of various burgers, fries, hot dogs, and various shakes. Each menu item has the caloric count on it so you know exactly how much you are cheating on your diet :). I tried some of the chick 'n shack, had a 'shroom burger, and had a black and white shake. 

The chicken sandwich was delicious, with crispy and tender meat, soft potato bun, with toppings that went well with each other. The 'shroom burger had a batter that was light and crispy, with a well seasoned portobello mushroom. While overall it was a good tasting vegetarian burger, I didn't really like the gooey cheese that went with it. 

The burgers themselves are a bit small but the quality of the ingredients make up for it.

The shake was a perfect thickness, easy to sip through a straw, with rich chocolate and vanilla flavor.

I called and we made arrangements for the next week as this was not an emergency repair.  Daniel came early, diagnosed the problem, told me three options--one of which would have cost him because I could fix it myself.  I opted to have him replace the light with a new LED one.

He told me what to ask for at the big box hardware place and I chose the light in my photo.  Daniel came back the next week--again early (when have you heard that about service people)--and installed the new light.  Now my laundry room is filled with wonderful light and it's a pleasure to have it there.

I was there early, about 11;15, and I was the first person in the restaurant.   There soon were several other customers.  It's a very large room with lots of tables laid out well and the buffet is a large area opposite the entrance.

With a check in on Yelp, you get either a mango lassi or a soda free.  It's a good deal for merely checking in.

I ordered garlic naan and then headed to the buffet.  The naan was good but I wish it had more of a garlic flavor.  For the first plate, I had chicken Biryani, a couple vegetable pakoras, a vegetable samosa, a piece of tandoori chicken, some chili chicken, soya badi, and some saag paneer.  Everything I had was very good and I noticed that almost all dishes had a spiciness that I liked.  Of these, the weakest dishes was the saag paneer.  The crust of the samosa was flaky and the filling was very good.  The soya badi was quite good.

For my second plate, I had squash, Navratan korma, chicken curry, and chana masala.  All of these were very good save the squash which was a little nondescript.  I also tried some of their raita which was good.  The chicken curry didn't have very much of a curry flavor but when the juices from the chana masala mixed with the curry juice, it became much better.

Finally, I went back and got one idli and put a small amount of tamarind chutney on it.  It had a soft texture and was good.  I was a but disappointed that they had no dhokla.  I had read Christopher S.' review and I was interested in trying something different.

Overall, this is a very solid buffet and moves to the top tier of Indian restaurants.  The price is now $10.99 but that's still very good considering the wide choice you have with their large buffet.

Service was very good!  Several times, someone stopped by to see how things were.  A woman stopped once and asked me if it was too spicy so they know that they spice their foods.  Plates were cleared before I came back each time.

When I left for the gym this morning, the garage door made a different sound when it got to the bottom.  When I came back home, I realized why.  It just didn't shut, it banged shut because of a broken spring and one cable that snapped, too!

I was going to wait until my neighbors were up before calling to see who they had do their door when it happened to them earlier this year and then I realized--Yelp--why wait to call anyone.  I look on Yelp for garage repair services and up came a bunch of different companies but only one had many entries with mostly 5 stars.  

I called and Jeff answered the phone promptly.  I explained about the cable (at that time I hadn't noticed the spring) and he said he'd have someone here by 11 AM.  (I told Jeff how I found his company and he was appreciative of Yelp).  At about 10:20, I got a call from Travis who said he was on his way.  He arrived just before 11, went to the garage with me, and quickly diagnosed the problems.

Within a very reasonable time frame, the spring was replaced with double springs which is what the door should have had in the first place, two new cables were installed on each side, and the cheap plastic wheels were replaced with rollers with ball bearings.  The price was excellent for the work that needed to be done.

Travis was polite, pleasant, and very professional.  He knows his stuff.  The garage door is so much more quiet now than it's been in the 11 years I've lived here.  

If you need garage door repair, you need to call Jeff at Dreikosen.  It's a local firm and they are very, very good and deserving of the 5 star rating!",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Since it was restaurant week we decided to give this place a try. It's been a few years since I had Brazilian food so I was looking forward to a food reunion!

The restaurant itself has a lovely serene patio that is dog friendly with an equally pleasing interior. On weekends they play live music and they have a happy hour from 3-6 (Currently Tuesday-Saturday, Monday-Saturday after June 13) that includes discounted drinks, appetizers, and sandwiches. We got here at 5:30 just in time to get a discounted caipirinha ($7) and bolinho de bacalhau ($5). The caipirinha was excellent, with bold lime flavors, strong but smooth cachaca liquor, and the perfect amount of sweet and tart flavor. I had never had cachaca 61, but it is a lot better and smoother tasting than cachaca 51 which is more readily available in the U.S.

In addition to the bolinho de bacalhau (Salt cod fritters), our party ordered other appetizers as well to share as they ordered from the restaurant week menu ($33 for four courses). They included mandioca frita (Fried yucca), pasteis (Savory turnovers), and pao de queijo (Cheese bread). My favorites were the pasteis and the bacalhau. The pasteis was very similar to an empanada, with a perfect crisp flaky crust and well seasoned beef. The bacalhau was a great mix of lightly crisp breading with salt cod and potato.

For entrees, we ordered the feijoada for two ($21), and tried a few dishes others ordered from the restaurant week menu. I loved the feijoada, it is probably my favorite dish out of all the ones I tried. It was a simple black bean stew, but it packed a lot of depth and nuanced flavor from the combination of beans, seasonings, pork and beef. It was served with a diverse spread of chopped marinated peppers, farofa grain, orange slices, shredded (Collard?) greens, and white rice. The combination of all the flavors together was truly wonderful. 

Service was superb. Our server was friendly and humorous. A manager (Or the owner?) stopped by to chat which we appreciated.

The calamari was quite good, a delightful and tender portion of seafood with lightly crisp batter. It was a generous amount and just right for two. The veggie pizza was filled to the brim with vegetables and rich creamy house-made mozzarella but the thing I loved the most about the pizza was the perfect balance of crisp, light crust with a soft chewiness when you bit into it. The only slight negative I had was that it was slightly oversauced which made it hard to taste the other ingredients in the pizza. Note that each pizza you order is the same size, 14"", so you can plan your meal accordingly.

We ended our meal with gelato and what was touted as affogato but when I got my dessert it was basically a brownie a la mode with espresso poured on top. Now, technically affogato means ""drowned"" in Italian, so sure, this dessert was indeed ""drowned"" in espresso, but usually an affogato is a shot or two of espresso in a cup with gelato mixed into it. This was more like an ""upside down affogato"" I suppose :). The dessert was a large portion but the brownie was a bit too sweet for me and it was a little hard to incorporate the espresso into it since it was straight liquid espresso and not a sauce you can easily scoop with the ice cream and brownie. 

Service was good and we were checked on as needed.

Since I take my xTerra off road fairly often, he's always on the look out to see that I have the 4 wheel drive in top working order.

I had a warranty fix today and that was accomplished quickly!  They also installed new hatch stays.  I had worn the other ones out and I was tired of hitting my damn head right into the back of the hatch.  As many times as I hit my head, I either should have more sense knocked into me, or I have lost some like a punch drunk boxer.

The waiting area is quite nice.  There are high round tables away from the TV area if you want to read or listen to your iPod.  They have 3 terminals that you can use to check email and surf - even do a late Yelp review if your so inclined.  I read the LA Times and then played games on my iPhone and checked email.

I made a reservation on OpenTable and in the comments I requested seating in the Swan Court.  When I arrived, there was a large group near that area.  I was seated in the main dining room with a wonderful view of the wine tower.

Shortly after being seated, the assistant general manager came over and apologized for the inability to seat me in the Swan Court as they were having several groups that evening.  I asked him about getting some photos of the outside, and he took me then while there was still some good daylight.  He unlocked the door and we went to the patio and I got some shots.  On the way back to the table, he gave me his business card for future reservations or help, and he had a liter bottle of S. Pellegrino brought to my table.  

On to the food.  I got the Parallel Tasting menu.  I'm going to use the descriptions from the menu because I could not have typed them all into my iPhone without being there for hours.

Course One was called the tomato course.  One plate had Textures of Tomato, light seared langoustine, and Ajo Blanco.  The parallel plate had Tesroa Tomato Confit, basil pearls, and aged balsamic brittle.

Course Two was the corn course.  One plate had summer corn Agnolotti, velouté, orels and fava beans, and popcorn shoots.  The parallel plate had Ruby Red Corn culantro, a Diver scallop, and Guanciale. 

Course Three was the veal course.  One plate had veal tenderloin, Australian winter truffles, porcini lasagna, and truffle vinaigrette. The parallel plate had veal sweet breads, curried cauliflower and champagne grape slices, and Budha hand citrus.

Course Four was the coconut course.  One plate had coconut scented cheesecake, Malibu rum caramel, and Lychee sorbet.  The parallel plate had coconut rice pudding, mango sorbet, and fennel crisp.  With the coconut course, I was brought a small plate with four petit fours or mignardises.  When I polished all of that off, my server brought me 3 hand made chocolate truffles.  

The food was great!  I really enjoyed the idea of the parallel plates with two takes on a given food.  Corn two ways, coconut a couple of ways, tomato, and of course the wonderful veal.

Service was exemplary.  My server, Russell, was always nearby for anything I needed without hovering.  We found out that we live not too far from each other and I showed him on Yelp the new location he can buy Bon Breads in our neighborhood.  Yea, Yelp!  The numerous bus people were all quite efficient at clearing dishes, refilling my water glass, or whatever was needed.  The staff passed my twisted artificial sweetener pack test with flying colors.  It was removed in about 8 seconds.

I really like the layout of the restaurant and if I couldn't sit in the Swan Court, I was glad to be where I was.  I am fascinated by that wine tower and I watched one of the wine angels ascend several times to get wine for a table.  This was a memorable dining experience and I will be back.  Hold the swans--I'll be there.

Edit:  I have to add that the staff let me ""play"" with one of their iPads from which you can order wines or cocktails.  I sent myself an email from the iPad describing the cocktail I didn't have but I just tried it out.  It's a neat way of remembering the wine you had without having to use your memory if you email yourself.  Too bad it's a dedicated iPad.

I decided to use it.  After all, I hadn't played miniature golf in many years and although I'm not a KISS fan, it seemed like it would be fun.  It was!!!!

From the moment I went in throughout the time I was there, I was treated beautifully by the great staff.  I didn't know any of the songs being cranked out by the KISS FM radio station that broadcasts live from the golf course, but I enjoyed the music given the surroundings.

There are plenty of black lights and the walls are painted with phosphorescent pictures of Las Vegas history--the Rat Pack, Elvis, Jerry Lewis.  The holes also have KISS related things like the high heeled boot(?) and KISS heads going up and down from boxes.  White shirts and shoe laces look clean they're so bright from the black light!  The holes are pretty easy and it is fun.

Since I was alone, the guy giving out the clubs and golf balls asked me if I was going to keep score.  I answered that no I was just going to have fun.  Since there were two groups of four in front of me, he took me to hole 6 and started me there so I wouldn't be bunched up behind the two groups. He also cautioned me not to play #18 until I had gone to play 1 through 5.  When your ball goes in Simmons' mouth, you don't get it back.

I really enjoyed the time I was here and I have to give kudos to a great staff!  They're very kind and they're very helpful to their guests.  Who would think I'd ride my bike at Lake Mead and play KISS mini golf a few hours later?

The apple picking area at the apple farm are at a different location than the store, but it's a fairly short drive (~5 min, maybe less).  The apples in season they had on the apple trees were Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, Jonathon, and Ida Red.  The apples on the trees were pretty small, but the ones I tried after picking them (Golden Delicious and Red Delicious) had lots of flavor.  The price is generally ~$1 per pound, and you get more of a discount per pound the more you pick.  

In this farm area they have a family area, with a snack shop and corn maze.  The snack shop has huge, tasty apple fritters, and next to the shop there is an outdoor stand that sells fresh kettle corn, funnel cake, and fried apple rings.  We went here the day after some rain, so we got REALLY muddy walking in the corn maze.

The store has some great items, like the hot pickled garlic and apple cinnamon butter.  They even have sugar free preserves and apple butter.  The apple cider here is excellent, some of the best I've ever had.  You can buy all different types of fresh apples already picked here.  I highly recommend the Honeycrisp apples.  They are a lot bigger, tastier, and fresher than anything you will ever buy at the grocery store.

After browsing through the menu I decided on an iced ginger coffee, the frittata, and the coffee ceremony to finish with. 

The decor is cozy and intimate, with small touches of Ethiopian-style designs. There are a few tables and booths and when we were here on a late weekday morning there were a few regulars dining here. 

The iced coffee came out first, in a frosty looking cup, a refreshing appearance right from the start. It was like the iced tea of coffee in its ability to cool you down on a hot summer day. The flavor was light, nuanced with ginger. It was so smooth I didn't need to add any additional cream or sugar. 

The frittata came next, piping hot. It was well seasoned with fluffy scrambled eggs, vegetables, with some heat from the jalapenos. 

The coffee ceremony is something you should experience here at least once. It comes on a tray with a rustic cup of sugar, two petite cups for coffee, and an equally rustic pitcher holding the coffee. The lovely lady co-owner explained to us the ritual, including the use of frankincense to surround the senses as you pour and sip your coffee. The coffee itself was smooth, infused with ginger (You have the option whether to include ginger or not). We got several pours out of the pitcher and I had enough of a buzz that I was hopping around all day with a new Ethiopian influenced burst of energy!

I saw the show with a group of Yelpies.  Since I was the most senior Yelpie there who lived and remembers the years when Elvis was performing, I was anxious to gauge the group's reaction to different segments of the show.

Most appeared to like what I do, but perhaps with a bit less enthusiasm than me.  Sure this isn't your traditional Cirque show, but what is?  Every Cirque show, and I've seen them all more than once (well I'd never put myself though Believe a second time), is different.  Each has its own blend of dance, music, and acrobatics.  As Cirque has matured in Las Vegas, it has placed a bit less emphasis on the circus like part of Cirque to the artistic, musical, dance part of Cirque.  That's neither good nor bad--it's change.

The one lame part of this show is the aerial pas de deux used as a scene changer.  I have thought this was out of place from show one, but if they leave it in, that's OK too.

We stepped in for lunch, and saw the large advertised sign on the window for $5.99 lunch. There are 2 large menus to choose from. Browsing through the menu, we couldn't find the lunch specials on it anywhere. When I asked the waiter where I could find the lunch specials on the menu though, he vaguely pointed to the 3 pictures on the window in front, and briefly described them. Maybe it's just me, but it's odd to not have at least a printed paper description of your lunch specials at your table if they are so boldly displayed on your window front. Since there were only 3 of them, it would not be that hard to describe or print out!

Anyways, we decided to share the veggie/meat Ethiopian combo ($9.50). My friend asked ""Is it good?"" and the waiter replied almost instantaneously ""It's alright."" Not very reassuring, no? So we asked what would be better. After some hesitation, he pointed to quite possibly the most benign, Americanized, and uninspiring menu item, the grilled chicken salad. He then went on to say that the combos were quite popular (...But not good?). Faced with this rather odd discourse, we decided to carry on with our plan to get an Ethiopian dish and take the risk!

The combo came out in fairly quickly. The dish came with grilled beef, chicken, and 3 veggies of your choosing. Unfortunately, despite having the waiter repeating our choices for us and pointing to them on our menu, one of the items was not the right veggie. Despite this mix up, the combo tasted good, and the injera bread went well with the meat and vegetables. 

Even though the sign out front says they were open from 11 to 10 that day, they decided to close at 1 P.M. and left the ""Open"" neon sign lit. Quite a few people tried to enter the restaurant only to find out that it was locked. We got there a little after 12 and were still eating when they locked up the door. They let us know that we could take our time and the chef could let us out when we were done, but we felt uneasy being the only customers in there, trapped inside so we left as soon as we finished. I'm not sure if they normally close at 1 P.M., but perhaps changing their signage or leaving a sign describing why you are closed just that day would help clear any confusion.

I used to really like going to Blue Nile for both the food and the service years ago, but since the change in management and name this rather odd eating experience has left me leery to frequent this restaurant again. On to Lalibela perhaps for our next Ethiopian outing!",4,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

B0Vm2tge4I2JJlZhD4sl0Q,7,2015-06-19,4,rVJ8625ikclJyWwvoaXu0A,3,"*** Review is for Restaurant Week 2015 menu ***

I had a show at 7 PM a few miles away and this seemed a good place for dinner with its 5 PM opening.  I was seated immediately and given a choice by the hostess as to which place I wanted to sit.  I opted for a two top table along the wall with a view of some of the pool area and some of the main part of  the restaurant.

The beginning service was a little slow.  It took awhile for the server to come to take my order and then there was a very long wait for the first course to come out--almost a half hour.  In addition, I saw other tables get an amuse-bouche but none was brought to me.  I assumed it wasn't part of the RW service.  Later, when I looked at my bill, the first item was an amuse-bouche listed at $0.00 as RW week menus generally do.

Edit:  I forgot when I wrote this to talk about the bread.  After ordering, you're brought a crock of bread topped with parmesan cheese and garlic.  It's a good sized piece of bread that's been scored for cutting.  It is not served with butter which is something they should do.  The top is flavored nicely.  The rest is bread that needs butter.

I ordered the heirloom tomato and ciliegine with greens and finished off with some tomato juice.  Not red tomato juice but the juice that comes from tomatoes when you cut them not crush them with pulp and skins.  The fresh mozzarella was very good.  This was a nice summer salad with refreshing ingredients.

My main course was the petit filet.  I ordered it blue.  The server looked at me and I explained I wanted it extra, extra rare.  He said, ""In other words, 30 seconds on each side.""  That was fine with me.  That's the way the steak was cooked.  Just a little brown on the exterior and a cool interior that was almost raw.  Perfect.  The filet was served on potato purée and had an assortment of summer squash.

There was no choice for the dessert course.  It was what they call a dreamsicle white chocolate mousse with tangerine gelée and rosemary scented streusel.  The mousse had a texture more like a light cheesecake than mousse but it was flavorful.  The tangerine gelée added a dimension of flavor to the dish and the streusel crunchies were a good texture.  It actually tasted like pieces of granola.

Except for the initial wait for my order taking and for the salad, service was good.  The couple of gentlemen that waited on my table were very friendly.  We chatted about other restaurants in Las Vegas and compared thoughts about one of them.  My iced tea was refilled without asking.  After awhile, I stopped looking at my watch because I knew I would make my show on time.  For a time, I was tapping my foot because I was uncertain about my time constraints.

The restaurant is a very pleasant place and the view of the young people at the pool was more than a pleasant diversion.  I'll have to come back and try the place with the traditional menu.  I am glad that they did something different with the Restaurant Week menu.",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Dishes here are reasonably priced, with plate lunches that give you a lot of food for your dollar.  Wanting to try a variety of foods, I tried the Hawaiian plate.  The plate consisted of kalua pork with cabbage, clear noodles, and some lomi salmon.  The kalua pork was great, lots of flavor, slightly smokey, and not too salty.  The clear noodles were also very good in their savory marinade.  The lomi salmon was a bit salty for my tastes, but the salmon and other ingredients themselves tasted fresh.

With a show later, I made an early reservation for Delmonico.  I was promptly greeted and seated.

I knew the steaks were large unless I got a petit filet (not my favorite cut of steak) so I ordered a bone in ribeye, a side of cheesy grits with bacon, and then bread pudding for dessert. I had a trio of servers who took good care of service.  

I ordered the steak cooked blue and it was close to that but a bit beyond.  The steak was quite average.  The steak was pre-seasoned and it was OK.  The star of dinner was the cheesy grits with bacon.  They were very good!

The bread pudding was white chocolate macadamia nut with creme Anglaise.  It was OK, too.

The dinner never had any wow factor to merit the prices charged.  Things were average except the grits.  I thought the dried branches on the poinsettia on the wall by my table reflected the lack of attention to detail one would expect of a high end restaurant like Delmonico.  

Service was very good and the servers were friendly but I left feeling somewhat disappointed.  Well, at least there'll be no need to stop and peruse the menu anymore.",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

While I'm still not a fan of friend chicken and waffles, there are so many other good things coming out of the kitchen that I could be happy never to see the chicken and waffles.

Six of us came for brunch Saturday morning and we were served by what the kitchen decided to make and send out.  

Items we received:

Buttermilk biscuits with honey butter and house made jam
Warm farmer's cheese and watermelon
Chicken salad
Friend chicken skin cheese sandwiches
Egg and sausage biscuits
Country fried steak and eggs
Chicken and waffles with watermelon cubes and honey hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup
'77 Elvis pancakes--chocolate chip pancakes, banana compote, bourbon maple syrup,peanut butter
Chimichurri steak and eggs with has browns
Strawberry shortcake
Hummingbird cake
Chess pie
S'mores brownie
Butterscotch cake with bacon frosting and butterscotch sauce with toasted pecan bourbon ice cream

Some of these dishes are not on the menu as they're experimenting with some dishes to put on a future menu.  The new country fried steak and crispy skin cheese sandwich are clear winners!  I am becoming a bigger fan of biscuits.  These are flaky and really don't need the butter or jam but they're good to try.  The chicken salad is something I've had before and it's good.  I did have some waffle and the cheddar used makes the waffles stand out.  

Any dessert you get here is fantastic.  The pastry chef, Vivian Lee, is in a league of her own.

nsNONDHbV7Vudqh21uicqw,1,2011-08-30,1,md4QFfgf7accFC4bliaAkw,4,"I love the Salt Cellar for being the lazy woman's go-to place for seafood.  If you get lobster or crab from them, the waitress will crack and de-shell it for you; it's such a great service since a lot of the time I am hesitant to get any kind of crustacean because I don't like getting messy and spending all that time getting the meat out of the shell.  The lobster here, while technically from Maine, is flown in fresh from Boston, and they offer 1.25 lb, 3 lb, and occasionally a showcase jumbo lobster.  When I went here they were touting an 8 lb lobster for those with the stomach (and coin) to spend a pretty penny on the Yao Ming of lobsters.

While the sides are very basic, the seafood is understandably the real star of the show.  While I was happy with my fresh lobster, I did try some salmon wellington, which was some of the best tasting salmon I've had in some time.  It was very tender and moist, and very fresh.  I'm also happy to report that they have soft shell crabs here this season, which is one of my favorite seafood items.

The ambiance itself, for me at least, is a bit lacking.  They don't call it the Salt Cellar for nothing, for when you descend into the restaurant through a flight of stairs, it's very dark and a bit damp and chilly.  The lighting for me is too yellow for me, and everything in general seems antiquated.  I remember eating here years and years ago, and it seems like they haven't changed anything about the decor since then!",3,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog
9AJcD4UfawSSgc5007SWAw,0,2011-11-08,0,t8Y1iwj-mNDCDB5OXkjeiQ,3,"Ocean buffet was.. acceptable.  If they had .5 star ratings, I'd prob rate it a 2.5.  We went here on a Monday night, around 7 P.M.  There were trays that had looked like they had been sitting under those heat lamps since the opening of the restaurant (such as the crawfish whose sauce had a scummy membrane on top of it).  

There was a decent variety of sushi at the sushi station.  However, it also looked VERY old and dried out, and some of the nigiri sushi fish layers had been removed by an unknown patron, leaving just a few mounds of rice.  

Like many Americanized Chinese buffets, there is a plethora of battered, fried, chicken covered with an unctuous sweet sauce.  Ocean Buffet is no exception.  Today they had ""Lover's chicken"" (AKA sweet and sour chicken), orange chicken, honey chicken... all very sweet and slightly different tasting from the other dish.  

In terms of seafood, they have crab legs here, but they looked a bit too puny and skinny for me to try them out.  They also have raw oysters, various incarnations of shrimp, some mussel dishes, and baked salmon. 

Soup was decent, probably the tastiest part of the meal.  I tried some hot and sour soup, and egg drop soup, which both had good flavor and texture.

Service was good.  Old plates were removed promptly and drinks refilled as needed.  

Price?  A little under $11 (10.79 I think, something like that) which includes soft drinks.",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

This was not at the Trop and it's worth it just to see this.

I enjoyed reading all the interpretive signs and once again, I was fascinated by the dishes that were retrieved from the ocean bottom lined up like they were sitting in a giant dishwasher.

I like that you still get a card with the name of a Titanic passenger and you can check the board at the end of the tour to see if they survived.  The person on my card died but his son survived.

Sadly, we weren't able to see Nathan Fillion because they were at capacity in the room he was at when we tried to enter.

We were anticipating a lot of people there for an Independence Day dining deal (And they do not accept reservations), so we came here for an early dinner. We got there around 4:45 and were able to get a parking space with no problem. When we left at around 6 though it was quite crowded and there was a line for parking.

We were greeted and seated promptly. After poring through the menu, we decided on the deviled eggs appetizer, and I chose the short rib tacos. I also had some of the green chile cheeseburger.

The deviled eggs were beautifully presented, and were delicious. The filling had a nice creamy, tangy zest to it, and the eggs had a sprinkling of bacon pieces on them.

The short rib tacos were quite tasty. The short rib had a lovely, slow-braised texture and rich flavor. The plate came with a huge portion of fresh guacamole, pico de gallo, kale and quinoa salad, and hand-made corn tortillas. The dish was $18, but at such as huge portion I could have easily shared it with someone else. 

The green chile burger I tried was juicy and packed with flavor, but not cooked to our specifications. It was ordered as medium-rare, but when we received it, it was closer to medium-well. It was still tasty nonetheless, but disappointing that for a $13 burger, it wasn't cooked to our requested temperature! The fries that came with the burger were excellent- perfectly crispy, yet tender on the inside. They were also dusted with a lovely bbq spice mix to add a slightly sweet, smokey flavor.

Service was good and drinks were refilled promptly as needed. 

When you leave, be sure to try one of their free salted chocolate chip cookies! When we went, the cookies were a little unevenly salted to one area, so certain areas I bit into tasted super salty.",1,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

They offer a plethora of various meats such as ribeye, traditional bulgolgi, kalbi short rib, shimrp, scallops, spicy pork, and chicken. The marinated meats are the best, since the marinade will caramelize on the grill when your meat cooks, lending itself to be a tasty experience.

We went here and shared some bulgolgi, spicy pork, and short rib. Each plate had good quality meat that, when cooked, yielded tender and flavorful bites. The dishes came with 1 bowl of rice per plate, and we also had the requisite panchan. We also had some lettuce (Romaine and green leaf) leaves to use as wraps for the meat and side-dishes.

The panchan was a pretty large variety, including potato salad, radish and cabbage kimchi, seaweed, fish cake, and pickled sweet cucumber. 

Service was a little spotty, as we had to flag down waiters sometimes after a long wait to get refills on items and drinks. 

We came as a large party of 7, and we ended up paying a little less than $19 per person including tip for 6 plates of meat and 2 sodas. Not too bad considering all of us were pretty full after our meal, and we had a huge quantity of meat consumed.

My first stop was here at the Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve.  I have friends from New Jersey who have been here twice on vacations to Las Vegas and they always said what a great place it was and they were right.

You enter the preserve through an office where you fill out a short form for contact information and save harmless for the City of Henderson.  This is good for two years.  You sign the guest book and then enter the preserve going out the back door.  There are volunteers working here who make sure you have a map and a bird pamphlet so you can mark off the birds you see if you want.  

From the back door, you're on your own to explore and enjoy!  There's a dirt track that goes basically two miles around the exterior perimeter.  You can see many of the pools this way.  There is also a dry pond in one spot where burrowing owls have been spotted.

There are two places where the preserve has observation points.  One is a boardwalk that goes out into one of the ponds where you can get closer to view some of the birds.  There are benches at the end of this walk and there are benches in many places throughout the preserve to just relax and enjoy the solitude and sounds of the birds.

There are a couple of blinds with holes at different levels for different height people to stand behind to observe the birds.  You can also get some good photos without scaring the birds.  Finally, there's a raised platform--you walk up a set of steps--that looks out over two of the ponds.  It's a great place to stop and watch what flies by.

I will be back.  This is one of those places where going just once is not enough!!",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We were brought rolls and our drinks came quickly.  We ordered several starters to share.  First was a half chorizo that was cooked with red wine and flame grilled tableside.

Next, we had the dish Halloumi, goat cheese grilled over cypress and served with a sweet and sour sauce. 

Next came the snails cooked with a chardonnay white wine and garlic sauce and broiled with mixed cheeses and served with some toast slices.

Next was Bacalao, a dish made up of salted cod, mashed potatoes, garlic, onions, eggs and extra virgin olive oil and served with a salad of mixed greens.  Lubka (Luby) told us how they treated the salt cod daily with whole milk to remove the saltiness of the cod so it wasn't overpoweringly salty.

Then onto the chicken Trinchado.  The chicken is marinated in red wine and grilled.  It's then put in the Trinchado sauce which had a nice paprika flavor and a small hint of cumin.

Then we had the Calamari curry, a bowl of nicely cooked calamari in a curry sauce that didn't hit you up front but had a nice curry tang after the fact.  It was quite good.  With the calamari, we got rice and a container of chutney.  The flavors complimented each other nicely.

When we thought we had no more room, Luby insisted we have some dessert.  We went with the tiramisu.  It's quite a different looking dish from common tiramisu.  The  ladyfingers weren't like most tiramisu but there was a wonderful chocolate and 
coffee flavor in the ladyfingers and the mascarpone cheese made this a wonderful ending dish.

Service was outstanding for the two hours or so that we were there.  We asked that the dishes not be brought out all at once and they did one at a time.  Luby came to the table and asked if it was OK to start the next dish.  She explained the dishes when she brought them and she was an absolute joy!  She's very proud of her food and she has reason to be proud!  

This was a very memorable lunch with good company, good conversation, excellent food, and outstanding and very pleasant service.  Thanks to LJ and Niyen for the heads up on Vila Algarve.

All 4 times, I've had the crispy caramel chicken.  It's an excellent dish with good tasting, deep fried battered chicken with a caramel glaze.  The glaze is a bit on the sweet side, but I like it.

Last night, I stayed true to form and ordered that.  I had a choice of brown or white rice and I went with the brown.  DInner was very good.  My wife had the Madeira chicken.  It was served with very creamy, good tasting mashed potatoes.  We shared a piece of chocolate cake for dessert.  It was huge.

Service was a bit slow last night, but we got here at the height of the busy time with people wanting to have dinner before going to see Phantom as was the case with us.  We had plenty of time and I didn't obsess with the time factor because I knew we were good.

I wish they had more large small plates on their menu.  Or if they would just downsize any of their meals for a downsized price.

My only complaint with Grand Lux is the level of the music.  It was not on when we first arrived. 10 minutes later, someone must have realized and they fired up the sound system.  At one point, it was so loud, I had to almost yell for my wife to hear me.  It got so bad, I downloaded an app for my iPhone and the decibel level averaged about 85 all the time we were there.

I have done this hike four times and I swear the last time was the LAST time I'd do it.  Hiking to the Colorado is a physically demanding hike.  Coming back up is even harder.  Your boots will be wet and they will be very slippery against the boulders.  You will bang your knees and other parts of your body.

About halfway, you get to this boulder as shown in Lily's photo.  

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RF7-W3Dc2B3FXW07Y-ZOVw?select=2D9p1_SUaOZIjQrORjnXEw#OO5O1CD1DWjAFEXi9S3gtQ

Do not go down this boulder unless you're sure you can get back up.  This will be a point at which you use great care before proceeding.   The large hot spring pools are beyond this boulder.  The ones before this have all dried up.

The caution Christie gave about the nettle should be heeded.  This stuff is nasty especially when it's brown and dead.  The small spines along the edges of living and dead nettle can get easily caught in your fingers and they are very irritating and difficult to get out.  One way to remove them even when you can't see them is to spread some Elmer's glue on your hand.  Let it completely dry and then peel off the glue.  That should get the last ones out.

This is a cold weather hike.  It's best not attempted during the warmer months no matter how early you start.

Finally, if you hike to the Colorado, the last section has been filled with river water and it has been impossible to get to the river without swimming or wading in a couple of feet of very cold water.  Use caution.

If you do this hike, you will most likely enjoy it, but hike it sensibly and know your limitations.  Since you're coming back uphill all the way, the hardest part is the way back when you're very tired and more prone to doing stupid things.",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The decor is similar in style to La Madeline or other French inspired eateries. It was decently busy when we walked in for dinner the previous times we ate here, but there was little to no wait for a table.

I've tried some ramen entrees, and a cold noodle dish here. The cold noodle dish (Hiyashi chu-ka) was a huge portion, filled with chicken, noodles, and veggies. The sauce was light but got a little too sweet for me after the first few bites. The ramen broth is excellent here. It's full flavored, and you will want to keep eating more and more! I've had the spicy ramen and the cha-su ramen, and I think the cha-su ramen's the best of the two. The spicy ramen was indeed quite spicy! But it was still good to eat, with a robust broth, bean sprouts, and noodles.

Service is friendly, and drinks are refilled as needed. They bring out a basket of bread and sweet Melba-type toast to your table, which is nice to munch on while you are waiting for your meal.

McCarran operates relatively efficiently, but sometimes the baggage wait seems interminable.  Tonight I waited and waited for my wife's suitcase to show itself on Carousel 16.  No suitcase,  I went to report it, and there was the case.  Her first leg got into Philadelphia so early, it was sent on an earlier flight.  It has been sitting there all that time.

One of the great things about McCarran is the Cannon Air Museum on the second floor above baggage claim.  There are some wonderful photos and objects of early Las Vegas airports and airlines, and it's quite interesting.

I had the turkey burger and tried some of the bacon breakfast burrito. The turkey burger was perfectly cooked, with very tender and juicy ground meat, fresh toppings, and soft bun. There was a little spiciness in the burger, contrasted with cool avocado slices in the mix. The fries that came with the meal were nice and crispy. The bacon breakfast burrito was a sizable portion, filled to the brim with bacon, egg, avocado, pico de gallo, cheese, and chipotle sauce. 

Service was fast, efficient, and very friendly. I was slightly disappointed that we didn't get a ""monthly special"" menu which had some more avocado dishes we could have chosen from, but we were pretty satisfied with the dishes we did order.",2,DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog

They offer good sugar free options, and they offer soy and coconut milk in addition to regular milk.  Service was very cheerful, and the drink was made in record time.

O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,5,2014-01-02,6,6YHytZe_geKr5i15uq0J5g,3,"I started a new December tradition this year--having breakfast on Christmas Day and New Year's Day somewhere on the Las Vegas Strip preferably with a patio and hopefully no wind.

I've been going to try Morels during Restaurant Week but never got to it.  I called last week to check that the patio was open for breakfast and that it was heated.  The woman I spoke to said, ""Oh yes!  It's very nice.""

I was there close to opening time this morning.  When I went in, I asked the host if the patio was open.  He said, ""Yes, but it's cold out.""  I replied that I knew and I had dressed warmly.  I was shown to a table facing TI.  During the 45 or so minutes I was there, I had no company on the patio and the heaters were not on nor were any turned on for my benefit.

Having read the Yelp reviews and the menu online, I think I knew when I went I would be ordering the mascarpone stuffed French toast.  I also got the Kenya AA Oaklands Estate coffee that was done in a French press.  I got a glass of tomato juice and some tabasco to make my spicy breakfast drink.

The French toast was excellent.  When I ordered, my server, Carlos, asked if I wanted the syrup on the side which was my choice.  The French toast is a nice sized round of tasty bread filled with mascarpone and topped with fresh strawberries, bananas, and a few raspberries.  The cinnamon on the toast and some crunchy sugar on the berries added to the fine flavor.  The syrup was good, but I could use it sparingly the French toast was so good.

Carlos brought me a second pot of coffee and I enjoyed sitting there watching the workers do some painting of the walls.  I hadn't seen any graffiti from New Year's Eve partiers, but maybe they were just cleaning up some foot prints where people jumped the wall to get to the closed Boulevard.

I would have given Morels four stars but for the heaters.  When you call ahead and get a yes answer and then it's not true and no one offered to light the one right behind me, it's a service let down for me.  Carlos was a fine server and we talked about where he had parked NYE so he could get to work and back to his car with the street closures.  He gave me some tips I'll put to use next year when I do go to the Boulevard or close instead of watching on TV.",5,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
igHYkXZMLAc9UdV5VnR_AA,13,2014-01-08,8,CkFdRW6DeYRK5qnuBhAMSQ,2,"Let me start by saying I'm not a fan and I doubt I will ever be back to Echo & Rig.  We came here late afternoon and there was one other party in the restaurant.  We were brought our iced tea quickly and it was refilled frequently while we were there.

I had looked at the menu online and I took some time to decide once there.  For a starter, we ordered their portobello fries which were served with an herb aioli.  This was the first I noticed that anything that stated garlic or should have had garlic (herb aioli) had no garlic taste at all.  The herb aioli was good but missing the garlic flavor.

My wife ordered the tri-tip steak--medium--even though I suggested she get medium rare and I ordered the hanger steak blue.  She was drawn to the tri-tip because the menu said lemon and garlic neither of which was evident in any way.  Garlic fail number 2.  All their steaks come with garlic chips (no garlic flavor here either--garlic fail #3) and a mushroom Rockefeller, a breadcrumb stuffed mushroom cap.

The portobello mushroom was wonderful with the light coating and the cheese shreds.  Then we waited.  We saved some of the mushrooms fries for our steak, and then we waited some more.  Approximately 20 minutes later, our server said the steaks would be right out.  He took our small plates and silver away.  About 5 minutes went by and he stopped by once again and said the steaks would be right there.  About 5 minutes later, he stopped by to say they'd be out in about a minute.  This time, he was right.

When the steaks arrived, I noticed that both had been cut in slices and I just cringed.  I absolutely hate it when this is done.  Maybe that's why so FEW places do it.  I asked if there was a culinary reason and the server said he'd ask.  When he came back he told us that the chefs said it was to make the steaks more tender.  My steak was good, but it was cooked a little more than I would do it at home.  My wife's steak was less tender and because of her medium order, which they did, the steak was less juicy and there was a fair amount of sinew that you wouldn't expect.  She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.  But above all, I'd say, please don't cut my steak.  I'm not a two year old and I'm not infirm.  I Googled this when I got home and found that the only reason (perhaps) to do this was to cut the steak against the grain the right way.

We each had a sundae for dessert.  They were OK.

I left Echo & Rig very disappointed.  The length of time from ordering to getting our mains was ridiculous when the place is less than 1/10 full.  It was a Tuesday afternoon--not date night USA at 8 PM.",22,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Jeff is a master juggler who has a great sense of humor and who interacts with the audience throughout the show.  There are plenty of laughs.

The show is almost exactly an hour.  The show is a 2 PM start time and it started right on time because he needs to get next door to Harrah's to work with Nathan Burton.

It's a bit of a drag getting into the IP with all the construction that's making over the IP as part of Caesars' Project Linq.  Don't let this deter you.  Park at Harrah's or at the Flamingo and walk.  It's very worth your effort.",2,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A,12,2014-07-15,4,7G0ujfCGfK7EpgB6EjxAww,5,"I came to Bouchon last night for their Bastille Day special menu.  It was a grand meal.  I was brought their pain d'epi with some butter and the small bowl of pistachios.  I love this bread and I have to take care I don't overdo it.

My server was Amy and she was a gem!!  I asked her about the size of the Bastille Day menu dishes and she explained they were all appetizer size.  I ordered a half dozen oysters, an order of pommes frites aux truffes, and The Saucisson platter.  

The oysters came 2 each of three different areas from which they were harvested.  Next up was the sausage assortment that came on a board.  There was one horizontally sliced piece of their bratwurst on a small bed of sauerkraut, 2 rounds of Merguez, a slice of garlic sausage en croute, and one link of their boudin blanc.  The sausages were accompanied by some whole grain mustard, some yellow mustard, a couple of cornichons, and some pickled onion slices and other small vegetables pieces.  With the platter, I was brought more bread (3 kinds), and then came the pommes frites.

It was a feast.  The sausages were all very good.  It would be a fantastic platter to serve any day but this is special for Bastille Day.

After this, I ordered Chocolate Bouchons for dessert.  These were one of their dessert specials for the night.  I didn't see macarons as was stated online when I read about their special menu for the day.  The Bouchons were small, vertical brownies with a small scoop of ice cream with coconut, one fresh cheerry dipped in chocolate and chilled before serving.  There was also some raspberry syrup on the plate.  The Bouchons were great.

I have an affair with Bouchon.  I have been there several times and I just like the bistro atmosphere and looking out the window and seeing that lovely park area with pools on the 10th floor of the building that's so private and away from the rest of the Venetian/Venezia/Palazzo Resort.  Bouchon has been the place I've reviewed the most.  It's one of those places that just puts a smile on my face and I look forward to going there.  Service is always first rate and the food is very good.

I think I have a new Bastille Day tradition that started last night!",9,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q
SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,13,2015-04-28,8,4FSHZV6Zo9TrTfMQhL95qg,4,"Two of us came here for dinner last evening.  A front patio table had been reserved for us.  

Our server was Carlos and we was absolutely top notch--the best!

The two of us shared all of then plates.  We started with the chicken liver and capers toasted bread.  Very good.  Next, we had the risotto with tripe and mushrooms.  This was better than the last time I had the dish when I was here for a Yelp event.  There was more spiciness to the dish.

Next we had the octopus with black squid ink cous cous.  Cooked perfectly and very tasty.  This was followed by our favorite of the night, the quail saltimbocca--boneless quail wrapped with prosciutto.  It was excellent.  Four nice sized pieces of quail with the prosciutto.  A perfect dish for sharing.

Then we had the branzino that was on top of capers, olive slices, and tomatoes.  The last tapas dish we shared was the 7 and 7, potato gnocchi with lobster knuckles.  The gnocchi and the lobster were very good.  Not yet quite full, we ordered the osso buco served on a bed of creamy cheese polenta.  The osso buco was flavorful and had a fair amount of meat.  The cheese flavor of the polenta was absent.

Not quite done, we ordered two desserts--one that my dining companion had heard was very good and one Carlos recommended.  My companion wanted the giandujotto, hazelnut ice cream with another piece of hazelnut cream encased in a chocolate coating.  Carlos recommended the panna cotta with mango sorbet and sliced fruit.  Both were good but the panna cotta was the best.  It was light and exactly the kind of dessert to have after the meal we had eaten.  It was light, flavorful, and citrusy.

Service throughout our two and a half hours there was the best you could want.  Carlos was extremely knowledgable about the dishes and when asked, he was pleased to recommend things.  Our water glasses never got below being half empty--yes, I'm a half empty kind of person--and Carlos brought a fresh glass of iced tea to me before I was finished with the current one.

With the beautiful patio and the view of the fountains and Paris Las Vegas, it was a memorable evening.  I'm plotting when I can return and try some of the things I saw on the menu that will draw me back.",14,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

We met a friend from Toronto who was in town for 2 weeks for bridge tournaments and gaming.  This is one of the places he hits up every time he comes to Las Vegas.

We had reservations for 5:30--not needed as it turned out--but there were more people there than I had expected.  We were quickly seated, brought menus, and our drink order was delivered.  We then ordered and the server split the order into two checks as we requested.

My wife ordered the Chicken Cortez and Jack and I each ordered prime rib.  Each dinner comes with soup or salad and choice of starch.  I got potato leek and a baked potato.  I asked for my prime rib to be blue and the server said very rare to which I nodded.  We also ordered a side of scalloped corn with prosciutto to share.

Bread was brought to the table along with two plates of pastry piped butter.  There didn't appear to be any difference in taste among the three.  The lavash was not as flavorful as some I've had and the pretzel roll was somewhat dry.  It seemed like the bread was a little on the old side.

The soup was good.  One of the bus people came to grind fresh pepper which was a bonus.  There was a good separation between courses so we could chat and catch up with what our friend had been up to since we saw him a few months before.

Our mains arrived.  The prime rib was red as I wanted and Jack's was a medium rare which was what he ordered.  Andrea's chicken was, well chicken with cheese melted on top and some avocado.  My baked potato was large but needed a bit more baking time.  I got the normal accoutrements--butter and sour cream and the waiter left extra horseradish if we wanted to charge up the creamy horseradish served with the prime rib.  All three of us liked our meals.  The scalloped corn was very good.  Creamed corn with lots of cheese baked until the light bread crumb top was browned.

For dessert, I got carrot cake which was quite good.

The Cortez Room is OK.   Service was OK if not a bit nonchalant.  The price was good because the casino had mailed a BOGO to my wife and we used points to pay the balance.  For the price of gratuity, we had dinner for two.  The A-OK rating is apropos  because while nothing stands out about the whole evening, the food was OK and done the way we wanted.",7,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The concrete was good, and was thick and rich, with chunks of cheesecake and small bits of cherry (more chunks of cherry would have been nice, but it still tasted great).  I wasn't a big fan of the cheese curds.  They are basically like a mini version of a mozzarella stick, battered and fried.

Same poke bowls, different location. This ahipoki location seems smaller than the Scottsdale restaurant and the dedicated building parking lot is small, although there is plenty of parking surrounding the immediate area. There is a drive through area as well but I'm not sure if they are offering drive through for the bowls.

We went for the soft opening around 2:15 and while there was a steady stream of customers it wasn't extremely crowded. I went with a 2 scoop bowl with salad, house dressing, luau tuna, yellowtail, masago, crab salad, edamame, jicama, seaweed salad, cucumber, seaweed strips, crispy onion, and sesame seed. The fish was fresh and flavorful, and I liked it with the other ingredients except for the crispy onion. The onion bits were too hard and distracted from the other textures in the salad.

I also had an iced tea, which comes unsweetened. It was light and refreshing.

The 2 scoop portion was a little under $9 and the iced tea was $2.99. 

Service was fast and friendly.
