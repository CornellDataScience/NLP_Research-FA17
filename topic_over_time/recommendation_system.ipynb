Boom - out comes the food.  The meal was around 3-4 courses and included cooked appetizers, sushi rolls, and beef / pork proteins.  Each course was fresh - hot dishes hot, cold dishes cold and tasted great.  The ribeye was a bit overcooked, but given how many they crank out, it wasn't a huge disappointment.

If you're able to get a table to let you pass by them to get to the little stage-ish part in front of the dance floor, you can stand there and get a great view.

      "This club's layout is such that unless you have a table(i.e bottle service), you're basically always kind of uncomfortable. The dance floor is too small for the crowd, the second floor's view to the dance floor is completely blocked by the tables there, so people kind of flow around narrow passage ways up and down the club, and look for somewhere to be able to stand. The layout gives you the feel of being in somewhat of a maze, and it basically is such that it gives the feeling of saying to you; if you didn't get bottle service, your bad!\n",

      "I just wanted to hit a dance club while in Vegas and this one was close in the MGM. I gotta thank my friends for paying for the bottle service and getting us ahead of all the long lines for the bachelor party. Not many clubs in Vegas wanting to let 6 guys in without any females these days! On that note, I had a great time and was glad for the experience. I would say this place was fun, but my favorites in Vegas are still XS and Surrender...\n",

      "So....After my review, I was contacted by management. They were sorry to hear about my visit at HK and wanted me to come back and really \"experience\" the club with 5 floors, a restaurant, yada yada yada.  So they asked when I would be back.  I told them that I would be back on June 19.  The first manager then emailed a Manager in Customer Relations and she kept in contact with me over the next 3 months.  I was really impressed.  As the date grew near, I was then put in touch with the Director of Guest Services who would be on site that night - that person notified me that I would be given complimentary VIP entry and walked in. (In all honesty, we always use a VIP service that does that anyways.)   She also gave me the name of a contact at the door and a phone number.  I was curious how my new \"experience\" would be different from my old \"experience\", but it was a nice gesture...\n",

He looked at us with a blank face and said,  \"We don't have a guest list tonight and I don't know who those people are\".  REALLY????  So he didn't know that Director of Guest Relations?
