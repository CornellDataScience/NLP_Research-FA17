      "Worst place to eat in Vegas!! Right after I was seated my waiter came by and offered to get me water and the only choice he gave me was whether I wanted ice or not. Later, I heard him ask the folks on a nearby table if they would like bottled water, sparkling water or still etc. Then, it took him about 7-8 minutes to come and take my order. And then the food came only 15 minutes later. While I was eating, he never once came to ask me how it was going or whether I wanted anything else. \n",

      "I had to ask another waiter to get me some hot tea. The edamame was suspect, some pieces were downright mushy. The sushi was only so-so. I have had far better sushi, even at far cheaper restaurants. The sushi rice was not fully cooked and certainly poor in taste. The cloth napkin had a stale oily smell. And the miso soup was too salty. What a waste of money!!\n",

The dance floor is too small for the crowd, the second floor's view to the dance floor is completely blocked by the tables there, so people kind of flow around narrow passage ways up and down the club, and look for somewhere to be able to stand.

      "So....After my review, I was contacted by management. They were sorry to hear about my visit at HK and wanted me to come back and really \"experience\" the club with 5 floors, a restaurant, yada yada yada.  So they asked when I would be back.  I told them that I would be back on June 19.  The first manager then emailed a Manager in Customer Relations and she kept in contact with me over the next 3 months.  I was really impressed.  As the date grew near, I was then put in touch with the Director of Guest Services who would be on site that night - that person notified me that I would be given complimentary VIP entry and walked in. (In all honesty, we always use a VIP service that does that anyways.)   She also gave me the name of a contact at the door and a phone number.  I was curious how my new \"experience\" would be different from my old \"experience\", but it was a nice gesture...\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, we arrived at HK at 12:15 (not too late, and not too early).  When we arrived, there was a velvet rope out front with a mob of people around it. Nobody was lined up, just a crowd.  My husband and I finally worked our way to the front and said that we were guests of  So & So and showed him the email to prove that I wasn't just throwing a name around.  He looked at us with a blank face and said,  \"We don't have a guest list tonight and I don't know who those people are\".  REALLY????  So he didn't know that Director of Guest Relations?  If HK is trying to make a better name for themselves, they need to teach the door guys names of management....At this point  I was fed up with this place and didn't try to text my \"door contact\".  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, basically, nothing has changed.  Head down the strip to another club...unless you want a cr@ppy \"experience\".\n",

    "Now our observation is split by quarters (3 month period). For each quarter, we have an average rating for this period and an offset from the particular business rating. This metric represents how successful the given time period was. We are now, observing the sequence of latent topic embeddings and see if we can find any correlations between success of business over time. As a baseline analysis, I apply linear regression and compare the correlation between the coefficient of each topic (slope) and overall success of the quater. \n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, each topic has much greater correlation than I saw with earlier experiments. This means the sequence of topics have more significant meaning than the raw value of embedding itself. We can later validate which embedding is the best one by giving the classification task. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the results suggest the growth of some topics are highly correlated with the growth of business. Intuitively those topics are area the business should focus on more to improve their business. Some interesting topic that I observe across different embeddings are topic 16, which contains the word, 'gluten free'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the negative correlation means the topic which might hurt the business, if they focus on. Something I see particularly is topic 47 which is about 'serving time'. But this could also mean, 47 is inheritantly a complaint about bad serving time, and decrease in this topic could suggest their improvement in the serving time."
