# Temporal Trend-Aware Rating System

The overarching goal of this project is to develop a star-rating prediction system that will allow users to get a better idea of long-term business performance. We are accomplishing this by testing and training multi-feature classifiers and comparing which types of classifiers work best when predicting star ratings. The features in our classifiers are different, relevant topics generated using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. Classifiers we are currently working on are single-feature and multi-feature linear regression. We will be developing SVMs this upcoming week. Another aspect that we intend to study this semester is what an appropriate time interval size would be in order for our classifiers to most optimally predict the next star rating in the next time interval. (i.e. a month, a week, 90 days, etc.)
