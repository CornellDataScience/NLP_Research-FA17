We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.
A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.
To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.
Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.
Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.
The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.
This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.
If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.
[10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.
At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.
We need your donations more than ever!
All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.
(CMU = Carnegie-
Mellon University).

Executive Director's Notes:
In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
are presented herein:

***
As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a "cliche".
.
.this is the
original meaning of the term cliche.
.
.and thus, being unwilling
to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd.
.
.such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
above.
.
.and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner.
.
.
.
The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
time when they were out of "v"'s.
.
.possibly having used "vv" in
place of some "w"'s, etc.
This was a common practice of the day,
as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.
You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.
My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose.
To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
.
.
.in great detail.
.
.and determined from the various changes,
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
for signing his name with several different spellings.
So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
that are "not" errors.
.
.
.
So.
.
.with this caveat.
.
.we have NOT changed the canon errors,
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie
of Hamlet.

Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.
This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text.
The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae.
I have left the spelling,
punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text.
I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them.
Everything within
brackets [] is what I have added.
So if you don't like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare.
Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio.
So there may
be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
this and other first folio editions.
This is due to the printer's
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run.
The proof run wasn't thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies.
This is just the way it is.
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions' best pages.
If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors.
I wish to make this the best
etext possible.
My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
and davidr@inconnect.com.
I hope that you enjoy this.

The Tragedie of Hamlet
Actus Primus.
Scoena Prima.
Enter Barnardo and Francisco two Centinels.
Barnardo.
Who's there?
Fran.
Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold


your selfe


   Bar.
Long liue the King
   Fran.
Barnardo?
Bar.
He


   Fran.
You come most carefully vpon your houre
   Bar.
'Tis now strook twelue, get thee to bed Francisco
   Fran.
For this releefe much thankes: 'Tis bitter cold,


And I am sicke at heart


   Barn.
Haue you had quiet Guard?
Fran.
Not a Mouse stirring


   Barn.
Well, goodnight.
If you do meet Horatio and


Marcellus, the Riuals of my Watch, bid them make hast.
Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
Fran.
I thinke I heare them.
Stand: who's there?
Hor.
Friends to this ground


   Mar.
And Leige-men to the Dane
   Fran.
Giue you good night
   Mar.
O farwel honest Soldier, who hath relieu'd you?
Fra.
Barnardo ha's my place: giue you goodnight.
Exit Fran.
Mar.
Holla Barnardo
   Bar.
Say, what is Horatio there?
Hor.
A peece of him


   Bar.
Welcome Horatio, welcome good Marcellus
   Mar.
What, ha's this thing appear'd againe to night
   Bar.
I haue seene nothing
   Mar.
Horatio saies, 'tis but our Fantasie,


And will not let beleefe take hold of him


Touching this dreaded sight, twice seene of vs,


Therefore I haue intreated him along


With vs, to watch the minutes of this Night,


That if againe this Apparition come,


He may approue our eyes, and speake to it


   Hor.
Tush, tush, 'twill not appeare
   Bar.
Sit downe a-while,


And let vs once againe assaile your eares,


That are so fortified against our Story,


What we two Nights haue seene


   Hor.
Well, sit we downe,


And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this


   Barn.
Last night of all,


When yond same Starre that's Westward from the Pole


Had made his course t' illume that part of Heauen


Where now it burnes, Marcellus and my selfe,


The Bell then beating one


   Mar.
Peace, breake thee of:


Enter the Ghost.
Looke where it comes againe
   Barn.
In the same figure, like the King that's dead
   Mar.
Thou art a Scholler; speake to it Horatio
   Barn.
Lookes it not like the King?
Marke it Horatio
   Hora.
Most like: It harrowes me with fear & wonder


  Barn.
It would be spoke too


   Mar.
Question it Horatio
   Hor.
What art thou that vsurp'st this time of night,


Together with that Faire and Warlike forme


In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke


Did sometimes march: By Heauen I charge thee speake


   Mar.
It is offended
   Barn.
See, it stalkes away
   Hor.
Stay: speake; speake: I Charge thee, speake.
Exit the Ghost.
Mar.
'Tis gone, and will not answer
   Barn.
How now Horatio?
You tremble & look pale:


Is not this something more then Fantasie?
What thinke you on't?
Hor.
Before my God, I might not this beleeue


Without the sensible and true auouch


Of mine owne eyes


   Mar.
Is it not like the King?
Hor.
As thou art to thy selfe,


Such was the very Armour he had on,


When th' Ambitious Norwey combatted:


So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle


He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice.
'Tis strange


   Mar.
Thus twice before, and iust at this dead houre,


With Martiall stalke, hath he gone by our Watch


   Hor.
In what particular thought to work, I know not:


But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion,


This boades some strange erruption to our State


   Mar.
Good now sit downe, & tell me he that knowes


Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch,


So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land,


And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon


And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:


Why such impresse of Ship-wrights, whose sore Taske


Do's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke,


What might be toward, that this sweaty hast


Doth make the Night ioynt-Labourer with the day:


Who is't that can informe me?
Hor.
That can I,


At least the whisper goes so: Our last King,


Whose Image euen but now appear'd to vs,


Was (as you know) by Fortinbras of Norway,


(Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate Pride)


Dar'd to the Combate.
In which, our Valiant Hamlet,


(For so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him)


Did slay this Fortinbras: who by a Seal'd Compact,


Well ratified by Law, and Heraldrie,


Did forfeite (with his life) all those his Lands


Which he stood seiz'd on, to the Conqueror:


Against the which, a Moity competent


Was gaged by our King: which had return'd


To the Inheritance of Fortinbras,


Had he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nant


And carriage of the Article designe,


His fell to Hamlet.
Now sir, young Fortinbras,


Of vnimproued Mettle, hot and full,


Hath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,


Shark'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes,


For Foode and Diet, to some Enterprize


That hath a stomacke in't: which is no other


(And it doth well appeare vnto our State)


But to recouer of vs by strong hand


And termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid Lands


So by his Father lost: and this (I take it)


Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations,


The Sourse of this our Watch, and the cheefe head


Of this post-hast, and Romage in the Land.
Enter Ghost againe.
But soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe:


Ile crosse it, though it blast me.
Stay Illusion:


If thou hast any sound, or vse of Voyce,


Speake to me.
If there be any good thing to be done,


That may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me.
If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate


(Which happily foreknowing may auoyd) Oh speake.
Or, if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy life


Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth,


(For which, they say, you Spirits oft walke in death)


Speake of it.
Stay, and speake.
Stop it Marcellus


   Mar.
Shall I strike at it with my Partizan?
Hor.
Do, if it will not stand


   Barn.
'Tis heere
   Hor.
'Tis heere
   Mar.
'Tis gone.
Exit Ghost.
We do it wrong, being so Maiesticall


To offer it the shew of Violence,


For it is as the Ayre, invulnerable,


And our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery


   Barn.
It was about to speake, when the Cocke crew
   Hor.
And then it started, like a guilty thing


Vpon a fearfull Summons.
I haue heard,


The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day,


Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding Throate


Awake the God of Day: and at his warning,


Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,


Th' extrauagant, and erring Spirit, hyes


To his Confine.
And of the truth heerein,


This present Obiect made probation


   Mar.
It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.
Some sayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comes


Wherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated,


The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long:


And then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad,


The nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike,


No Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:


So hallow'd, and so gracious is the time


   Hor.
So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it.
But looke, the Morne in Russet mantle clad,


Walkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,


Breake we our Watch vp, and by my aduice


Let vs impart what we haue seene to night


Vnto yong Hamlet.
For vpon my life,


This Spirit dumbe to vs, will speake to him:


Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,


As needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty?
Mar.
Let do't I pray, and I this morning know


Where we shall finde him most conueniently.
Exeunt.
Scena Secunda.
Enter Claudius King of Denmarke, Gertrude the Queene, Hamlet,


Polonius,


Laertes, and his Sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant.
King.
Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death


The memory be greene: and that it vs befitted


To beare our hearts in greefe, and our whole Kingdome


To be contracted in one brow of woe:


Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature,


That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him,


Together with remembrance of our selues.
Therefore our sometimes Sister, now our Queene,


Th' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State,


Haue we, as 'twere, with a defeated ioy,


With one Auspicious, and one Dropping eye,


With mirth in Funerall, and with Dirge in Marriage,


In equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole


Taken to Wife; nor haue we heerein barr'd


Your better Wisedomes, which haue freely gone


With this affaire along, for all our Thankes.
Now followes, that you know young Fortinbras,


Holding a weake supposall of our worth;


Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death,


Our State to be disioynt, and out of Frame,


Colleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage;


He hath not fayl'd to pester vs with Message,


Importing the surrender of those Lands


Lost by his Father: with all Bonds of Law


To our most valiant Brother.
So much for him.
Enter Voltemand and Cornelius.
Now for our selfe, and for this time of meeting


Thus much the businesse is.
We haue heere writ


To Norway, Vncle of young Fortinbras,


Who Impotent and Bedrid, scarsely heares


Of this his Nephewes purpose, to suppresse


His further gate heerein.
In that the Leuies,


The Lists, and full proportions are all made


Out of his subiect: and we heere dispatch


You good Cornelius, and you Voltemand,


For bearing of this greeting to old Norway,


Giuing to you no further personall power


To businesse with the King, more then the scope


Of these dilated Articles allow:


Farewell, and let your hast commend your duty


   Volt.
In that, and all things, will we shew our duty
   King.
We doubt it nothing, heartily farewell.
Exit Voltemand and Cornelius.
And now Laertes, what's the newes with you?
You told vs of some suite.
What is't Laertes?
You cannot speake of Reason to the Dane,


And loose your voyce.
What would'st thou beg Laertes,


That shall not be my Offer, not thy Asking?
The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart,


The Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth,


Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father.
What would'st thou haue Laertes?
Laer.
Dread my Lord,


Your leaue and fauour to returne to France,


From whence, though willingly I came to Denmarke


To shew my duty in your Coronation,


Yet now I must confesse, that duty done,


My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France,


And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon


   King.
Haue you your Fathers leaue?
What sayes Pollonius?
Pol.
He hath my Lord:


I do beseech you giue him leaue to go


   King.
Take thy faire houre Laertes, time be thine,


And thy best graces spend it at thy will:


But now my Cosin Hamlet, and my Sonne?
Ham.
A little more then kin, and lesse then kinde


   King.
How is it that the Clouds still hang on you?
Ham.
Not so my Lord, I am too much i'th' Sun


   Queen.
Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off,


And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.
Do not for euer with thy veyled lids


Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust;


Thou know'st 'tis common, all that liues must dye,


Passing through Nature, to Eternity


   Ham.
I Madam, it is common
   Queen.
If it be;


Why seemes it so particular with thee


   Ham.
Seemes Madam?
Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:


'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)


Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke,


Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,


No, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye,


Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage,


Together with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe,


That can denote me truly.
These indeed Seeme,


For they are actions that a man might play:


But I haue that Within, which passeth show;


These, but the Trappings, and the Suites of woe


   King.
'Tis sweet and commendable


In your Nature Hamlet,


To giue these mourning duties to your Father:


But you must know, your Father lost a Father,


That Father lost, lost his, and the Suruiuer bound


In filiall Obligation, for some terme


To do obsequious Sorrow.
But to perseuer


In obstinate Condolement, is a course


Of impious stubbornnesse.
'Tis vnmanly greefe,


It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen,


A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,


An Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd:


For, what we know must be, and is as common


As any the most vulgar thing to sence,


Why should we in our peeuish Opposition


Take it to heart?
Fye, 'tis a fault to Heauen,


A fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature,


To Reason most absurd, whose common Theame


Is death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,


From the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day,


This must be so.
We pray you throw to earth


This vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs


As of a Father; For let the world take note,


You are the most immediate to our Throne,


And with no lesse Nobility of Loue,


Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne,


Do I impart towards you.
For your intent


In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,


It is most retrograde to our desire:


And we beseech you, bend you to remaine


Heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye,


Our cheefest Courtier Cosin, and our Sonne


   Qu.
Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet:


I prythee stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg


   Ham.
I shall in all my best


Obey you Madam


   King.
Why 'tis a louing, and a faire Reply,


Be as our selfe in Denmarke.
Madam come,


This gentle and vnforc'd accord of Hamlet


Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,


No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day,


But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell,


And the Kings Rouce, the Heauens shall bruite againe,


Respeaking earthly Thunder.
Come away.
Exeunt.
Manet Hamlet.
Ham.
Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt,


Thaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew:


Or that the Euerlasting had not fixt


His Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slaughter.
O God, O God!
How weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable


Seemes to me all the vses of this world?
Fie on't?
Oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded Garden


That growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in Nature


Possesse it meerely.
That it should come to this:


But two months dead: Nay, not so much; not two,


So excellent a King, that was to this


Hiperion to a Satyre: so louing to my Mother,


That he might not beteene the windes of heauen


Visit her face too roughly.
Heauen and Earth


Must I remember: why she would hang on him,


As if encrease of Appetite had growne


By what is fed on; and yet within a month?
Let me not thinke on't: Frailty, thy name is woman.
A little Month, or ere those shooes were old,


With which she followed my poore Fathers body


Like Niobe, all teares.
Why she, euen she.
(O Heauen!
A beast that wants discourse of Reason


Would haue mourn'd longer) married with mine Vnkle,


My Fathers Brother: but no more like my Father,


Then I to Hercules.
Within a Moneth?
Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares


Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes,


She married.
O most wicked speed, to post


With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets:


It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
But breake my heart, for I must hold my tongue.
Enter Horatio, Barnardo, and Marcellus.
Hor.
Haile to your Lordship
   Ham.
I am glad to see you well:


Horatio, or I do forget my selfe


   Hor.
The same my Lord,


And your poore Seruant euer


   Ham.
Sir my good friend,


Ile change that name with you:


And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio?
Marcellus


   Mar.
My good Lord
   Ham.
I am very glad to see you: good euen Sir.
But what in faith make you from Wittemberge?
Hor.
A truant disposition, good my Lord


   Ham.
I would not haue your Enemy say so;


Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence,


To make it truster of your owne report


Against your selfe.
I know you are no Truant:


But what is your affaire in Elsenour?
Wee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart


   Hor.
My Lord, I came to see your Fathers Funerall
   Ham.
I pray thee doe not mock me (fellow Student)


I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding


   Hor.
Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon
   Ham.
Thrift thrift Horatio: the Funerall Bakt-meats


Did coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables;


Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen,


Ere I had euer seene that day Horatio.
My father, me thinkes I see my father


   Hor.
Oh where my Lord?
Ham.
In my minds eye (Horatio)


  Hor.
I saw him once; he was a goodly King


   Ham.
He was a man, take him for all in all:


I shall not look vpon his like againe


   Hor.
My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight
   Ham.
Saw?
Who?
Hor.
My Lord, the King your Father


   Ham.
The King my Father?
Hor.
Season your admiration for a while


With an attent eare; till I may deliuer


Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,


This maruell to you


   Ham.
For Heauens loue let me heare
   Hor.
Two nights together, had these Gentlemen


(Marcellus and Barnardo) on their Watch


In the dead wast and middle of the night


Beene thus encountred.
A figure like your Father,


Arm'd at all points exactly, Cap a Pe,


Appeares before them, and with sollemne march


Goes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt,


By their opprest and feare-surprized eyes,


Within his Truncheons length; whilst they bestil'd


Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare,


Stand dumbe and speake not to him.
This to me


In dreadfull secrecie impart they did,


And I with them the third Night kept the Watch,


Whereas they had deliuer'd both in time,


Forme of the thing; each word made true and good,


The Apparition comes.
I knew your Father:


These hands are not more like


   Ham.
But where was this?
Mar.
My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht


   Ham.
Did you not speake to it?
Hor.
My Lord, I did;


But answere made it none: yet once me thought


It lifted vp it head, and did addresse


It selfe to motion, like as it would speake:


But euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;


And at the sound it shrunke in hast away,


And vanisht from our sight


   Ham.
Tis very strange
   Hor.
As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true;


And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty


To let you know of it


   Ham.
Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to Night?
Both.
We doe my Lord


   Ham.
Arm'd, say you?
Both.
Arm'd, my Lord


   Ham.
From top to toe?
Both.
My Lord, from head to foote


   Ham.
Then saw you not his face?
Hor.
O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beauer vp


   Ham.
What, lookt he frowningly?
Hor.
A countenance more in sorrow then in anger


   Ham.
Pale, or red?
Hor.
Nay very pale


   Ham.
And fixt his eyes vpon you?
Hor.
Most constantly


   Ham.
I would I had beene there
   Hor.
It would haue much amaz'd you
   Ham.
Very like, very like: staid it long?
Hor.
While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred


   All.
Longer, longer
   Hor.
Not when I saw't
   Ham.
His Beard was grisly?
no
   Hor.
It was, as I haue seene it in his life,


A Sable Siluer'd


   Ham.
Ile watch to Night; perchance 'twill wake againe
   Hor.
I warrant you it will
   Ham.
If it assume my noble Fathers person,


Ile speake to it, though Hell it selfe should gape


And bid me hold my peace.
I pray you all,


If you haue hitherto conceald this sight;


Let it bee treble in your silence still:


And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night,


Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue;


I will requite your loues; so fare ye well:


Vpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue,


Ile visit you


   All.
Our duty to your Honour.
Exeunt
   Ham.
Your loue, as mine to you: farewell.
My Fathers Spirit in Armes?
All is not well:


I doubt some foule play: would the Night were come;


Till then sit still my soule; foule deeds will rise,


Though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies.
Enter.
Scena Tertia
Enter Laertes and Ophelia.
Laer.
My necessaries are imbark't; Farewell:


And Sister, as the Winds giue Benefit,


And Conuoy is assistant; doe not sleepe,


But let me heare from you


   Ophel.
Doe you doubt that?
Laer.
For Hamlet, and the trifling of his fauours,


Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude;


A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature;


Froward, not permanent; sweet not lasting


The suppliance of a minute?
No more


   Ophel.
No more but so
   Laer.
Thinke it no more:


For nature cressant does not grow alone,


In thewes and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,


The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule


Growes wide withall.
Perhaps he loues you now,


And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch


The vertue of his feare: but you must feare


His greatnesse weigh'd, his will is not his owne;


For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth:


Hee may not, as vnuallued persons doe,


Carue for himselfe; for, on his choyce depends


The sanctity and health of the whole State.
And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd


Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body,


Whereof he is the Head.
Then if he sayes he loues you,


It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;


As he in his peculiar Sect and force


May giue his saying deed: which is no further,


Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall.
Then weight what losse your Honour may sustaine,


If with too credent eare you list his Songs;


Or lose your Heart; or your chast Treasure open


To his vnmastred importunity.
Feare it Ophelia, feare it my deare Sister,


And keepe within the reare of your Affection;


Out of the shot and danger of Desire.
The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough,


If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone:


Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes,


The Canker Galls, the Infants of the Spring


Too oft before the buttons be disclos'd,


And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth,


Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then, best safety lies in feare;


Youth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere


   Ophe.
I shall th' effect of this good Lesson keepe,


As watchmen to my heart: but good my Brother


Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe,


Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen;


Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine


Himselfe, the Primrose path of dalliance treads,


And reaks not his owne reade


   Laer.
Oh, feare me not.
Enter Polonius.
I stay too long; but here my Father comes:


A double blessing is a double grace;


Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue


   Polon.
Yet heere Laertes?
Aboord, aboord for shame,


The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile,


And you are staid for there: my blessing with you;


And these few Precepts in thy memory,


See thou Character.
Giue thy thoughts no tongue,


Nor any vnproportion'd thoughts his Act:


Be thou familiar; but by no meanes vulgar:


The friends thou hast, and their adoption tride,


Grapple them to thy Soule, with hoopes of Steele:


But doe not dull thy palme, with entertainment


Of each vnhatch't, vnfledg'd Comrade.
Beware


Of entrance to a quarrell: but being in


Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
Giue euery man thine eare; but few thy voyce:


Take each mans censure; but reserue thy iudgement:


Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy;


But not exprest in fancie; rich, not gawdie:


For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man.
And they in France of the best ranck and station,


Are of a most select and generous cheff in that.
Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;


For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend:


And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry.
This aboue all; to thine owne selfe be true:


And it must follow, as the Night the Day,


Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell: my Blessing season this in thee


   Laer.
Most humbly doe I take my leaue, my Lord
   Polon.
The time inuites you, goe, your seruants tend
   Laer.
Farewell Ophelia, and remember well


What I haue said to you


   Ophe.
Tis in my memory lockt,


And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it


   Laer.
Farewell.
Exit Laer.
Polon.
What ist Ophelia he hath said to you?
Ophe.
So please you, somthing touching the L[ord].
Hamlet


   Polon.
Marry, well bethought:


Tis told me he hath very oft of late


Giuen priuate time to you; and you your selfe


Haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous.
If it be so, as so tis put on me;


And that in way of caution: I must tell you,


You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely,


As it behoues my Daughter, and your Honour.
What is betweene you, giue me vp the truth?
Ophe.
He hath my Lord of late, made many tenders


Of his affection to me


   Polon.
Affection, puh.
You speake like a greene Girle,


Vnsifted in such perillous Circumstance.
Doe you beleeue his tenders, as you call them?
Ophe.
I do not know, my Lord, what I should thinke


   Polon.
Marry Ile teach you; thinke your selfe a Baby,


That you haue tane his tenders for true pay,


Which are not starling.
Tender your selfe more dearly;


Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase,


Roaming it thus, you'l tender me a foole


   Ophe.
My Lord, he hath importun'd me with loue,


In honourable fashion


   Polon.
I, fashion you may call it, go too, go too
   Ophe.
And hath giuen countenance to his speech,


My Lord, with all the vowes of Heauen


   Polon.
I, Springes to catch Woodcocks.
I doe know


When the Bloud burnes, how Prodigall the Soule


Giues the tongue vowes: these blazes, Daughter,


Giuing more light then heate; extinct in both,


Euen in their promise, as it is a making;


You must not take for fire.
For this time Daughter,


Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence;


Set your entreatments at a higher rate,


Then a command to parley.
For Lord Hamlet,


Beleeue so much in him, that he is young,


And with a larger tether may he walke,


Then may be giuen you.
In few, Ophelia,


Doe not beleeue his vowes; for they are Broakers,


Not of the eye, which their Inuestments show:


But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes,


Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds,


The better to beguile.
This is for all:


I would not, in plaine tearmes, from this time forth,


Haue you so slander any moment leisure,


As to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet:


Looke too't, I charge you; come your wayes


   Ophe.
I shall obey my Lord.
Exeunt.
Enter Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus.
Ham.
The Ayre bites shrewdly: is it very cold?
Hor.
It is a nipping and an eager ayre


   Ham.
What hower now?
Hor.
I thinke it lacks of twelue


   Mar.
No, it is strooke
   Hor.
Indeed I heard it not: then it drawes neere the season,


Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke.
What does this meane my Lord?
Ham.
The King doth wake to night, and takes his rouse,


Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles,


And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe,


The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out


The triumph of his Pledge


   Horat.
Is it a custome?
Ham.
I marry ist;


And to my mind, though I am natiue heere,


And to the manner borne: It is a Custome


More honour'd in the breach, then the obseruance.
Enter Ghost.
Hor.
Looke my Lord, it comes
   Ham.
Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs:


Be thou a Spirit of health, or Goblin damn'd,


Bring with thee ayres from Heauen, or blasts from Hell,


Be thy euents wicked or charitable,


Thou com'st in such a questionable shape


That I will speake to thee.
Ile call thee Hamlet,


King, Father, Royall Dane: Oh, oh, answer me,


Let me not burst in Ignorance; but tell


Why thy Canoniz'd bones Hearsed in death,


Haue burst their cerments, why the Sepulcher


Wherein we saw thee quietly enurn'd,


Hath op'd his ponderous and Marble iawes,


To cast thee vp againe?
What may this meane?
That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele,


Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone,


Making Night hidious?
And we fooles of Nature,


So horridly to shake our disposition,


With thoughts beyond thee; reaches of our Soules,


Say, why is this?
wherefore?
what should we doe?
Ghost beckens Hamlet.
Hor.
It beckons you to goe away with it,


As if it some impartment did desire


To you alone


   Mar.
Looke with what courteous action


It wafts you to a more remoued ground:


But doe not goe with it


   Hor.
No, by no meanes
   Ham.
It will not speake: then will I follow it
   Hor.
Doe not my Lord
   Ham.
Why, what should be the feare?
I doe not set my life at a pins fee;


And for my Soule, what can it doe to that?
Being a thing immortall as it selfe:


It waues me forth againe; Ile follow it


   Hor.
What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord?
Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe,


That beetles o're his base into the Sea,


And there assumes some other horrible forme,


Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason,


And draw you into madnesse thinke of it?
Ham.
It wafts me still: goe on, Ile follow thee


   Mar.
You shall not goe my Lord
   Ham.
Hold off your hand
   Hor.
Be rul'd, you shall not goe
   Ham.
My fate cries out,


And makes each petty Artire in this body,


As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue:


Still am I cal'd?
Vnhand me Gentlemen:


By Heau'n, Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me:


I say away, goe on, Ile follow thee.
Exeunt.
Ghost & Hamlet.
Hor.
He waxes desperate with imagination
   Mar.
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him
   Hor.
Haue after, to what issue will this come?
Mar.
Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke


   Hor.
Heauen will direct it
   Mar.
Nay, let's follow him.
Exeunt.
Enter Ghost and Hamlet.
Ham.
Where wilt thou lead me?
speak; Ile go no further
   Gho.
Marke me
   Ham.
I will
   Gho.
My hower is almost come,


When I to sulphurous and tormenting Flames


Must render vp my selfe


   Ham.
Alas poore Ghost
   Gho.
Pitty me not, but lend thy serious hearing


To what I shall vnfold


   Ham.
Speake, I am bound to heare
   Gho.
So art thou to reuenge, when thou shalt heare
   Ham.
What?
Gho.
I am thy Fathers Spirit,


Doom'd for a certaine terme to walke the night;


And for the day confin'd to fast in Fiers,


Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature


Are burnt and purg'd away?
But that I am forbid


To tell the secrets of my Prison-House;


I could a Tale vnfold, whose lightest word


Would harrow vp thy soule, freeze thy young blood,


Make thy two eyes like Starres, start from their Spheres,


Thy knotty and combined lockes to part,


And each particular haire to stand an end,


Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine:


But this eternall blason must not be


To eares of flesh and bloud; list Hamlet, oh list,


If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue


   Ham.
Oh Heauen!
Gho.
Reuenge his foule and most vnnaturall Murther


   Ham.
Murther?
Ghost.
Murther most foule, as in the best it is;


But this most foule, strange, and vnnaturall


   Ham.
Hast, hast me to know it,


That with wings as swift


As meditation, or the thoughts of Loue,


May sweepe to my Reuenge


   Ghost.
I finde thee apt,


And duller should'st thou be then the fat weede


That rots it selfe in ease, on Lethe Wharfe,


Would'st thou not stirre in this.
Now Hamlet heare:


It's giuen out, that sleeping in mine Orchard,


A Serpent stung me: so the whole eare of Denmarke,


Is by a forged processe of my death


Rankly abus'd: But know thou Noble youth,


The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life,


Now weares his Crowne


   Ham.
O my Propheticke soule: mine Vncle?
Ghost.
I that incestuous, that adulterate Beast


With witchcraft of his wits, hath Traitorous guifts.
Oh wicked Wit, and Gifts, that haue the power


So to seduce?
Won to this shamefull Lust


The will of my most seeming vertuous Queene:


Oh Hamlet, what a falling off was there,


From me, whose loue was of that dignity,


That it went hand in hand, euen with the Vow


I made to her in Marriage; and to decline


Vpon a wretch, whose Naturall gifts were poore


To those of mine.
But Vertue, as it neuer wil be moued,


Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of Heauen:


So Lust, though to a radiant Angell link'd,


Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed, & prey on Garbage.
But soft, me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre;


Briefe let me be: Sleeping within mine Orchard,


My custome alwayes in the afternoone;


Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole


With iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl,


And in the Porches of mine eares did poure


The leaperous Distilment; whose effect


Holds such an enmity with bloud of Man,


That swift as Quick-siluer, it courses through


The naturall Gates and Allies of the body;


And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset


And curd, like Aygre droppings into Milke,


The thin and wholsome blood: so did it mine;


And a most instant Tetter bak'd about,


Most Lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,


All my smooth Body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a Brothers hand,


Of Life, of Crowne, and Queene at once dispatcht;


Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne,


Vnhouzzled, disappointed, vnnaneld,


No reckoning made, but sent to my account


With all my imperfections on my head;


Oh horrible Oh horrible, most horrible:


If thou hast nature in thee beare it not;


Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be


A Couch for Luxury and damned Incest.
But howsoeuer thou pursuest this Act,


Taint not thy mind; nor let thy Soule contriue


Against thy Mother ought; leaue her to heauen,


And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge,


To pricke and sting her.
Fare thee well at once;


The Glow-worme showes the Matine to be neere,


And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire:


Adue, adue, Hamlet: remember me.
Enter.
Ham.
Oh all you host of Heauen!
Oh Earth; what els?
And shall I couple Hell?
Oh fie: hold my heart;


And you my sinnewes, grow not instant Old;


But beare me stiffely vp: Remember thee?
I, thou poore Ghost, while memory holds a seate


In this distracted Globe: Remember thee?
Yea, from the Table of my Memory,


Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records,


All sawes of Bookes, all formes, all presures past,


That youth and obseruation coppied there;


And thy Commandment all alone shall liue


Within the Booke and Volume of my Braine,


Vnmixt with baser matter; yes yes, by Heauen:


Oh most pernicious woman!
Oh Villaine, Villaine, smiling damned Villaine!
My Tables, my Tables; meet it is I set it downe,


That one may smile, and smile and be a Villaine;


At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmarke;


So Vnckle there you are: now to my word;


It is; Adue, Adue, Remember me: I haue sworn't


   Hor.
& Mar.
within.
My Lord, my Lord.
Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
Mar.
Lord Hamlet
   Hor.
Heauen secure him
   Mar.
So be it
   Hor.
Illo, ho, ho, my Lord
   Ham.
Hillo, ho, ho, boy; come bird, come
   Mar.
How ist my Noble Lord?
Hor.
What newes, my Lord?
Ham.
Oh wonderfull!
Hor.
Good my Lord tell it


   Ham.
No you'l reueale it
   Hor.
Not I, my Lord, by Heauen
   Mar.
Nor I, my Lord
   Ham.
How say you then, would heart of man once think it?
But you'l be secret?
Both.
I, by Heau'n, my Lord


   Ham.
There's nere a villaine dwelling in all Denmarke


But hee's an arrant knaue


   Hor.
There needs no Ghost my Lord, come from the


Graue, to tell vs this


   Ham.
Why right, you are i'th' right;


And so, without more circumstance at all,


I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part:


You, as your busines and desires shall point you:


For euery man ha's businesse and desire,


Such as it is: and for mine owne poore part,


Looke you, Ile goe pray


   Hor.
These are but wild and hurling words, my Lord
   Ham.
I'm sorry they offend you heartily:


Yes faith, heartily


   Hor.
There's no offence my Lord
   Ham.
Yes, by Saint Patricke, but there is my Lord,


And much offence too, touching this Vision heere:


It is an honest Ghost, that let me tell you:


For your desire to know what is betweene vs,


O'remaster't as you may.
And now good friends,


As you are Friends, Schollers and Soldiers,


Giue me one poore request


   Hor.
What is't my Lord?
we will
   Ham.
Neuer make known what you haue seen to night
   Both.
My Lord, we will not
   Ham.
Nay, but swear't
   Hor.
Infaith my Lord, not I
   Mar.
Nor I my Lord: in faith
   Ham.
Vpon my sword
   Marcell.
We haue sworne my Lord already
   Ham.
Indeed, vpon my sword, Indeed
   Gho.
Sweare.
Ghost cries vnder the Stage.
Ham.
Ah ha boy, sayest thou so.
Art thou there truepenny?
Come one you here this fellow in the selleredge


Consent to sweare


   Hor.
Propose the Oath my Lord
   Ham.
Neuer to speake of this that you haue seene.
Sweare by my sword


   Gho.
Sweare
   Ham.
Hic & vbique?
Then wee'l shift for grownd,


Come hither Gentlemen,


And lay your hands againe vpon my sword,


Neuer to speake of this that you haue heard:


Sweare by my Sword


   Gho.
Sweare
   Ham.
Well said old Mole, can'st worke i'th' ground so fast?
A worthy Pioner, once more remoue good friends


   Hor.
Oh day and night: but this is wondrous strange
   Ham.
And therefore as a stranger giue it welcome.
There are more things in Heauen and Earth, Horatio,


Then are dream't of in our Philosophy.
But come,


Here as before, neuer so helpe you mercy,


How strange or odde so ere I beare my selfe;


(As I perchance heereafter shall thinke meet


To put an Anticke disposition on:)


That you at such time seeing me, neuer shall


With Armes encombred thus, or thus, head shake;


Or by pronouncing of some doubtfull Phrase;


As well, we know, or we could and if we would,


Or if we list to speake; or there be and if there might,


Or such ambiguous giuing out to note,


That you know ought of me; this not to doe:


So grace and mercy at your most neede helpe you:


Sweare


   Ghost.
Sweare
   Ham.
Rest, rest perturbed Spirit: so Gentlemen,


With all my loue I doe commend me to you;


And what so poore a man as Hamlet is,


May doe t' expresse his loue and friending to you,


God willing shall not lacke: let vs goe in together,


And still your fingers on your lippes I pray,


The time is out of ioynt: Oh cursed spight,


That euer I was borne to set it right.
Nay, come let's goe together.
Exeunt.
Actus Secundus.
Enter Polonius, and Reynoldo.
Polon.
Giue him his money, and these notes Reynoldo
   Reynol.
I will my Lord
   Polon.
You shall doe maruels wisely: good Reynoldo,


Before you visite him you make inquiry


Of his behauiour


   Reynol.
My Lord, I did intend it
   Polon.
Marry, well said;


Very well said.
Looke you Sir,


Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;


And how, and who; what meanes; and where they keepe:


What company, at what expence: and finding


By this encompassement and drift of question,


That they doe know my sonne: Come you more neerer


Then your particular demands will touch it,


Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him,


And thus I know his father and his friends,


And in part him.
Doe you marke this Reynoldo?
Reynol.
I, very well my Lord


   Polon.
And in part him, but you may say not well;


But if't be hee I meane, hees very wilde;


Addicted so and so; and there put on him


What forgeries you please; marry, none so ranke,


As may dishonour him; take heed of that:


But Sir, such wanton, wild, and vsuall slips,


As are Companions noted and most knowne


To youth and liberty


   Reynol.
As gaming my Lord
   Polon.
I, or drinking, fencing, swearing,


Quarelling, drabbing.
You may goe so farre


   Reynol.
My Lord that would dishonour him
   Polon.
Faith no, as you may season it in the charge;


You must not put another scandall on him,


That hee is open to Incontinencie;


That's not my meaning: but breath his faults so quaintly,


That they may seeme the taints of liberty;


The flash and out-breake of a fiery minde,


A sauagenes in vnreclaim'd bloud of generall assault


   Reynol.
But my good Lord
   Polon.
Wherefore should you doe this?
Reynol.
I my Lord, I would know that


   Polon.
Marry Sir, heere's my drift,


And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant:


You laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne,


As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i'th' working:


Marke you your party in conuerse; him you would sound,


Hauing euer seene.
In the prenominate crimes,


The youth you breath of guilty, be assur'd


He closes with you in this consequence:


Good sir, or so, or friend, or Gentleman.
According to the Phrase and the Addition,


Of man and Country


   Reynol.
Very good my Lord
   Polon.
And then Sir does he this?
He does: what was I about to say?
I was about say somthing: where did I leaue?
Reynol.
At closes in the consequence:


At friend, or so, and Gentleman


   Polon.
At closes in the consequence, I marry,


He closes with you thus.
I know the Gentleman,


I saw him yesterday, or tother day;


Or then or then, with such and such; and as you say,


There was he gaming, there o'retooke in's Rouse,


There falling out at Tennis; or perchance,


I saw him enter such a house of saile;


Videlicet, a Brothell, or so forth.
See you now;


Your bait of falshood, takes this Cape of truth;


And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach


With windlesses, and with assaies of Bias,


By indirections finde directions out:


So by my former Lecture and aduice


Shall you my Sonne; you haue me, haue you not?
Reynol.
My Lord I haue


   Polon.
God buy you; fare you well
   Reynol.
Good my Lord
   Polon.
Obserue his inclination in your selfe
   Reynol.
I shall my Lord
   Polon.
And let him plye his Musicke
   Reynol.
Well, my Lord.
Enter.
Enter Ophelia.
Polon.
Farewell:


How now Ophelia, what's the matter?
Ophe.
Alas my Lord, I haue beene so affrighted


   Polon.
With what, in the name of Heauen?
Ophe.
My Lord, as I was sowing in my Chamber,


Lord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac'd,


No hat vpon his head, his stockings foul'd,


Vngartred, and downe giued to his Anckle,


Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,


And with a looke so pitious in purport,


As if he had been loosed out of hell,


To speake of horrors: he comes before me


   Polon.
Mad for thy Loue?
Ophe.
My Lord, I doe not know: but truly I do feare it


   Polon.
What said he?
Ophe.
He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard;


Then goes he to the length of all his arme;


And with his other hand thus o're his brow,


He fals to such perusall of my face,


As he would draw it.
Long staid he so,


At last, a little shaking of mine Arme:


And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;


He rais'd a sigh, so pittious and profound,


That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke,


And end his being.
That done, he lets me goe,


And with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd,


He seem'd to finde his way without his eyes,


For out adores he went without their helpe;


And to the last, bended their light on me


   Polon.
Goe with me, I will goe seeke the King,


This is the very extasie of Loue,


Whose violent property foredoes it selfe,


And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings,


As oft as any passion vnder Heauen,


That does afflict our Natures.
I am sorrie,


What haue you giuen him any hard words of late?
Ophe.
No my good Lord: but as you did command,


I did repell his Letters, and deny'de


His accesse to me


   Pol.
That hath made him mad.
I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement


I had not quoted him.
I feare he did but trifle,


And meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:


It seemes it is as proper to our Age,


To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions,


As it is common for the yonger sort


To lacke discretion.
Come, go we to the King,


This must be knowne, being kept close might moue


More greefe to hide, then hate to vtter loue.
Exeunt.
Scena Secunda.
Enter King, Queene, Rosincrane, and Guildensterne Cum alijs.
King.
Welcome deere Rosincrance and Guildensterne.
Moreouer, that we much did long to see you,


The neede we haue to vse you, did prouoke


Our hastie sending.
Something haue you heard


Of Hamlets transformation: so I call it,


Since not th' exterior, nor the inward man


Resembles that it was.
What it should bee


More then his Fathers death, that thus hath put him


So much from th' vnderstanding of himselfe,


I cannot deeme of.
I intreat you both,


That being of so young dayes brought vp with him:


And since so Neighbour'd to his youth, and humour,


That you vouchsafe your rest heere in our Court


Some little time: so by your Companies


To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather


So much as from Occasions you may gleane,


That open'd lies within our remedie


   Qu.
Good Gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,


And sure I am, two men there are not liuing,


To whom he more adheres.
If it will please you


To shew vs so much Gentrie, and good will,


As to expend your time with vs a-while,


For the supply and profit of our Hope,


Your Visitation shall receiue such thankes


As fits a Kings remembrance


   Rosin.
Both your Maiesties


Might by the Soueraigne power you haue of vs,


Put your dread pleasures, more into Command


Then to Entreatie


   Guil.
We both obey,


And here giue vp our selues, in the full bent,


To lay our Seruices freely at your feete,


To be commanded


   King.
Thankes Rosincrance, and gentle Guildensterne
   Qu.
Thankes Guildensterne and gentle Rosincrance.
And I beseech you instantly to visit


My too much changed Sonne.
Go some of ye,


And bring the Gentlemen where Hamlet is


   Guil.
Heauens make our presence and our practises


Pleasant and helpfull to him.
Enter.
Queene.
Amen.
Enter Polonius.
Pol.
Th' Ambassadors from Norwey, my good Lord,


Are ioyfully return'd


   King.
Thou still hast bin the father of good Newes
   Pol.
Haue I, my Lord?
Assure you, my good Liege,


I hold my dutie, as I hold my Soule,


Both to my God, one to my gracious King:


And I do thinke, or else this braine of mine


Hunts not the traile of Policie, so sure


As I haue vs'd to do: that I haue found


The very cause of Hamlets Lunacie


   King.
Oh speake of that, that I do long to heare
   Pol.
Giue first admittance to th' Ambassadors,


My Newes shall be the Newes to that great Feast


   King.
Thy selfe do grace to them, and bring them in.
He tels me my sweet Queene, that he hath found


The head and sourse of all your Sonnes distemper


   Qu.
I doubt it is no other, but the maine,


His Fathers death, and our o're-hasty Marriage.
Enter Polonius, Voltumand, and Cornelius.
King.
Well, we shall sift him.
Welcome good Frends:


Say Voltumand, what from our Brother Norwey?
Volt.
Most faire returne of Greetings, and Desires.
Vpon our first, he sent out to suppresse


His Nephewes Leuies, which to him appear'd


To be a preparation 'gainst the Poleak:


But better look'd into, he truly found


It was against your Highnesse, whereat greeued,


That so his Sicknesse, Age, and Impotence


Was falsely borne in hand, sends out Arrests


On Fortinbras, which he (in breefe) obeyes,


Receiues rebuke from Norwey: and in fine,


Makes Vow before his Vnkle, neuer more


To giue th' assay of Armes against your Maiestie.
Whereon old Norwey, ouercome with ioy,


Giues him three thousand Crownes in Annuall Fee,


And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers


So leuied as before, against the Poleak:


With an intreaty heerein further shewne,


That it might please you to giue quiet passe


Through your Dominions, for his Enterprize,


On such regards of safety and allowance,


As therein are set downe


   King.
It likes vs well:


And at our more consider'd time wee'l read,


Answer, and thinke vpon this Businesse.
Meane time we thanke you, for your well-tooke Labour.
Go to your rest, at night wee'l Feast together.
Most welcome home.
Exit Ambass.
Pol.
This businesse is very well ended.
My Liege, and Madam, to expostulate


What Maiestie should be, what Dutie is,


Why day is day; night, night; and time is time,


Were nothing but to waste Night, Day, and Time.
Therefore, since Breuitie is the Soule of Wit,


And tediousnesse, the limbes and outward flourishes,


I will be breefe.
Your Noble Sonne is mad:


Mad call I it; for to define true Madnesse,


What is't, but to be nothing else but mad.
But let that go


   Qu.
More matter, with lesse Art
   Pol.
Madam, I sweare I vse no Art at all:


That he is mad, 'tis true: 'Tis true 'tis pittie,


And pittie it is true: A foolish figure,


But farewell it: for I will vse no Art.
Mad let vs grant him then: and now remaines


That we finde out the cause of this effect,


Or rather say, the cause of this defect;


For this effect defectiue, comes by cause,


Thus it remaines, and the remainder thus.
Perpend,


I haue a daughter: haue, whil'st she is mine,


Who in her Dutie and Obedience, marke,


Hath giuen me this: now gather, and surmise.
The Letter.
To the Celestiall, and my Soules Idoll, the most beautifed Ophelia.
That's an ill Phrase, a vilde Phrase, beautified is a vilde


Phrase: but you shall heare these in her excellent white


bosome, these


   Qu.
Came this from Hamlet to her
   Pol.
Good Madam stay awhile, I will be faithfull.
Doubt thou, the Starres are fire,


Doubt, that the Sunne doth moue:


Doubt Truth to be a Lier,


But neuer Doubt, I loue.
O deere Ophelia, I am ill at these Numbers: I haue not Art to


reckon my grones; but that I loue thee best, oh most Best beleeue


it.
Adieu.
Thine euermore most deere Lady, whilst this


Machine is to him, Hamlet.
This in Obedience hath my daughter shew'd me:


And more aboue hath his soliciting,


As they fell out by Time, by Meanes, and Place,


All giuen to mine eare


   King.
But how hath she receiu'd his Loue?
Pol.
What do you thinke of me?
King.
As of a man, faithfull and Honourable


   Pol.
I wold faine proue so.
But what might you think?
When I had seene this hot loue on the wing,


As I perceiued it, I must tell you that


Before my Daughter told me what might you


Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere, think,


If I had playd the Deske or Table-booke,


Or giuen my heart a winking, mute and dumbe,


Or look'd vpon this Loue, with idle sight,


What might you thinke?
No, I went round to worke,


And (my yong Mistris) thus I did bespeake


Lord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre,


This must not be: and then, I Precepts gaue her,


That she should locke her selfe from his Resort,


Admit no Messengers, receiue no Tokens:


Which done, she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice,


And he repulsed.
A short Tale to make,


Fell into a Sadnesse, then into a Fast,


Thence to a Watch, thence into a Weaknesse,


Thence to a Lightnesse, and by this declension


Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues,


And all we waile for


   King.
Do you thinke 'tis this?
Qu.
It may be very likely


   Pol.
Hath there bene such a time, I'de fain know that,


That I haue possitiuely said, 'tis so,


When it prou'd otherwise?
King.
Not that I know


   Pol.
Take this from this; if this be otherwise,


If Circumstances leade me, I will finde


Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeede


Within the Center


   King.
How may we try it further?
Pol.
You know sometimes


He walkes foure houres together, heere


In the Lobby


   Qu.
So he ha's indeed
   Pol.
At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him,


Be you and I behinde an Arras then,


Marke the encounter: If he loue her not,


And be not from his reason falne thereon;


Let me be no Assistant for a State,


And keepe a Farme and Carters


   King.
We will try it.
Enter Hamlet reading on a Booke.
Qu.
But looke where sadly the poore wretch


Comes reading


   Pol.
Away I do beseech you, both away,


Ile boord him presently.
Exit King & Queen.
Oh giue me leaue.
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
Ham.
Well, God-a-mercy


   Pol.
Do you know me, my Lord?
Ham.
Excellent, excellent well: y'are a Fishmonger


   Pol.
Not I my Lord
   Ham.
Then I would you were so honest a man
   Pol.
Honest, my Lord?
Ham.
I sir, to be honest as this world goes, is to bee


one man pick'd out of two thousand


   Pol.
That's very true, my Lord
   Ham.
For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge,


being a good kissing Carrion-


Haue you a daughter?
Pol.
I haue my Lord


   Ham.
Let her not walke i'thSunne: Conception is a
blessing, but not as your daughter may conceiue.
Friend
looke too't
   Pol.
How say you by that?
Still harping on my daughter:
yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a Fishmonger:
he is farre gone, farre gone: and truly in my youth,
I suffred much extreamity for loue: very neere this.
Ile
speake to him againe.
What do you read my Lord?
Ham.
Words, words, words
   Pol.
What is the matter, my Lord?
Ham.
Betweene who?
Pol.
I meane the matter you meane, my Lord


   Ham.
Slanders Sir: for the Satyricall slaue saies here,
that old men haue gray Beards; that their faces are wrinkled;
their eyes purging thicke Amber, or Plum-Tree
Gumme: and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit,
together with weake Hammes.
All which Sir, though I
most powerfully, and potently beleeue; yet I holde it
not Honestie to haue it thus set downe: For you your
selfe Sir, should be old as I am, if like a Crab you could
go backward
   Pol.
Though this be madnesse,


Yet there is Method in't: will you walke


Out of the ayre my Lord?
Ham.
Into my Graue?
Pol.
Indeed that is out o'th' Ayre:


How pregnant (sometimes) his Replies are?
A happinesse,


That often Madnesse hits on,


Which Reason and Sanitie could not


So prosperously be deliuer'd of.
I will leaue him,


And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting


Betweene him, and my daughter.
My Honourable Lord, I will most humbly


Take my leaue of you


   Ham.
You cannot Sir take from me any thing, that I
will more willingly part withall, except my life, my
life
   Polon.
Fare you well my Lord
   Ham.
These tedious old fooles
   Polon.
You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet; there


hee is.
Enter Rosincran and Guildensterne.
Rosin.
God saue you Sir
   Guild.
Mine honour'd Lord?
Rosin.
My most deare Lord?
Ham.
My excellent good friends?
How do'st thou


Guildensterne?
Oh, Rosincrane; good Lads: How doe ye


both?
Rosin.
As the indifferent Children of the earth


   Guild.
Happy, in that we are not ouer-happy: on Fortunes


Cap, we are not the very Button


   Ham.
Nor the Soales of her Shoo?
Rosin.
Neither my Lord


   Ham.
Then you liue about her waste, or in the middle


of her fauour?
Guil.
Faith, her priuates, we


   Ham.
In the secret parts of Fortune?
Oh, most true:


she is a Strumpet.
What's the newes?
Rosin.
None my Lord; but that the World's growne


honest


   Ham.
Then is Doomesday neere: But your newes is


not true.
Let me question more in particular: what haue


you my good friends, deserued at the hands of Fortune,


that she sends you to Prison hither?
Guil.
Prison, my Lord?
Ham.
Denmark's a Prison


   Rosin.
Then is the World one
   Ham.
A goodly one, in which there are many Confines,
Wards, and Dungeons; Denmarke being one o'th'
worst
   Rosin.
We thinke not so my Lord
   Ham.
Why then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is
a prison
   Rosin.
Why then your Ambition makes it one: 'tis
too narrow for your minde
   Ham.
O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and
count my selfe a King of infinite space; were it not that
I haue bad dreames
   Guil.
Which dreames indeed are Ambition: for the
very substance of the Ambitious, is meerely the shadow
of a Dreame
   Ham.
A dreame it selfe is but a shadow
   Rosin.
Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry and


light a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow


   Ham.
Then are our Beggers bodies; and our Monarchs


and out-stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes:


shall wee to th' Court: for, by my fey I cannot reason?
Both.
Wee'l wait vpon you


   Ham.
No such matter.
I will not sort you with the
rest of my seruants: for to speake to you like an honest
man: I am most dreadfully attended; but in the beaten
way of friendship, What make you at Elsonower?
Rosin.
To visit you my Lord, no other occasion
   Ham.
Begger that I am, I am euen poore in thankes;
but I thanke you: and sure deare friends my thanks
are too deare a halfepeny; were you not sent for?
Is it
your owne inclining?
Is it a free visitation?
Come,
deale iustly with me: come, come; nay speake
   Guil.
What should we say my Lord?
Ham.
Why any thing.
But to the purpose; you were
sent for; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes;
which your modesties haue not craft enough to color,
I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you
   Rosin.
To what end my Lord?
Ham.
That you must teach me: but let mee coniure
you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
our youth, by the Obligation of our euer-preserued loue,
and by what more deare, a better proposer could charge
you withall; be euen and direct with me, whether you
were sent for or no
   Rosin.
What say you?
Ham.
Nay then I haue an eye of you: if you loue me


hold not off


   Guil.
My Lord, we were sent for
   Ham.
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and
Queene: moult no feather, I haue of late, but wherefore
I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custome of exercise;
and indeed, it goes so heauenly with my disposition;
that this goodly frame the Earth, seemes to me a sterrill
Promontory; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre,
look you, this braue ore-hanging, this Maiesticall Roofe,
fretted with golden fire: why, it appeares no other thing
to mee, then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours.
What a piece of worke is a man!
how Noble in
Reason?
how infinite in faculty?
in forme and mouing
how expresse and admirable?
in Action, how like an Angel?
in apprehension, how like a God?
the beauty of the
world, the Parragon of Animals; and yet to me, what is
this Quintessence of Dust?
Man delights not me; no,
nor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seeme
to say so
   Rosin.
My Lord, there was no such stuffe in my
thoughts
   Ham.
Why did you laugh, when I said, Man delights
not me?
Rosin.
To thinke, my Lord, if you delight not in Man,
what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue
from you: wee coated them on the way, and hither are
they comming to offer you Seruice
   Ham.
He that playes the King shall be welcome; his
Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee: the aduenturous
Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target: the Louer shall
not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in
peace: the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs
are tickled a'th' sere: and the Lady shall say her minde
freely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't: what Players
are they?
Rosin.
Euen those you were wont to take delight in
the Tragedians of the City
   Ham.
How chances it they trauaile?
their residence
both in reputation and profit was better both
wayes
   Rosin.
I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes


of the late Innouation?
Ham.
Doe they hold the same estimation they did


when I was in the City?
Are they so follow'd?
Rosin.
No indeed, they are not


   Ham.
How comes it?
doe they grow rusty?
Rosin.
Nay, their indeauour keepes in the wonted
pace; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children, little
Yases, that crye out on the top of question; and
are most tyrannically clap't for't: these are now the
fashion, and so be-ratled the common Stages (so they
call them) that many wearing Rapiers, are affraide of
Goose-quils, and dare scarse come thither
   Ham.
What are they Children?
Who maintains 'em?
How are they escorted?
Will they pursue the Quality no
longer then they can sing?
Will they not say afterwards
if they should grow themselues to common Players (as
it is most like if their meanes are not better) their Writers
do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their
owne Succession
   Rosin.
Faith there ha's bene much to do on both sides:
and the Nation holds it no sinne, to tarre them to Controuersie.
There was for a while, no mony bid for argument,
vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in
the Question
   Ham.
Is't possible?
Guild.
Oh there ha's beene much throwing about of


Braines


   Ham.
Do the Boyes carry it away?
Rosin.
I that they do my Lord.
Hercules & his load too


   Ham.
It is not strange: for mine Vnckle is King of
Denmarke, and those that would make mowes at him
while my Father liued; giue twenty, forty, an hundred
Ducates a peece, for his picture in Little.
There is something
in this more then Naturall, if Philosophie could
finde it out.
Flourish for the Players.
Guil.
There are the Players
   Ham.
Gentlemen, you are welcom to Elsonower: your
hands, come: The appurtenance of Welcome, is Fashion
and Ceremony.
Let me comply with you in the Garbe,
lest my extent to the Players (which I tell you must shew
fairely outward) should more appeare like entertainment
then yours.
You are welcome: but my Vnckle Father,
and Aunt Mother are deceiu'd
   Guil.
In what my deere Lord?
Ham.
I am but mad North, North-West: when the


Winde is Southerly, I know a Hawke from a Handsaw.
Enter Polonius.
Pol.
Well be with you Gentlemen
   Ham.
Hearke you Guildensterne, and you too: at each
eare a hearer: that great Baby you see there, is not yet
out of his swathing clouts
   Rosin.
Happily he's the second time come to them: for
they say, an old man is twice a childe
   Ham.
I will Prophesie.
Hee comes to tell me of the
Players.
Mark it, you say right Sir: for a Monday morning
'twas so indeed
   Pol.
My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you
   Ham.
My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you.
When Rossius an Actor in Rome-


  Pol.
The Actors are come hither my Lord


   Ham.
Buzze, buzze
   Pol.
Vpon mine Honor
   Ham.
Then can each Actor on his Asse-
  Polon.
The best Actors in the world, either for Tragedie,
Comedie, Historie, Pastorall:
Pastoricall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:
Tragicall-Historicall: Tragicall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:
Scene indiuidible: or Poem
vnlimited.
Seneca cannot be too heauy, nor Plautus
too light, for the law of Writ, and the Liberty.
These are
the onely men
   Ham.
O Iephta Iudge of Israel, what a Treasure had'st


thou?
Pol.
What a Treasure had he, my Lord?
Ham.
Why one faire Daughter, and no more,


The which he loued passing well


   Pol.
Still on my Daughter
   Ham.
Am I not i'th' right old Iephta?
Polon.
If you call me Iephta my Lord, I haue a daughter


that I loue passing well


   Ham.
Nay that followes not
   Polon.
What followes then, my Lord?
Ha.
Why, As by lot, God wot: and then you know, It


came to passe, as most like it was: The first rowe of the


Pons Chanson will shew you more.
For looke where my


Abridgements come.
Enter foure or fiue Players.
Y'are welcome Masters, welcome all.
I am glad to see
thee well: Welcome good Friends.
Oh my olde Friend?
Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last: Com'st thou to
beard me in Denmarke?
What, my yong Lady and Mistris?
Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then when
I saw you last, by the altitude of a Choppine.
Pray God
your voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack'd
within the ring.
Masters, you are all welcome: wee'l e'ne
to't like French Faulconers, flie at any thing we see: wee'l
haue a Speech straight.
Come giue vs a tast of your quality:
come, a passionate speech
   1.Play.
What speech, my Lord?
Ham.
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
neuer Acted: or if it was, not aboue once, for the Play I
remember pleas'd not the Million, 'twas Cauiarie to the
Generall: but it was (as I receiu'd it, and others, whose
iudgement in such matters, cried in the top of mine) an
excellent Play; well digested in the Scoenes, set downe
with as much modestie, as cunning.
I remember one said,
there was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter sauory;
nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite the
Author of affectation, but cal'd it an honest method.
One
cheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lou'd, 'twas Aeneas Tale
to Dido, and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks
of Priams slaughter.
If it liue in your memory, begin at
this Line, let me see, let me see: The rugged Pyrrhus like
th'Hyrcanian Beast.
It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus
The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose Sable Armes
Blacke as his purpose, did the night resemble
When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse,
Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd
With Heraldry more dismall: Head to foote
Now is he to take Geulles, horridly Trick'd
With blood of Fathers, Mothers, Daughters, Sonnes,
Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
That lend a tyrannous, and damned light
To their vilde Murthers, roasted in wrath and fire,
And thus o're-sized with coagulate gore,
With eyes like Carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
Olde Grandsire Priam seekes
   Pol.
Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good accent,


and good discretion


   1.Player.
Anon he findes him,


Striking too short at Greekes.
His anticke Sword,


Rebellious to his Arme, lyes where it falles


Repugnant to command: vnequall match,


Pyrrhus at Priam driues, in Rage strikes wide:


But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword,


Th' vnnerued Father fals.
Then senselesse Illium,


Seeming to feele his blow, with flaming top


Stoopes to his Bace, and with a hideous crash


Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare.
For loe, his Sword


Which was declining on the Milkie head


Of Reuerend Priam, seem'd i'th' Ayre to sticke:


So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood,


And like a Newtrall to his will and matter, did nothing.
But as we often see against some storme,


A silence in the Heauens, the Racke stand still,


The bold windes speechlesse, and the Orbe below


As hush as death: Anon the dreadfull Thunder


Doth rend the Region.
So after Pyrrhus pause,


A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a-worke,


And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall


On Mars his Armours, forg'd for proofe Eterne,


With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword


Now falles on Priam.
Out, out, thou Strumpet-Fortune, all you Gods,


In generall Synod take away her power:


Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele,


And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen,


As low as to the Fiends


   Pol.
This is too long
   Ham.
It shall to'th Barbars, with your beard.
Prythee
say on: He's for a Iigge, or a tale of Baudry, or hee
sleepes.
Say on; come to Hecuba
   1.Play.
But who, O who, had seen the inobled Queen
   Ham.
The inobled Queene?
Pol.
That's good: Inobled Queene is good


   1.Play.
Run bare-foot vp and downe,


Threatning the flame


With Bisson Rheume: A clout about that head,


Where late the Diadem stood, and for a Robe


About her lanke and all ore-teamed Loines,


A blanket in th' Alarum of feare caught vp.
Who this had seene, with tongue in Venome steep'd,


'Gainst Fortunes State, would Treason haue pronounc'd?
But if the Gods themselues did see her then,


When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport


In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes,


The instant Burst of Clamour that she made


(Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all)


Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen,


And passion in the Gods


   Pol.
Looke where he ha's not turn'd his colour, and


ha's teares in's eyes.
Pray you no more


   Ham.
'Tis well, Ile haue thee speake out the rest,
soone.
Good my Lord, will you see the Players wel bestow'd.
Do ye heare, let them be well vs'd: for they are
the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time.
After
your death, you were better haue a bad Epitaph, then
their ill report while you liued
   Pol.
My Lord, I will vse them according to their desart
   Ham.
Gods bodykins man, better.
Vse euerie man
after his desart, and who should scape whipping: vse
them after your own Honor and Dignity.
The lesse they
deserue, the more merit is in your bountie.
Take them
in
   Pol.
Come sirs.
Exit Polon.
Ham.
Follow him Friends: wee'l heare a play to morrow.
Dost thou heare me old Friend, can you play the


murther of Gonzago?
Play.
I my Lord


   Ham.
Wee'l ha't to morrow night.
You could for a


need study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines, which


I would set downe, and insert in't?
Could ye not?
Play.
I my Lord


   Ham.
Very well.
Follow that Lord, and looke you


mock him not.
My good Friends, Ile leaue you til night


you are welcome to Elsonower?
Rosin.
Good my Lord.
Exeunt.
Manet Hamlet.
Ham.
I so, God buy'ye: Now I am alone.
Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I?
Is it not monstrous that this Player heere,


But in a Fixion, in a dreame of Passion,


Could force his soule so to his whole conceit,


That from her working, all his visage warm'd;


Teares in his eyes, distraction in's Aspect,


A broken voyce, and his whole Function suiting


With Formes, to his Conceit?
And all for nothing?
For Hecuba?
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,


That he should weepe for her?
What would he doe,


Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion


That I haue?
He would drowne the Stage with teares,


And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech:


Make mad the guilty, and apale the free,


Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,


The very faculty of Eyes and Eares.
Yet I,


A dull and muddy-metled Rascall, peake


Like Iohn a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cause,


And can say nothing: No, not for a King,


Vpon whose property, and most deere life,


A damn'd defeate was made.
Am I a Coward?
Who calles me Villaine?
breakes my pate a-crosse?
Pluckes off my Beard, and blowes it in my face?
Tweakes me by'th' Nose?
giues me the Lye i'th' Throate,


As deepe as to the Lungs?
Who does me this?
Ha?
Why I should take it: for it cannot be,


But I am Pigeon-Liuer'd, and lacke Gall


To make Oppression bitter, or ere this,


I should haue fatted all the Region Kites


With this Slaues Offall, bloudy: a Bawdy villaine,


Remorselesse, Treacherous, Letcherous, kindles villaine!
Oh Vengeance!
Who?
What an Asse am I?
I sure, this is most braue,


That I, the Sonne of the Deere murthered,


Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen, and Hell,


Must (like a Whore) vnpacke my heart with words,


And fall a Cursing like a very Drab.
A Scullion?
Fye vpon't: Foh.
About my Braine.
I haue heard, that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play,


Haue by the very cunning of the Scoene,


Bene strooke so to the soule, that presently


They haue proclaim'd their Malefactions.
For Murther, though it haue no tongue, will speake


With most myraculous Organ.
Ile haue these Players,


Play something like the murder of my Father,


Before mine Vnkle.
Ile obserue his lookes,


Ile rent him to the quicke: If he but blench


I know my course.
The Spirit that I haue seene


May be the Diuell, and the Diuel hath power


T' assume a pleasing shape, yea and perhaps


Out of my Weaknesse, and my Melancholly,


As he is very potent with such Spirits,


Abuses me to damne me.
Ile haue grounds


More Relatiue then this: The Play's the thing,


Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King.
Exit
Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,


Guildenstern, and


Lords.
King.
And can you by no drift of circumstance


Get from him why he puts on this Confusion:


Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet


With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy


   Rosin.
He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted,


But from what cause he will by no meanes speake


   Guil.
Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded,


But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe:


When we would bring him on to some Confession


Of his true state


   Qu.
Did he receiue you well?
Rosin.
Most like a Gentleman


   Guild.
But with much forcing of his disposition
   Rosin.
Niggard of question, but of our demands


Most free in his reply


   Qu.
Did you assay him to any pastime?
Rosin.
Madam, it so fell out, that certaine Players


We ore-wrought on the way: of these we told him,


And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy


To heare of it: They are about the Court,


And (as I thinke) they haue already order


This night to play before him


   Pol.
'Tis most true:


And he beseech'd me to intreate your Maiesties


To heare, and see the matter


   King.
With all my heart, and it doth much content me


To heare him so inclin'd.
Good Gentlemen,


Giue him a further edge, and driue his purpose on


To these delights


   Rosin.
We shall my Lord.
Exeunt.
King.
Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too,


For we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither,


That he, as 'twere by accident, may there


Affront Ophelia.
Her Father, and my selfe (lawful espials)


Will so bestow our selues, that seeing vnseene


We may of their encounter frankely iudge,


And gather by him, as he is behaued,


If't be th' affliction of his loue, or no.
That thus he suffers for


   Qu.
I shall obey you,


And for your part Ophelia, I do wish


That your good Beauties be the happy cause


Of Hamlets wildenesse: so shall I hope your Vertues


Will bring him to his wonted way againe,


To both your Honors


   Ophe.
Madam, I wish it may
   Pol.
Ophelia, walke you heere.
Gracious so please ye


We will bestow our selues: Reade on this booke,


That shew of such an exercise may colour


Your lonelinesse.
We are oft too blame in this,


'Tis too much prou'd, that with Deuotions visage,


And pious Action, we do surge o're


The diuell himselfe


   King.
Oh 'tis true:


How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience?
The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist'ring Art


Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it,


Then is my deede, to my most painted word.
Oh heauie burthen!
Pol.
I heare him comming, let's withdraw my Lord.
Exeunt.
Enter Hamlet.
Ham.
To be, or not to be, that is the Question:


Whether 'tis Nobler in the minde to suffer


The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,


Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,


And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe


No more; and by a sleepe, to say we end


The Heart-ake, and the thousand Naturall shockes


That Flesh is heyre too?
'Tis a consummation


Deuoutly to be wish'd.
To dye to sleepe,


To sleepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there's the rub,


For in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come,


When we haue shuffel'd off this mortall coile,


Must giue vs pawse.
There's the respect


That makes Calamity of so long life:


For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,


The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,


The pangs of dispriz'd Loue, the Lawes delay,


The insolence of Office, and the Spurnes


That patient merit of the vnworthy takes,


When he himselfe might his Quietus make


With a bare Bodkin?
Who would these Fardles beare


To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life,


But that the dread of something after death,


The vndiscouered Countrey, from whose Borne


No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,


And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,


Then flye to others that we know not of.
Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all,


And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution


Is sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thought,


And enterprizes of great pith and moment,


With this regard their Currants turne away,


And loose the name of Action.
Soft you now,


The faire Ophelia?
Nimph, in thy Orizons


Be all my sinnes remembred


   Ophe.
Good my Lord,


How does your Honor for this many a day?
Ham.
I humbly thanke you: well, well, well


   Ophe.
My Lord, I haue Remembrances of yours,


That I haue longed long to re-deliuer.
I pray you now, receiue them


   Ham.
No, no, I neuer gaue you ought
   Ophe.
My honor'd Lord, I know right well you did,


And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd,


As made the things more rich, then perfume left:


Take these againe, for to the Noble minde


Rich gifts wax poore, when giuers proue vnkinde.
There my Lord


   Ham.
Ha, ha: Are you honest?
Ophe.
My Lord


   Ham.
Are you faire?
Ophe.
What meanes your Lordship?
Ham.
That if you be honest and faire, your Honesty


should admit no discourse to your Beautie


   Ophe.
Could Beautie my Lord, haue better Comerce
then your Honestie?
Ham.
I trulie: for the power of Beautie, will sooner
transforme Honestie from what is, to a Bawd, then the
force of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse.
This was sometime a Paradox, but now the time giues it
proofe.
I did loue you once
   Ophe.
Indeed my Lord, you made me beleeue so
   Ham.
You should not haue beleeued me.
For vertue
cannot so innocculate our old stocke, but we shall rellish
of it.
I loued you not
   Ophe.
I was the more deceiued
   Ham.
Get thee to a Nunnerie.
Why would'st thou
be a breeder of Sinners?
I am my selfe indifferent honest,
but yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were better
my Mother had not borne me.
I am very prowd, reuengefull,
Ambitious, with more offences at my becke,
then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination, to giue
them shape, or time to acte them in.
What should such
Fellowes as I do, crawling betweene Heauen and Earth.
We are arrant Knaues all, beleeue none of vs. Goe thy
wayes to a Nunnery.
Where's your Father?
Ophe.
At home, my Lord
   Ham.
Let the doores be shut vpon him, that he may
play the Foole no way, but in's owne house.
Farewell
   Ophe.
O helpe him, you sweet Heauens
   Ham.
If thou doest Marry, Ile giue thee this Plague
for thy Dowrie.
Be thou as chast as Ice, as pure as Snow,
thou shalt not escape Calumny.
Get thee to a Nunnery.
Go, Farewell.
Or if thou wilt needs Marry, marry a fool:
for Wise men know well enough, what monsters you
make of them.
To a Nunnery go, and quickly too.
Farwell
   Ophe.
O heauenly Powers, restore him
   Ham.
I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough.
God has giuen you one pace, and you make your selfe another:
you gidge, you amble, and you lispe, and nickname
Gods creatures, and make your Wantonnesse, your Ignorance.
Go too, Ile no more on't, it hath made me mad.
I say, we will haue no more Marriages.
Those that are
married already, all but one shall liue, the rest shall keep
as they are.
To a Nunnery, go.
Exit Hamlet.
Ophe.
O what a Noble minde is heere o're-throwne?
The Courtiers, Soldiers, Schollers: Eye, tongue, sword,


Th' expectansie and Rose of the faire State,


The glasse of Fashion, and the mould of Forme,


Th' obseru'd of all Obseruers, quite, quite downe.
Haue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched,


That suck'd the Honie of his Musicke Vowes:


Now see that Noble, and most Soueraigne Reason,


Like sweet Bels iangled out of tune, and harsh,


That vnmatch'd Forme and Feature of blowne youth,


Blasted with extasie.
Oh woe is me,


T'haue seene what I haue seene: see what I see.
Enter King, and Polonius.
King.
Loue?
His affections do not that way tend,


Nor what he spake, though it lack'd Forme a little,


Was not like Madnesse.
There's something in his soule?
O're which his Melancholly sits on brood,


And I do doubt the hatch, and the disclose


Will be some danger, which to preuent


I haue in quicke determination


Thus set it downe.
He shall with speed to England


For the demand of our neglected Tribute:


Haply the Seas and Countries different


With variable Obiects, shall expell


This something setled matter in his heart:


Whereon his Braines still beating, puts him thus


From fashion of himselfe.
What thinke you on't?
Pol.
It shall do well.
But yet do I beleeue


The Origin and Commencement of this greefe


Sprung from neglected loue.
How now Ophelia?
You neede not tell vs, what Lord Hamlet saide,


We heard it all.
My Lord, do as you please,


But if you hold it fit after the Play,


Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him


To shew his Greefes: let her be round with him,


And Ile be plac'd so, please you in the eare


Of all their Conference.
If she finde him not,


To England send him: Or confine him where


Your wisedome best shall thinke


   King.
It shall be so:


Madnesse in great Ones, must not vnwatch'd go.
Exeunt.
Enter Hamlet, and two or three of the Players.
Ham.
Speake the Speech I pray you, as I pronounc'd
it to you trippingly on the Tongue: But if you mouth it,
as many of your Players do, I had as liue the Town-Cryer
had spoke my Lines: Nor do not saw the Ayre too much
your hand thus, but vse all gently; for in the verie Torrent,
Tempest, and (as I say) the Whirle-winde of
Passion, you must acquire and beget a Temperance that
may giue it Smoothnesse.
O it offends mee to the Soule,
to see a robustious Pery-wig-pated Fellow, teare a Passion
to tatters, to verie ragges, to split the eares of the
Groundlings: who (for the most part) are capeable of
nothing, but inexplicable dumbe shewes, & noise: I could
haue such a Fellow whipt for o're-doing Termagant: it
outHerod's Herod.
Pray you auoid it
   Player.
I warrant your Honor
   Ham.
Be not too tame neyther: but let your owne
Discretion be your Tutor.
Sute the Action to the Word,
the Word to the Action, with this speciall obseruance:
That you ore-stop not the modestie of Nature; for any
thing so ouer-done, is fro[m] the purpose of Playing, whose
end both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twer
the Mirrour vp to Nature; to shew Vertue her owne
Feature, Scorne her owne Image, and the verie Age and
Bodie of the Time, his forme and pressure.
Now, this
ouer-done, or come tardie off, though it make the vnskilfull
laugh, cannot but make the Iudicious greeue; The
censure of the which One, must in your allowance o'reway
a whole Theater of Others.
Oh, there bee Players
that I haue seene Play, and heard others praise, and that
highly (not to speake it prophanely) that neyther hauing
the accent of Christians, nor the gate of Christian, Pagan,
or Norman, haue so strutted and bellowed, that I haue
thought some of Natures Iouerney-men had made men,
and not made them well, they imitated Humanity so abhominably
   Play.
I hope we haue reform'd that indifferently with
vs, Sir
   Ham.
O reforme it altogether.
And let those that
play your Clownes, speake no more then is set downe for
them.
For there be of them, that will themselues laugh,
to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh
too, though in the meane time, some necessary Question
of the Play be then to be considered: that's Villanous, &
shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses
it.
Go make you readie.
Exit Players.
Enter Polonius, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne.
How now my Lord,


Will the King heare this peece of Worke?
Pol.
And the Queene too, and that presently


   Ham.
Bid the Players make hast.
Exit Polonius.
Will you two helpe to hasten them?
Both.
We will my Lord.
Exeunt.
Enter Horatio.
Ham.
What hoa, Horatio?
Hora.
Heere sweet Lord, at your Seruice


   Ham.
Horatio, thou art eene as iust a man


As ere my Conuersation coap'd withall


   Hora.
O my deere Lord
   Ham.
Nay, do not thinke I flatter:


For what aduancement may I hope from thee,


That no Reuennew hast, but thy good spirits


To feed & cloath thee.
Why shold the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the Candied tongue, like absurd pompe,


And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee,


Where thrift may follow faining?
Dost thou heare,


Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse,


And could of men distinguish, her election


Hath seal'd thee for her selfe.
For thou hast bene


As one in suffering all, that suffers nothing.
A man that Fortunes buffets, and Rewards


Hath 'tane with equall Thankes.
And blest are those,


Whose Blood and Iudgement are so well co-mingled,


That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger.
To sound what stop she please.
Giue me that man,


That is not Passions Slaue, and I will weare him


In my hearts Core.
I, in my Heart of heart,


As I do thee.
Something too much of this.
There is a Play to night to before the King.
One Scoene of it comes neere the Circumstance


Which I haue told thee, of my Fathers death.
I prythee, when thou see'st that Acte a-foot,


Euen with the verie Comment of my Soule


Obserue mine Vnkle: If his occulted guilt,


Do not it selfe vnkennell in one speech,


It is a damned Ghost that we haue seene:


And my Imaginations are as foule


As Vulcans Stythe.
Giue him needfull note,


For I mine eyes will riuet to his Face:


And after we will both our iudgements ioyne,


To censure of his seeming


   Hora.
Well my Lord.
If he steale ought the whil'st this Play is Playing,


And scape detecting, I will pay the Theft.
Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,


Guildensterne, and


other Lords attendant with his Guard carrying Torches.
Danish


March.
Sound


a Flourish.
Ham.
They are comming to the Play: I must be idle.
Get you a place


   King.
How fares our Cosin Hamlet?
Ham.
Excellent Ifaith, of the Camelions dish: I eate


the Ayre promise-cramm'd, you cannot feed Capons so


   King.
I haue nothing with this answer Hamlet, these


words are not mine


   Ham.
No, nor mine.
Now my Lord, you plaid once


i'th' Vniuersity, you say?
Polon.
That I did my Lord, and was accounted a good


Actor


   Ham.
And what did you enact?
Pol.
I did enact Iulius Caesar, I was kill'd i'th' Capitol:


Brutus kill'd me


   Ham.
It was a bruite part of him, to kill so Capitall a


Calfe there.
Be the Players ready?
Rosin.
I my Lord, they stay vpon your patience


   Qu.
Come hither my good Hamlet, sit by me
   Ha.
No good Mother, here's Mettle more attractiue
   Pol.
Oh ho, do you marke that?
Ham.
Ladie, shall I lye in your Lap?
Ophe.
No my Lord


   Ham.
I meane, my Head vpon your Lap?
Ophe.
I my Lord


   Ham.
Do you thinke I meant Country matters?
Ophe.
I thinke nothing, my Lord


   Ham.
That's a faire thought to ly betweene Maids legs


  Ophe.
What is my Lord?
Ham.
Nothing


   Ophe.
You are merrie, my Lord?
Ham.
Who I?
Ophe.
I my Lord


   Ham.
Oh God, your onely Iigge-maker: what should
a man do, but be merrie.
For looke you how cheerefully
my Mother lookes, and my Father dyed within's two
Houres
   Ophe.
Nay, 'tis twice two moneths, my Lord
   Ham.
So long?
Nay then let the Diuel weare blacke,
for Ile haue a suite of Sables.
Oh Heauens!
dye two moneths
ago, and not forgotten yet?
Then there's hope, a
great mans Memorie, may out-liue his life halfe a yeare:
But byrlady he must builde Churches then: or else shall
he suffer not thinking on, with the Hoby-horsse, whose
Epitaph is, For o, For o, the Hoby-horse is forgot.
Hoboyes play.
The dumbe shew enters.
Enter a King and Queene, very louingly; the Queene embracing


him.
She


kneeles, and makes shew of Protestation vnto him.
He takes her


vp, and


declines his head vpon her neck.
Layes him downe vpon a Banke


of Flowers.
She seeing him a-sleepe, leaues him.
Anon comes in a Fellow,


takes off his


Crowne, kisses it, and powres poyson in the Kings eares, and


Exits.
The


Queene returnes, findes the King dead, and makes passionate


Action.
The


Poysoner, with some two or three Mutes comes in againe, seeming


to lament


with her.
The dead body is carried away: The Poysoner Wooes the


Queene with


Gifts, she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile, but in the end,


accepts his


loue.
Exeunt.
Ophe.
What meanes this, my Lord?
Ham.
Marry this is Miching Malicho, that meanes


Mischeefe


   Ophe.
Belike this shew imports the Argument of the


Play?
Ham.
We shall know by these Fellowes: the Players


cannot keepe counsell, they'l tell all


   Ophe.
Will they tell vs what this shew meant?
Ham.
I, or any shew that you'l shew him.
Bee not


you asham'd to shew, hee'l not shame to tell you what it


meanes


   Ophe.
You are naught, you are naught, Ile marke the


Play.
Enter Prologue.
For vs, and for our Tragedie,


Heere stooping to your Clemencie:


We begge your hearing Patientlie


   Ham.
Is this a Prologue, or the Poesie of a Ring?
Ophe.
'Tis briefe my Lord


   Ham.
As Womans loue.
Enter King and his Queene.
King.
Full thirtie times hath Phoebus Cart gon round,


Neptunes salt Wash, and Tellus Orbed ground:


And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene,


About the World haue times twelue thirties beene,


Since loue our hearts, and Hymen did our hands


Vnite comutuall, in most sacred Bands


   Bap.
So many iournies may the Sunne and Moone


Make vs againe count o're, ere loue be done.
But woe is me, you are so sicke of late,


So farre from cheere, and from your former state,


That I distrust you: yet though I distrust,


Discomfort you (my Lord) it nothing must:


For womens Feare and Loue, holds quantitie,


In neither ought, or in extremity:


Now what my loue is, proofe hath made you know,


And as my Loue is siz'd, my Feare is so


   King.
Faith I must leaue thee Loue, and shortly too:


My operant Powers my Functions leaue to do:


And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde,


Honour'd, belou'd, and haply, one as kinde.
For Husband shalt thou-


  Bap.
Oh confound the rest:


Such Loue, must needs be Treason in my brest:


In second Husband, let me be accurst,


None wed the second, but who kill'd the first


   Ham.
Wormwood, Wormwood
   Bapt.
The instances that second Marriage moue,


Are base respects of Thrift, but none of Loue.
A second time, I kill my Husband dead,


When second Husband kisses me in Bed


   King.
I do beleeue you.
Think what now you speak:


But what we do determine, oft we breake:


Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie,


Of violent Birth, but poore validitie:


Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree,


But fall vnshaken, when they mellow bee.
Most necessary 'tis, that we forget


To pay our selues, what to our selues is debt:


What to our selues in passion we propose,


The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of other Greefe or Ioy,


Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy:


Where Ioy most Reuels, Greefe doth most lament;


Greefe ioyes, Ioy greeues on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange


That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change.
For 'tis a question left vs yet to proue,


Whether Loue lead Fortune, or else Fortune Loue.
The great man downe, you marke his fauourites flies,


The poore aduanc'd, makes Friends of Enemies:


And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend,


For who not needs, shall neuer lacke a Frend:


And who in want a hollow Friend doth try,


Directly seasons him his Enemie.
But orderly to end, where I begun,


Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run,


That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne,


Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our owne.
So thinke thou wilt no second Husband wed.
But die thy thoughts, when thy first Lord is dead


   Bap.
Nor Earth to giue me food, nor Heauen light,


Sport and repose locke from me day and night:


Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy,


Meet what I would haue well, and it destroy:


Both heere, and hence, pursue me lasting strife,


If once a Widdow, euer I be Wife


   Ham.
If she should breake it now
   King.
'Tis deepely sworne:


Sweet, leaue me heere a while,


My spirits grow dull, and faine I would beguile


The tedious day with sleepe


   Qu.
Sleepe rocke thy Braine,
Sleepes
And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine.
Exit
  Ham.
Madam, how like you this Play?
Qu.
The Lady protests to much me thinkes


   Ham.
Oh but shee'l keepe her word
   King.
Haue you heard the Argument, is there no Offence


in't?
Ham.
No, no, they do but iest, poyson in iest, no Offence


i'th' world


   King.
What do you call the Play?
Ham.
The Mouse-trap: Marry how?
Tropically:
This Play is the Image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago
is the Dukes name, his wife Baptista: you shall see
anon: 'tis a knauish peece of worke: But what o'that?
Your Maiestie, and wee that haue free soules, it touches
vs not: let the gall'd iade winch: our withers are vnrung.
Enter Lucianus.
This is one Lucianus nephew to the King
   Ophe.
You are a good Chorus, my Lord
   Ham.
I could interpret betweene you and your loue:
if I could see the Puppets dallying
   Ophe.
You are keene my Lord, you are keene
   Ham.
It would cost you a groaning, to take off my
edge
   Ophe.
Still better and worse
   Ham.
So you mistake Husbands.
Begin Murderer.
Pox, leaue thy damnable Faces, and
begin.
Come, the croaking Rauen doth bellow for Reuenge
   Lucian.
Thoughts blacke, hands apt,


Drugges fit, and Time agreeing:


Confederate season, else, no Creature seeing:


Thou mixture ranke, of Midnight Weeds collected,


With Hecats Ban, thrice blasted, thrice infected,


Thy naturall Magicke, and dire propertie,


On wholsome life, vsurpe immediately.
Powres the poyson in his eares.
Ham.
He poysons him i'th' Garden for's estate: His
name's Gonzago: the Story is extant and writ in choyce
Italian.
You shall see anon how the Murtherer gets the
loue of Gonzago's wife
   Ophe.
The King rises
   Ham.
What, frighted with false fire
   Qu.
How fares my Lord?
Pol.
Giue o're the Play


   King.
Giue me some Light.
Away
   All.
Lights, Lights, Lights.
Exeunt.
Manet Hamlet & Horatio.
Ham.
Why let the strucken Deere go weepe,


The Hart vngalled play:


For some must watch, while some must sleepe;


So runnes the world away.
Would not this Sir, and a Forrest of Feathers, if the rest of


my Fortunes turne Turke with me; with two Prouinciall


Roses on my rac'd Shooes, get me a Fellowship in a crie


of Players sir


   Hor.
Halfe a share
   Ham.
A whole one I,


For thou dost know: Oh Damon deere,


This Realme dismantled was of Ioue himselfe,


And now reignes heere.
A verie verie Paiocke


   Hora.
You might haue Rim'd
   Ham.
Oh good Horatio, Ile take the Ghosts word for


a thousand pound.
Did'st perceiue?
Hora.
Verie well my Lord


   Ham.
Vpon the talke of the poysoning?
Hora.
I did verie well note him.
Enter Rosincrance and Guildensterne.
Ham.
Oh, ha?
Come some Musick.
Come y Recorders:


For if the King like not the Comedie,


Why then belike he likes it not perdie.
Come some Musicke


   Guild.
Good my Lord, vouchsafe me a word with you
   Ham.
Sir, a whole History
   Guild.
The King, sir
   Ham.
I sir, what of him?
Guild.
Is in his retyrement, maruellous distemper'd


   Ham.
With drinke Sir?
Guild.
No my Lord, rather with choller


   Ham.
Your wisedome should shew it selfe more richer,
to signifie this to his Doctor: for for me to put him
to his Purgation, would perhaps plundge him into farre
more Choller
   Guild.
Good my Lord put your discourse into some
frame, and start not so wildely from my affayre
   Ham.
I am tame Sir, pronounce
   Guild.
The Queene your Mother, in most great affliction
of spirit, hath sent me to you
   Ham.
You are welcome
   Guild.
Nay, good my Lord, this courtesie is not of
the right breed.
If it shall please you to make me a wholsome
answer, I will doe your Mothers command'ment:
if not, your pardon, and my returne shall bee the end of
my Businesse
   Ham.
Sir, I cannot
   Guild.
What, my Lord?
Ham.
Make you a wholsome answere: my wits diseas'd.
But sir, such answers as I can make, you shal command:
or rather you say, my Mother: therfore no more
but to the matter.
My Mother you say
   Rosin.
Then thus she sayes: your behauior hath stroke


her into amazement, and admiration


   Ham.
Oh wonderfull Sonne, that can so astonish a


Mother.
But is there no sequell at the heeles of this Mothers


admiration?
Rosin.
She desires to speake with you in her Closset,


ere you go to bed


   Ham.
We shall obey, were she ten times our Mother.
Haue you any further Trade with vs?
Rosin.
My Lord, you once did loue me


   Ham.
So I do still, by these pickers and stealers
   Rosin.
Good my Lord, what is your cause of distemper?
You do freely barre the doore of your owne Libertie,
if you deny your greefes to your Friend
   Ham.
Sir I lacke Aduancement
   Rosin.
How can that be, when you haue the voyce of


the King himselfe, for your Succession in Denmarke?
Ham.
I, but while the grasse growes, the Prouerbe is


something musty.
Enter one with a Recorder.
O the Recorder.
Let me see, to withdraw with you, why
do you go about to recouer the winde of mee, as if you
would driue me into a toyle?
Guild.
O my Lord, if my Dutie be too bold, my loue
is too vnmannerly
   Ham.
I do not well vnderstand that.
Will you play


vpon this Pipe?
Guild.
My Lord, I cannot


   Ham.
I pray you
   Guild.
Beleeue me, I cannot
   Ham.
I do beseech you
   Guild.
I know no touch of it, my Lord
   Ham.
'Tis as easie as lying: gouerne these Ventiges
with your finger and thumbe, giue it breath with your
mouth, and it will discourse most excellent Musicke.
Looke you, these are the stoppes
   Guild.
But these cannot I command to any vtterance
of hermony, I haue not the skill
   Ham.
Why looke you now, how vnworthy a thing
you make of me: you would play vpon mee; you would
seeme to know my stops: you would pluck out the heart
of my Mysterie; you would sound mee from my lowest
Note, to the top of my Compasse: and there is much Musicke,
excellent Voice, in this little Organe, yet cannot
you make it.
Why do you thinke, that I am easier to bee
plaid on, then a Pipe?
Call me what Instrument you will,
though you can fret me, you cannot play vpon me.
God
blesse you Sir.
Enter Polonius.
Polon.
My Lord; the Queene would speak with you,


and presently


   Ham.
Do you see that Clowd?
that's almost in shape


like a Camell


   Polon.
By'th' Masse, and it's like a Camell indeed
   Ham.
Me thinkes it is like a Weazell
   Polon.
It is back'd like a Weazell
   Ham.
Or like a Whale?
Polon.
Verie like a Whale


   Ham.
Then will I come to my Mother, by and by:


They foole me to the top of my bent.
I will come by and by


   Polon.
I will say so.
Enter.
Ham.
By and by, is easily said.
Leaue me Friends:


'Tis now the verie witching time of night,


When Churchyards yawne, and Hell it selfe breaths out


Contagion to this world.
Now could I drink hot blood,


And do such bitter businesse as the day


Would quake to looke on.
Soft now, to my Mother:


Oh Heart, loose not thy Nature; let not euer


The Soule of Nero, enter this firme bosome:


Let me be cruell, not vnnaturall,


I will speake Daggers to her, but vse none:


My Tongue and Soule in this be Hypocrites.
How in my words someuer she be shent,


To giue them Seales, neuer my Soule consent.
Enter King, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne.
King.
I like him not, nor stands it safe with vs,


To let his madnesse range.
Therefore prepare you,


I your Commission will forthwith dispatch,


And he to England shall along with you:


The termes of our estate, may not endure


Hazard so dangerous as doth hourely grow


Out of his Lunacies


   Guild.
We will our selues prouide:


Most holie and Religious feare it is


To keepe those many many bodies safe


That liue and feede vpon your Maiestie


   Rosin.
The single


And peculiar life is bound


With all the strength and Armour of the minde,


To keepe it selfe from noyance: but much more,


That Spirit, vpon whose spirit depends and rests


The liues of many, the cease of Maiestie


Dies not alone; but like a Gulfe doth draw


What's neere it, with it.
It is a massie wheele


Fixt on the Somnet of the highest Mount.
To whose huge Spoakes, ten thousand lesser things


Are mortiz'd and adioyn'd: which when it falles,


Each small annexment, pettie consequence


Attends the boystrous Ruine.
Neuer alone


Did the King sighe, but with a generall grone


   King.
Arme you, I pray you to this speedie Voyage;


For we will Fetters put vpon this feare,


Which now goes too free-footed


   Both.
We will haste vs.
Exeunt.
Gent.
Enter Polonius.
Pol.
My Lord, he's going to his Mothers Closset:


Behinde the Arras Ile conuey my selfe


To heare the Processe.
Ile warrant shee'l tax him home,


And as you said, and wisely was it said,


'Tis meete that some more audience then a Mother,


Since Nature makes them partiall, should o're-heare


The speech of vantage.
Fare you well my Liege,


Ile call vpon you ere you go to bed,


And tell you what I know


   King.
Thankes deere my Lord.
Oh my offence is ranke, it smels to heauen,


It hath the primall eldest curse vpon't,


A Brothers murther.
Pray can I not,


Though inclination be as sharpe as will:


My stronger guilt, defeats my strong intent,


And like a man to double businesse bound,


I stand in pause where I shall first begin,


And both neglect; what if this cursed hand


Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood,


Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens


To wash it white as Snow?
Whereto serues mercy,


But to confront the visage of Offence?
And what's in Prayer, but this two-fold force,


To be fore-stalled ere we come to fall,


Or pardon'd being downe?
Then Ile looke vp,


My fault is past.
But oh, what forme of Prayer


Can serue my turne?
Forgiue me my foule Murther:


That cannot be, since I am still possest


Of those effects for which I did the Murther.
My Crowne, mine owne Ambition, and my Queene:


May one be pardon'd, and retaine th' offence?
In the corrupted currants of this world,


Offences gilded hand may shoue by Iustice,


And oft 'tis seene, the wicked prize it selfe


Buyes out the Law; but 'tis not so aboue,


There is no shuffling, there the Action lyes


In his true Nature, and we our selues compell'd


Euen to the teeth and forehead of our faults,


To giue in euidence.
What then?
What rests?
Try what Repentance can.
What can it not?
Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?
Oh wretched state!
Oh bosome, blacke as death!
Oh limed soule, that strugling to be free,


Art more ingag'd: Helpe Angels, make assay:


Bow stubborne knees, and heart with strings of Steele,


Be soft as sinewes of the new-borne Babe,


All may be well.
Enter Hamlet.
Ham.
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying,


And now Ile doo't, and so he goes to Heauen,


And so am I reueng'd: that would be scann'd,


A Villaine killes my Father, and for that


I his foule Sonne, do this same Villaine send


To heauen.
Oh this is hyre and Sallery, not Reuenge.
He tooke my Father grossely, full of bread,


With all his Crimes broad blowne, as fresh as May,


And how his Audit stands, who knowes, saue Heauen:


But in our circumstance and course of thought


'Tis heauie with him: and am I then reueng'd,


To take him in the purging of his Soule,


When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
No.
Vp Sword, and know thou a more horrid hent


When he is drunke asleepe: or in his Rage,


Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed,


At gaming, swearing, or about some acte


That ha's no rellish of Saluation in't,


Then trip him, that his heeles may kicke at Heauen,


And that his Soule may be as damn'd and blacke


As Hell, whereto it goes.
My Mother stayes,


This Physicke but prolongs thy sickly dayes.
Enter.
King.
My words flye vp, my thoughts remain below,


Words without thoughts, neuer to Heauen go.
Enter.
Enter Queene and Polonius.
Pol.
He will come straight:


Looke you lay home to him,


Tell him his prankes haue been too broad to beare with,


And that your Grace hath screen'd, and stoode betweene


Much heate, and him.
Ile silence me e'ene heere:


Pray you be round with him


   Ham.
within.
Mother, mother, mother
   Qu.
Ile warrant you, feare me not.
Withdraw, I heare him coming.
Enter Hamlet.
Ham.
Now Mother, what's the matter?
Qu.
Hamlet, thou hast thy Father much offended


   Ham.
Mother, you haue my Father much offended
   Qu.
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue
   Ham.
Go, go, you question with an idle tongue
   Qu.
Why how now Hamlet?
Ham.
Whats the matter now?
Qu.
Haue you forgot me?
Ham.
No by the Rood, not so:


You are the Queene, your Husbands Brothers wife,


But would you were not so.
You are my Mother


   Qu.
Nay, then Ile set those to you that can speake
   Ham.
Come, come, and sit you downe, you shall not


boudge:


You go not till I set you vp a glasse,


Where you may see the inmost part of you?
Qu.
What wilt thou do?
thou wilt not murther me?
Helpe, helpe, hoa


   Pol.
What hoa, helpe, helpe, helpe
   Ham.
How now, a Rat?
dead for a Ducate, dead
   Pol.
Oh I am slaine.
Killes Polonius
   Qu.
Oh me, what hast thou done?
Ham.
Nay I know not, is it the King?
Qu.
Oh what a rash, and bloody deed is this?
Ham.
A bloody deed, almost as bad good Mother,


As kill a King, and marrie with his Brother


   Qu.
As kill a King?
Ham.
I Lady, 'twas my word.
Thou wretched, rash, intruding foole farewell,


I tooke thee for thy Betters, take thy Fortune,


Thou find'st to be too busie, is some danger.
Leaue wringing of your hands, peace, sit you downe,


And let me wring your heart, for so I shall


If it be made of penetrable stuffe;


If damned Custome haue not braz'd it so,


That it is proofe and bulwarke against Sense


   Qu.
What haue I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tong,


In noise so rude against me?
Ham.
Such an Act


That blurres the grace and blush of Modestie,


Cals Vertue Hypocrite, takes off the Rose


From the faire forehead of an innocent loue,


And makes a blister there.
Makes marriage vowes


As false as Dicers Oathes.
Oh such a deed,


As from the body of Contraction pluckes


The very soule, and sweete Religion makes


A rapsidie of words.
Heauens face doth glow,


Yea this solidity and compound masse,


With tristfull visage as against the doome,


Is thought-sicke at the act


   Qu.
Aye me; what act, that roares so lowd, & thunders


in the Index


   Ham.
Looke heere vpon this Picture, and on this,


The counterfet presentment of two Brothers:


See what a grace was seated on his Brow,


Hyperions curles, the front of Ioue himselfe,


An eye like Mars, to threaten or command


A Station, like the Herald Mercurie


New lighted on a heauen-kissing hill:


A Combination, and a forme indeed,


Where euery God did seeme to set his Seale,


To giue the world assurance of a man.
This was your Husband.
Looke you now what followes.
Heere is your Husband, like a Mildew'd eare


Blasting his wholsom breath.
Haue you eyes?
Could you on this faire Mountaine leaue to feed,


And batten on this Moore?
Ha?
Haue you eyes?
You cannot call it Loue: For at your age,


The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,


And waites vpon the Iudgement: and what Iudgement


Would step from this, to this?
What diuell was't,


That thus hath cousend you at hoodman-blinde?
O Shame!
where is thy Blush?
Rebellious Hell,


If thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones,


To flaming youth, let Vertue be as waxe.
And melt in her owne fire.
Proclaime no shame,


When the compulsiue Ardure giues the charge,


Since Frost it selfe, as actiuely doth burne,


As Reason panders Will


   Qu.
O Hamlet, speake no more.
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soule,


And there I see such blacke and grained spots,


As will not leaue their Tinct


   Ham.
Nay, but to liue


In the ranke sweat of an enseamed bed,


Stew'd in Corruption; honying and making loue


Ouer the nasty Stye


   Qu.
Oh speake to me, no more,


These words like Daggers enter in mine eares.
No more sweet Hamlet


   Ham.
A Murderer, and a Villaine:


A Slaue, that is not twentieth part the tythe


Of your precedent Lord.
A vice of Kings,


A Cutpurse of the Empire and the Rule.
That from a shelfe, the precious Diadem stole,


And put it in his Pocket


   Qu.
No more.
Enter Ghost.
Ham.
A King of shreds and patches.
Saue me; and houer o're me with your wings


You heauenly Guards.
What would your gracious figure?
Qu.
Alas he's mad


   Ham.
Do you not come your tardy Sonne to chide,


That laps't in Time and Passion, lets go by


Th' important acting of your dread command?
Oh say


   Ghost.
Do not forget: this Visitation


Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But looke, Amazement on thy Mother sits;


O step betweene her, and her fighting Soule,


Conceit in weakest bodies, strongest workes.
Speake to her Hamlet


   Ham.
How is it with you Lady?
Qu.
Alas, how is't with you?
That you bend your eye on vacancie,


And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse.
Forth at your eyes, your spirits wildely peepe,


And as the sleeping Soldiours in th' Alarme,


Your bedded haire, like life in excrements,


Start vp, and stand an end.
Oh gentle Sonne,


Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemper


Sprinkle coole patience.
Whereon do you looke?
Ham.
On him, on him: look you how pale he glares,


His forme and cause conioyn'd, preaching to stones,


Would make them capeable.
Do not looke vpon me,


Least with this pitteous action you conuert


My sterne effects: then what I haue to do,


Will want true colour; teares perchance for blood


   Qu.
To who do you speake this?
Ham.
Do you see nothing there?
Qu.
Nothing at all, yet all that is I see


   Ham.
Nor did you nothing heare?
Qu.
No, nothing but our selues


   Ham.
Why look you there: looke how it steals away:


My Father in his habite, as he liued,


Looke where he goes euen now out at the Portall.
Enter.
Qu.
This is the very coynage of your Braine,


This bodilesse Creation extasie is very cunning in


   Ham.
Extasie?
My Pulse as yours doth temperately keepe time,


And makes as healthfull Musicke.
It is not madnesse


That I haue vttered; bring me to the Test


And I the matter will re-word: which madnesse


Would gamboll from.
Mother, for loue of Grace,


Lay not a flattering Vnction to your soule,


That not your trespasse, but my madnesse speakes:


It will but skin and filme the Vlcerous place,


Whil'st ranke Corruption mining all within,


Infects vnseene.
Confesse your selfe to Heauen,


Repent what's past, auoyd what is to come,


And do not spred the Compost on the Weedes,


To make them ranke.
Forgiue me this my Vertue,


For in the fatnesse of this pursie times,


Vertue it selfe, of Vice must pardon begge,


Yea courb, and woe, for leaue to do him good


   Qu.
Oh Hamlet,


Thou hast cleft my heart in twaine


   Ham.
O throw away the worser part of it,


And liue the purer with the other halfe.
Good night, but go not to mine Vnkles bed,


Assume a Vertue, if you haue it not, refraine to night,


And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse


To the next abstinence.
Once more goodnight,


And when you are desirous to be blest,


Ile blessing begge of you.
For this same Lord,


I do repent: but heauen hath pleas'd it so,


To punish me with this, and this with me,


That I must be their Scourge and Minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well


The death I gaue him: so againe, good night.
I must be cruell, onely to be kinde;


Thus bad begins and worse remaines behinde


   Qu.
What shall I do?
Ham.
Not this by no meanes that I bid you do:


Let the blunt King tempt you againe to bed,


Pinch Wanton on your cheeke, call you his Mouse,


And let him for a paire of reechie kisses,


Or padling in your necke with his damn'd Fingers,


Make you to rauell all this matter out,


That I essentially am not in madnesse,


But made in craft.
'Twere good you let him know,


For who that's but a Queene, faire, sober, wise,


Would from a Paddocke, from a Bat, a Gibbe,


Such deere concernings hide, Who would do so,


No in despight of Sense and Secrecie,


Vnpegge the Basket on the houses top:


Let the Birds flye, and like the famous Ape


To try Conclusions in the Basket, creepe


And breake your owne necke downe


   Qu.
Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,


And breath of life: I haue no life to breath


What thou hast saide to me


   Ham.
I must to England, you know that?
Qu.
Alacke I had forgot: 'Tis so concluded on


   Ham.
This man shall set me packing:


Ile lugge the Guts into the Neighbor roome,


Mother goodnight.
Indeede this Counsellor


Is now most still, most secret, and most graue,


Who was in life, a foolish prating Knaue.
Come sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Good night Mother.
Exit Hamlet tugging in Polonius.
Enter King.
King.
There's matters in these sighes.
These profound heaues


You must translate; Tis fit we vnderstand them.
Where is your Sonne?
Qu.
Ah my good Lord, what haue I seene to night?
King.
What Gertrude?
How do's Hamlet?
Qu.
Mad as the Seas, and winde, when both contend


Which is the Mightier, in his lawlesse fit


Behinde the Arras, hearing something stirre,


He whips his Rapier out, and cries a Rat, a Rat,


And in his brainish apprehension killes


The vnseene good old man


   King.
Oh heauy deed:


It had bin so with vs had we beene there:


His Liberty is full of threats to all,


To you your selfe, to vs, to euery one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deede be answered?
It will be laide to vs, whose prouidence


Should haue kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt,


This mad yong man.
But so much was our loue,


We would not vnderstand what was most fit,


But like the Owner of a foule disease,


To keepe it from divulging, let's it feede


Euen on the pith of life.
Where is he gone?
Qu.
To draw apart the body he hath kild,


O're whom his very madnesse like some Oare


Among a Minerall of Mettels base


Shewes it selfe pure.
He weepes for what is done


   King.
Oh Gertrude, come away:


The Sun no sooner shall the Mountaines touch,


But we will ship him hence, and this vilde deed,


We must with all our Maiesty and Skill


Both countenance, and excuse.
Enter Ros.
& Guild.
Ho Guildenstern:


Friends both go ioyne you with some further ayde:


Hamlet in madnesse hath Polonius slaine,


And from his Mother Clossets hath he drag'd him.
Go seeke him out, speake faire, and bring the body


Into the Chappell.
I pray you hast in this.
Exit Gent.
Come Gertrude, wee'l call vp our wisest friends,


To let them know both what we meane to do,


And what's vntimely done.
Oh come away,


My soule is full of discord and dismay.
Exeunt.
Enter Hamlet.
Ham.
Safely stowed
   Gentlemen within.
Hamlet, Lord Hamlet
   Ham.
What noise?
Who cals on Hamlet?
Oh heere they come.
Enter Ros.
and Guildensterne.
Ro.
What haue you done my Lord with the dead body?
Ham.
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis Kinne


   Rosin.
Tell vs where 'tis, that we may take it thence,


And beare it to the Chappell


   Ham.
Do not beleeue it
   Rosin.
Beleeue what?
Ham.
That I can keepe your counsell, and not mine


owne.
Besides, to be demanded of a Spundge, what replication


should be made by the Sonne of a King


   Rosin.
Take you me for a Spundge, my Lord?
Ham.
I sir, that sokes vp the Kings Countenance, his
Rewards, his Authorities (but such Officers do the King
best seruice in the end.
He keepes them like an Ape in
the corner of his iaw, first mouth'd to be last swallowed,
when he needes what you haue glean'd, it is but squeezing
you, and Spundge you shall be dry againe
   Rosin.
I vnderstand you not my Lord
   Ham.
I am glad of it: a knauish speech sleepes in a


foolish eare


   Rosin.
My Lord, you must tell vs where the body is,


and go with vs to the King


   Ham.
The body is with the King, but the King is not


with the body.
The King, is a thing-


  Guild.
A thing my Lord?
Ham.
Of nothing: bring me to him, hide Fox, and all


after.
Exeunt.
Enter King.
King.
I haue sent to seeke him, and to find the bodie:


How dangerous is it that this man goes loose:


Yet must not we put the strong Law on him:


Hee's loued of the distracted multitude,


Who like not in their iudgement, but their eyes:


And where 'tis so, th' Offenders scourge is weigh'd


But neerer the offence: to beare all smooth, and euen,


This sodaine sending him away, must seeme


Deliberate pause, diseases desperate growne,


By desperate appliance are releeued,


Or not at all.
Enter Rosincrane.
How now?
What hath befalne?
Rosin.
Where the dead body is bestow'd my Lord,


We cannot get from him


   King.
But where is he?
Rosin.
Without my Lord, guarded to know your


pleasure


   King.
Bring him before vs
   Rosin.
Hoa, Guildensterne?
Bring in my Lord.
Enter Hamlet and Guildensterne.
King.
Now Hamlet, where's Polonius?
Ham.
At Supper


   King.
At Supper?
Where?
Ham.
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten, a certaine
conuocation of wormes are e'ne at him.
Your worm
is your onely Emperor for diet.
We fat all creatures else
to fat vs, and we fat our selfe for Magots.
Your fat King,
and your leane Begger is but variable seruice to dishes,
but to one Table that's the end
   King.
What dost thou meane by this?
Ham.
Nothing but to shew you how a King may go


a Progresse through the guts of a Begger


   King.
Where is Polonius
   Ham.
In heauen, send thither to see.
If your Messenger
finde him not there, seeke him i'th other place your
selfe: but indeed, if you finde him not this moneth, you
shall nose him as you go vp the staires into the Lobby
   King.
Go seeke him there
   Ham.
He will stay till ye come
   K. Hamlet, this deed of thine, for thine especial safety


Which we do tender, as we deerely greeue


For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence


With fierie Quicknesse.
Therefore prepare thy selfe,


The Barke is readie, and the winde at helpe,


Th' Associates tend, and euery thing at bent


For England


   Ham.
For England?
King.
I Hamlet


   Ham.
Good
   King.
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes
   Ham.
I see a Cherube that see's him: but come, for


England.
Farewell deere Mother


   King.
Thy louing Father Hamlet
   Hamlet.
My Mother: Father and Mother is man and
wife: man & wife is one flesh, and so my mother.
Come,
for England.
Exit
  King.
Follow him at foote,


Tempt him with speed aboord:


Delay it not, Ile haue him hence to night.
Away, for euery thing is Seal'd and done


That else leanes on th' Affaire, pray you make hast.
And England, if my loue thou holdst at ought,


As my great power thereof may giue thee sense,


Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red


After the Danish Sword, and thy free awe


Payes homage to vs; thou maist not coldly set


Our Soueraigne Processe, which imports at full


By Letters coniuring to that effect


The present death of Hamlet.
Do it England,


For like the Hecticke in my blood he rages,


And thou must cure me: Till I know 'tis done,


How ere my happes, my ioyes were ne're begun.
Exit
Enter Fortinbras with an Armie.
For.
Go Captaine, from me greet the Danish King,


Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras


Claimes the conueyance of a promis'd March


Ouer his Kingdome.
You know the Rendeuous:


If that his Maiesty would ought with vs,


We shall expresse our dutie in his eye,


And let him know so


   Cap.
I will doo't, my Lord
   For.
Go safely on.
Enter.
Enter Queene and Horatio.
Qu.
I will not speake with her
   Hor.
She is importunate, indeed distract, her moode


will needs be pittied


   Qu.
What would she haue?
Hor.
She speakes much of her Father; saies she heares


There's trickes i'th' world, and hems, and beats her heart,


Spurnes enuiously at Strawes, speakes things in doubt,


That carry but halfe sense: Her speech is nothing,


Yet the vnshaped vse of it doth moue


The hearers to Collection; they ayme at it,


And botch the words vp fit to their owne thoughts,


Which as her winkes, and nods, and gestures yeeld them,


Indeed would make one thinke there would be thought,


Though nothing sure, yet much vnhappily


   Qu.
'Twere good she were spoken with,


For she may strew dangerous coniectures


In ill breeding minds.
Let her come in.
To my sicke soule (as sinnes true Nature is)


Each toy seemes Prologue, to some great amisse,


So full of Artlesse iealousie is guilt,


It spill's it selfe, in fearing to be spilt.
Enter Ophelia distracted.
Ophe.
Where is the beauteous Maiesty of Denmark
   Qu.
How now Ophelia?
Ophe.
How should I your true loue know from another one?
By his Cockle hat and staffe, and his Sandal shoone


   Qu.
Alas sweet Lady: what imports this Song?
Ophe.
Say you?
Nay pray you marke.
He is dead and gone Lady, he is dead and gone,


At his head a grasse-greene Turfe, at his heeles a stone.
Enter King.
Qu.
Nay but Ophelia
   Ophe.
Pray you marke.
White his Shrow'd as the Mountaine Snow


   Qu.
Alas, looke heere my Lord
   Ophe.
Larded with sweet Flowers:


Which bewept to the graue did not go,


With true-loue showres


   King.
How do ye, pretty Lady?
Ophe.
Well, God dil'd you.
They say the Owle was


a Bakers daughter.
Lord, wee know what we are, but


know not what we may be.
God be at your Table


   King.
Conceit vpon her Father
   Ophe.
Pray you let's haue no words of this: but when


they aske you what it meanes, say you this:


To morrow is S[aint].
Valentines day, all in the morning betime,


And I a Maid at your Window, to be your Valentine.
Then vp he rose, & don'd his clothes, & dupt the chamber dore,


Let in the Maid, that out a Maid, neuer departed more


   King.
Pretty Ophelia
   Ophe.
Indeed la?
without an oath Ile make an end ont.
By gis, and by S[aint].
Charity,


Alacke, and fie for shame:


Yong men wil doo't, if they come too't,


By Cocke they are too blame.
Quoth she before you tumbled me,


You promis'd me to Wed:


So would I ha done by yonder Sunne,


And thou hadst not come to my bed


   King.
How long hath she bin thus?
Ophe.
I hope all will be well.
We must bee patient,
but I cannot choose but weepe, to thinke they should
lay him i'th' cold ground: My brother shall knowe of it,
and so I thanke you for your good counsell.
Come, my
Coach: Goodnight Ladies: Goodnight sweet Ladies:
Goodnight, goodnight.
Enter.
King.
Follow her close,


Giue her good watch I pray you:


Oh this is the poyson of deepe greefe, it springs


All from her Fathers death.
Oh Gertrude, Gertrude,


When sorrowes comes, they come not single spies,


But in Battalians.
First, her Father slaine,


Next your Sonne gone, and he most violent Author


Of his owne iust remoue: the people muddied,


Thicke and vnwholsome in their thoughts, and whispers


For good Polonius death; and we haue done but greenly


In hugger mugger to interre him.
Poore Ophelia


Diuided from her selfe, and her faire Iudgement,


Without the which we are Pictures, or meere Beasts.
Last, and as much containing as all these,


Her Brother is in secret come from France,


Keepes on his wonder, keepes himselfe in clouds,


And wants not Buzzers to infect his eare


With pestilent Speeches of his Fathers death,


Where in necessitie of matter Beggard,


Will nothing sticke our persons to Arraigne


In eare and eare.
O my deere Gertrude, this,


Like to a murdering Peece in many places,


Giues me superfluous death.
A Noise within.
Enter a Messenger.
Qu.
Alacke, what noyse is this?
King.
Where are my Switzers?
Let them guard the doore.
What is the matter?
Mes.
Saue your selfe, my Lord.
The Ocean (ouer-peering of his List)


Eates not the Flats with more impittious haste


Then young Laertes, in a Riotous head,


Ore-beares your Officers, the rabble call him Lord,


And as the world were now but to begin,


Antiquity forgot, Custome not knowne,


The Ratifiers and props of euery word,


They cry choose we?
Laertes shall be King,


Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds,


Laertes shall be King, Laertes King


   Qu.
How cheerefully on the false Traile they cry,


Oh this is Counter you false Danish Dogges.
Noise within.
Enter Laertes.
King.
The doores are broke
   Laer.
Where is the King, sirs?
Stand you all without
   All.
No, let's come in
   Laer.
I pray you giue me leaue
   Al.
We will, we will
   Laer.
I thanke you: Keepe the doore.
Oh thou vilde King, giue me my Father


   Qu.
Calmely good Laertes
   Laer.
That drop of blood, that calmes


Proclaimes me Bastard:


Cries Cuckold to my Father, brands the Harlot


Euen heere betweene the chaste vnsmirched brow


Of my true Mother


   King.
What is the cause Laertes,


That thy Rebellion lookes so Gyant-like?
Let him go Gertrude: Do not feare our person:


There's such Diuinity doth hedge a King,


That Treason can but peepe to what it would,


Acts little of his will.
Tell me Laertes,


Why thou art thus Incenst?
Let him go Gertrude.
Speake man


   Laer.
Where's my Father?
King.
Dead


   Qu.
But not by him
   King.
Let him demand his fill
   Laer.
How came he dead?
Ile not be Iuggel'd with.
To hell Allegeance: Vowes, to the blackest diuell.
Conscience and Grace, to the profoundest Pit.
I dare Damnation: to this point I stand,


That both the worlds I giue to negligence,


Let come what comes: onely Ile be reueng'd


Most throughly for my Father


   King.
Who shall stay you?
Laer.
My Will, not all the world,


And for my meanes, Ile husband them so well,


They shall go farre with little


   King.
Good Laertes:


If you desire to know the certaintie


Of your deere Fathers death, if writ in your reuenge,


That Soop-stake you will draw both Friend and Foe,


Winner and Looser


   Laer.
None but his Enemies
   King.
Will you know them then
   La.
To his good Friends, thus wide Ile ope my Armes:


And like the kinde Life-rend'ring Politician,


Repast them with my blood


   King.
Why now you speake


Like a good Childe, and a true Gentleman.
That I am guiltlesse of your Fathers death,


And am most sensible in greefe for it,


It shall as leuell to your Iudgement pierce


As day do's to your eye.
A noise within.
Let her come in.
Enter Ophelia.
Laer.
How now?
what noise is that?
Oh heate drie vp my Braines, teares seuen times salt,


Burne out the Sence and Vertue of mine eye.
By Heauen, thy madnesse shall be payed by waight,


Till our Scale turnes the beame.
Oh Rose of May,


Deere Maid, kinde Sister, sweet Ophelia:


Oh Heauens, is't possible, a yong Maids wits,


Should be as mortall as an old mans life?
Nature is fine in Loue, and where 'tis fine,


It sends some precious instance of it selfe


After the thing it loues


   Ophe.
They bore him bare fac'd on the Beer,


Hey non nony, nony, hey nony:


And on his graue raines many a teare,


Fare you well my Doue


   Laer.
Had'st thou thy wits, and did'st perswade Reuenge,


it could not moue thus


   Ophe.
You must sing downe a-downe, and you call
him a-downe-a.
Oh, how the wheele becomes it?
It is
the false Steward that stole his masters daughter
   Laer.
This nothings more then matter
   Ophe.
There's Rosemary, that's for Remembraunce.
Pray loue remember: and there is Paconcies, that's for


Thoughts


   Laer.
A document in madnesse, thoughts & remembrance


fitted


   Ophe.
There's Fennell for you, and Columbines: ther's
Rew for you, and heere's some for me.
Wee may call it
Herbe-Grace a Sundaies: Oh you must weare your Rew
with a difference.
There's a Daysie, I would giue you
some Violets, but they wither'd all when my Father dyed:
They say, he made a good end;
For bonny sweet Robin is all my ioy
   Laer.
Thought, and Affliction, Passion, Hell it selfe:


She turnes to Fauour, and to prettinesse


   Ophe.
And will he not come againe,


And will he not come againe:


No, no, he is dead, go to thy Death-bed,


He neuer wil come againe.
His Beard as white as Snow,


All Flaxen was his Pole:


He is gone, he is gone, and we cast away mone,


Gramercy on his Soule.
And of all Christian Soules, I pray God.
God buy ye.
Exeunt.
Ophelia
  Laer.
Do you see this, you Gods?
King.
Laertes, I must common with your greefe,


Or you deny me right: go but apart,


Make choice of whom your wisest Friends you will,


And they shall heare and iudge 'twixt you and me;


If by direct or by Colaterall hand


They finde vs touch'd, we will our Kingdome giue,


Our Crowne, our Life, and all that we call Ours


To you in satisfaction.
But if not,


Be you content to lend your patience to vs,


And we shall ioyntly labour with your soule


To giue it due content


   Laer.
Let this be so:


His meanes of death, his obscure buriall;


No Trophee, Sword, nor Hatchment o're his bones,


No Noble rite, nor formall ostentation,


Cry to be heard, as 'twere from Heauen to Earth,


That I must call in question


   King.
So you shall:


And where th' offence is, let the great Axe fall.
I pray you go with me.
Exeunt.
Enter Horatio, with an Attendant.
Hora.
What are they that would speake with me?
Ser.
Saylors sir, they say they haue Letters for you


   Hor.
Let them come in,


I do not know from what part of the world


I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
Enter Saylor.
Say.
God blesse you Sir
   Hor.
Let him blesse thee too
   Say.
Hee shall Sir, and't please him.
There's a Letter
for you Sir: It comes from th' Ambassadours that was
bound for England, if your name be Horatio, as I am let
to know it is.
Reads the Letter.
Horatio, When thou shalt haue ouerlook'd this, giue these
Fellowes some meanes to the King: They haue Letters
for him.
Ere we were two dayes old at Sea, a Pyrate of very
Warlicke appointment gaue vs Chace.
Finding our selues too
slow of Saile, we put on a compelled Valour.
In the Grapple, I
boorded them: On the instant they got cleare of our Shippe, so
I alone became their Prisoner.
They haue dealt with mee, like
Theeues of Mercy, but they knew what they did.
I am to doe
a good turne for them.
Let the King haue the Letters I haue
sent, and repaire thou to me with as much hast as thou wouldest
flye death.
I haue words to speake in your eare, will make thee
dumbe, yet are they much too light for the bore of the Matter.
These good Fellowes will bring thee where I am.
Rosincrance
and Guildensterne, hold their course for England.
Of them
I haue much to tell thee, Farewell.
He that thou knowest thine,
Hamlet.
Come, I will giue you way for these your Letters,
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
To him from whom you brought them.
Enter.
Enter King and Laertes.
King.
Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,


And you must put me in your heart for Friend,


Sith you haue heard, and with a knowing eare,


That he which hath your Noble Father slaine,


Pursued my life


   Laer.
It well appeares.
But tell me,


Why you proceeded not against these feates,


So crimefull, and so Capitall in Nature,


As by your Safety, Wisedome, all things else,


You mainly were stirr'd vp?
King.
O for two speciall Reasons,


Which may to you (perhaps) seeme much vnsinnowed,


And yet to me they are strong.
The Queen his Mother,


Liues almost by his lookes: and for my selfe,


My Vertue or my Plague, be it either which,


She's so coniunctiue to my life, and soule;


That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere,


I could not but by her.
The other Motiue,


Why to a publike count I might not go,


Is the great loue the generall gender beare him,


Who dipping all his Faults in their affection,


Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone,


Conuert his Gyues to Graces.
So that my Arrowes


Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde,


Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe,


And not where I had arm'd them


   Laer.
And so haue I a Noble Father lost,


A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes,


Who was (if praises may go backe againe)


Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age


For her perfections.
But my reuenge will come


   King.
Breake not your sleepes for that,


You must not thinke


That we are made of stuffe, so flat, and dull,


That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger,


And thinke it pastime.
You shortly shall heare more,


I lou'd your Father, and we loue our Selfe,


And that I hope will teach you to imagine-


Enter a Messenger.
How now?
What Newes?
Mes.
Letters my Lord from Hamlet, This to your


Maiesty: this to the Queene


   King.
From Hamlet?
Who brought them?
Mes.
Saylors my Lord they say, I saw them not:


They were giuen me by Claudio, he receiu'd them


   King.
Laertes you shall heare them:


Leaue vs.


Exit Messenger
High and Mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your


Kingdome.
To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly


Eyes.
When I shall (first asking your Pardon thereunto) recount


th' Occasions of my sodaine, and more strange returne.
Hamlet.
What should this meane?
Are all the rest come backe?
Or is it some abuse?
Or no such thing?
Laer.
Know you the hand?
Kin.
'Tis Hamlets Character, naked and in a Postscript


here he sayes alone: Can you aduise me?
Laer.
I'm lost in it my Lord; but let him come,


It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart,


That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth;


Thus diddest thou


   Kin.
If it be so Laertes, as how should it be so:


How otherwise will you be rul'd by me?
Laer.
If so you'l not o'rerule me to a peace


   Kin.
To thine owne peace: if he be now return'd,


As checking at his Voyage, and that he meanes


No more to vndertake it; I will worke him


To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice,


Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall;


And for his death no winde of blame shall breath,


But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice,


And call it accident: Some two Monthes hence


Here was a Gentleman of Normandy,


I'ue seene my selfe, and seru'd against the French,


And they ran well on Horsebacke; but this Gallant


Had witchcraft in't; he grew into his Seat,


And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse,


As had he beene encorps't and demy-Natur'd


With the braue Beast, so farre he past my thought,


That I in forgery of shapes and trickes,


Come short of what he did


   Laer.
A Norman was't?
Kin.
A Norman


   Laer.
Vpon my life Lamound
   Kin.
The very same
   Laer.
I know him well, he is the Brooch indeed,


And Iemme of all our Nation


   Kin.
Hee mad confession of you,


And gaue you such a Masterly report,


For Art and exercise in your defence;


And for your Rapier most especiall,


That he cryed out, t'would be a sight indeed,


If one could match you Sir.
This report of his


Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy,


That he could nothing doe but wish and begge,


Your sodaine comming ore to play with him;


Now out of this


   Laer.
Why out of this, my Lord?
Kin.
Laertes was your Father deare to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,


A face without a heart?
Laer.
Why aske you this?
Kin.
Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father,


But that I know Loue is begun by Time:


And that I see in passages of proofe,


Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it:


Hamlet comes backe: what would you vndertake,


To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed,


More then in words?
Laer.
To cut his throat i'th' Church


   Kin.
No place indeed should murder Sancturize;


Reuenge should haue no bounds: but good Laertes


Will you doe this, keepe close within your Chamber,


Hamlet return'd, shall know you are come home:


Wee'l put on those shall praise your excellence,


And set a double varnish on the fame


The Frenchman gaue you, bring you in fine together,


And wager on your heads, he being remisse,


Most generous, and free from all contriuing,


Will not peruse the Foiles?
So that with ease,


Or with a little shuffling, you may choose


A Sword vnbaited, and in a passe of practice,


Requit him for your Father


   Laer.
I will doo't.
And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword:


I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke


So mortall, I but dipt a knife in it,


Where it drawes blood, no Cataplasme so rare,


Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue


Vnder the Moone, can saue the thing from death,


That is but scratcht withall: Ile touch my point,


With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,


It may be death


   Kin.
Let's further thinke of this,


Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes


May fit vs to our shape, if this should faile;


And that our drift looke through our bad performance,


'Twere better not assaid; therefore this Proiect


Should haue a backe or second, that might hold,


If this should blast in proofe: Soft, let me see


Wee'l make a solemne wager on your commings,


I ha't: when in your motion you are hot and dry,


As make your bowts more violent to the end,


And that he cals for drinke; Ile haue prepar'd him


A Challice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,


If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,


Our purpose may hold there; how sweet Queene.
Enter Queene.
Queen.
One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele,


So fast they'l follow: your Sister's drown'd Laertes


   Laer.
Drown'd!
O where?
Queen.
There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke,


That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame:


There with fantasticke Garlands did she come,


Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples,


That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name;


But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them:


There on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weeds


Clambring to hang; an enuious sliuer broke,


When downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe,


Fell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide,


And Mermaid-like, a while they bore her vp,


Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,


As one incapable of her owne distresse,


Or like a creature Natiue, and indued


Vnto that Element: but long it could not be,


Till that her garments, heauy with her drinke,


Pul'd the poore wretch from her melodious buy,


To muddy death


   Laer.
Alas then, is she drown'd?
Queen.
Drown'd, drown'd


   Laer.
Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia,


And therefore I forbid my teares: but yet


It is our tricke, Nature her custome holds,


Let shame say what it will; when these are gone


The woman will be out: Adue my Lord,


I haue a speech of fire, that faine would blaze,


But that this folly doubts it.
Enter.
Kin.
Let's follow, Gertrude:


How much I had to doe to calme his rage?
Now feare I this will giue it start againe;


Therefore let's follow.
Exeunt.
Enter two Clownes.
Clown.
Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall, that
wilfully seekes her owne saluation?
Other.
I tell thee she is, and therefore make her Graue
straight, the Crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian
buriall
   Clo.
How can that be, vnlesse she drowned her selfe in


her owne defence?
Other.
Why 'tis found so


   Clo.
It must be Se offendendo, it cannot bee else: for
heere lies the point; If I drowne my selfe wittingly, it argues
an Act: and an Act hath three branches.
It is an
Act to doe and to performe; argall she drown'd her selfe
wittingly
   Other.
Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer
   Clown.
Giue me leaue; heere lies the water; good:
heere stands the man; good: If the man goe to this water
and drowne himselfe; it is will he nill he, he goes;
marke you that?
But if the water come to him & drowne
him; hee drownes not himselfe.
Argall, hee that is not
guilty of his owne death, shortens not his owne life
   Other.
But is this law?
Clo.
I marry is't, Crowners Quest Law


   Other.
Will you ha the truth on't: if this had not
beene a Gentlewoman, shee should haue beene buried
out of Christian Buriall
   Clo.
Why there thou say'st.
And the more pitty that
great folke should haue countenance in this world to
drowne or hang themselues, more then their euen Christian.
Come, my Spade; there is no ancient Gentlemen,
but Gardiners, Ditchers and Graue-makers; they hold vp
Adams Profession
   Other.
Was he a Gentleman?
Clo.
He was the first that euer bore Armes


   Other.
Why he had none
   Clo.
What, ar't a Heathen?
how doth thou vnderstand
the Scripture?
the Scripture sayes Adam dig'd;
could hee digge without Armes?
Ile put another question
to thee; if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confesse
thy selfe-
  Other.
Go too
   Clo.
What is he that builds stronger then either the


Mason, the Shipwright, or the Carpenter?
Other.
The Gallowes maker; for that Frame outliues a


thousand Tenants


   Clo.
I like thy wit well in good faith, the Gallowes
does well; but how does it well?
it does well to those
that doe ill: now, thou dost ill to say the Gallowes is
built stronger then the Church: Argall, the Gallowes
may doe well to thee.
Too't againe, Come
   Other.
Who builds stronger then a Mason, a Shipwright,


or a Carpenter?
Clo.
I, tell me that, and vnyoake


   Other.
Marry, now I can tell
   Clo.
Too't
   Other.
Masse, I cannot tell.
Enter Hamlet and Horatio a farre off.
Clo.
Cudgell thy braines no more about it; for your
dull Asse will not mend his pace with beating; and when
you are ask't this question next, say a Graue-maker: the
Houses that he makes, lasts till Doomesday: go, get thee
to Yaughan, fetch me a stoupe of Liquor.
Sings.
In youth when I did loue, did loue,


me thought it was very sweete:


To contract O the time for a my behoue,


O me thought there was nothing meete


   Ham.
Ha's this fellow no feeling of his businesse, that


he sings at Graue-making?
Hor.
Custome hath made it in him a property of easinesse


   Ham.
'Tis ee'n so; the hand of little Imployment hath


the daintier sense


   Clowne sings.
But Age with his stealing steps
hath caught me in his clutch:
And hath shipped me intill the Land,
as if I had neuer beene such
   Ham.
That Scull had a tongue in it, and could sing
once: how the knaue iowles it to th' grownd, as if it
were Caines Iaw-bone, that did the first murther: It
might be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o're Offices:
one that could circumuent God, might it not?
Hor.
It might, my Lord
   Ham.
Or of a Courtier, which could say, Good Morrow
sweet Lord: how dost thou, good Lord?
this
might be my Lord such a one, that prais'd my Lord such
a ones Horse, when he meant to begge it; might it not?
Hor.
I, my Lord
   Ham.
Why ee'n so: and now my Lady Wormes,
Chaplesse, and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons
Spade; heere's fine Reuolution, if wee had the tricke to
see't.
Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but
to play at Loggets with 'em?
mine ake to thinke
on't
   Clowne sings.
A Pickhaxe and a Spade, a Spade,
for and a shrowding-Sheete:
O a Pit of Clay for to be made,
for such a Guest is meete
   Ham.
There's another: why might not that bee the
Scull of a Lawyer?
where be his Quiddits now?
his
Quillets?
his Cases?
his Tenures, and his Tricks?
why
doe's he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about
the Sconce with a dirty Shouell, and will not tell him of
his Action of Battery?
hum.
This fellow might be in's
time a great buyer of Land, with his Statutes, his Recognizances,
his Fines, his double Vouchers, his Recoueries:
Is this the fine of his Fines, and the recouery of his Recoueries,
to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt?
will his
Vouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases, and double
ones too, then the length and breadth of a paire of
Indentures?
the very Conueyances of his Lands will
hardly lye in this Boxe; and must the Inheritor himselfe
haue no more?
ha?
Hor.
Not a iot more, my Lord
   Ham.
Is not Parchment made of Sheep-skinnes?
Hor.
I my Lord, and of Calue-skinnes too


   Ham.
They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurance
in that.
I will speake to this fellow: whose Graue's
this Sir?
Clo.
Mine Sir:
O a Pit of Clay for to be made,
for such a Guest is meete
   Ham.
I thinke it be thine indeed: for thou liest in't
   Clo.
You lye out on't Sir, and therefore it is not yours:
for my part, I doe not lye in't; and yet it is mine
   Ham.
Thou dost lye in't, to be in't and say 'tis thine:
'tis for the dead, not for the quicke, therefore thou
lyest
   Clo.
'Tis a quicke lye Sir, 'twill away againe from me


to you


   Ham.
What man dost thou digge it for?
Clo.
For no man Sir


   Ham.
What woman then?
Clo.
For none neither


   Ham.
Who is to be buried in't?
Clo.
One that was a woman Sir; but rest her Soule,


shee's dead


   Ham.
How absolute the knaue is?
wee must speake
by the Carde, or equiuocation will vndoe vs: by the
Lord Horatio, these three yeares I haue taken note of it,
the Age is growne so picked, that the toe of the Pesant
comes so neere the heeles of our Courtier, hee galls his
Kibe.
How long hast thou been a Graue-maker?
Clo.
Of all the dayes i'th' yeare, I came too't that day
that our last King Hamlet o'recame Fortinbras
   Ham.
How long is that since?
Clo.
Cannot you tell that?
euery foole can tell that:


It was the very day, that young Hamlet was borne, hee


that was mad, and sent into England


   Ham.
I marry, why was he sent into England?
Clo.
Why, because he was mad; hee shall recouer his


wits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter there


   Ham.
Why?
Clo.
'Twill not be seene in him, there the men are as


mad as he


   Ham.
How came he mad?
Clo.
Very strangely they say


   Ham.
How strangely?
Clo.
Faith e'ene with loosing his wits


   Ham.
Vpon what ground?
Clo.
Why heere in Denmarke: I haue bin sixeteene


heere, man and Boy thirty yeares


   Ham.
How long will a man lie i'th' earth ere he rot?
Clo.
Ifaith, if he be not rotten before he die (as we haue
many pocky Coarses now adaies, that will scarce hold
the laying in) he will last you some eight yeare, or nine
yeare.
A Tanner will last you nine yeare
   Ham.
Why he, more then another?
Clo.
Why sir, his hide is so tan'd with his Trade, that
he will keepe out water a great while.
And your water,
is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body.
Heres a Scull
now: this Scul, has laine in the earth three & twenty years
   Ham.
Whose was it?
Clo.
A whoreson mad Fellowes it was;


Whose doe you thinke it was?
Ham.
Nay, I know not


   Clo.
A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue, a pour'd a


Flaggon of Renish on my head once.
This same Scull


Sir, this same Scull sir, was Yoricks Scull, the Kings Iester


   Ham.
This?
Clo.
E'ene that


   Ham.
Let me see.
Alas poore Yorick, I knew him Horatio,
a fellow of infinite Iest; of most excellent fancy, he
hath borne me on his backe a thousand times: And how
abhorred my Imagination is, my gorge rises at it.
Heere
hung those lipps, that I haue kist I know not how oft.
Where be your Iibes now?
Your Gambals?
Your
Songs?
Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to
set the Table on a Rore?
No one now to mock your own
Ieering?
Quite chopfalne?
Now get you to my Ladies
Chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thicke, to this
fauour she must come.
Make her laugh at that: prythee
Horatio tell me one thing
   Hor.
What's that my Lord?
Ham.
Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o'this fashion


i'th' earth?
Hor.
E'ene so


   Ham.
And smelt so?
Puh
   Hor.
E'ene so, my Lord
   Ham.
To what base vses we may returne Horatio.
Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander,
till he find it stopping a bunghole
   Hor.
'Twere to consider: to curiously to consider so
   Ham.
No faith, not a iot.
But to follow him thether


with modestie enough, & likeliehood to lead it; as thus.
Alexander died: Alexander was buried: Alexander returneth


into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make


Lome, and why of that Lome (whereto he was conuerted)


might they not stopp a Beere-barrell?
Imperiall Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,


Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away.
Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,


Should patch a Wall, t' expell the winters flaw.
But soft, but soft, aside; heere comes the King.
Enter King, Queene, Laertes, and a Coffin, with Lords attendant.
The Queene, the Courtiers.
Who is that they follow,


And with such maimed rites?
This doth betoken,


The Coarse they follow, did with disperate hand,


Fore do it owne life; 'twas some Estate.
Couch we a while, and mark


   Laer.
What Cerimony else?
Ham.
That is Laertes, a very Noble youth: Marke


   Laer.
What Cerimony else?
Priest.
Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg'd.
As we haue warrantie, her death was doubtfull,


And but that great Command, o're-swaies the order,


She should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg'd,


Till the last Trumpet.
For charitable praier,


Shardes, Flints, and Peebles, should be throwne on her:


Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites,


Her Maiden strewments, and the bringing home


Of Bell and Buriall


   Laer.
Must there no more be done ?
Priest.
No more be done:


We should prophane the seruice of the dead,


To sing sage Requiem, and such rest to her


As to peace-parted Soules


   Laer.
Lay her i'th' earth,


And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh,


May Violets spring.
I tell thee (churlish Priest)


A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be,


When thou liest howling?
Ham.
What, the faire Ophelia?
Queene.
Sweets, to the sweet farewell.
I hop'd thou should'st haue bin my Hamlets wife:


I thought thy Bride-bed to haue deckt (sweet Maid)


And not t'haue strew'd thy Graue


   Laer.
Oh terrible woer,


Fall ten times trebble, on that cursed head


Whose wicked deed, thy most Ingenious sence


Depriu'd thee of.
Hold off the earth a while,


Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes:


Leaps in the graue.
Now pile your dust, vpon the quicke, and dead,


Till of this flat a Mountaine you haue made,


To o're top old Pelion, or the skyish head


Of blew Olympus


   Ham.
What is he, whose griefes


Beares such an Emphasis?
whose phrase of Sorrow


Coniure the wandring Starres, and makes them stand


Like wonder-wounded hearers?
This is I,


Hamlet the Dane


   Laer.
The deuill take thy soule
   Ham.
Thou prai'st not well,


I prythee take thy fingers from my throat;


Sir though I am not Spleenatiue, and rash,


Yet haue I something in me dangerous,


Which let thy wisenesse feare.
Away thy hand


   King.
Pluck them asunder
   Qu.
Hamlet, Hamlet
   Gen. Good my Lord be quiet
   Ham.
Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme.
Vntill my eielids will no longer wag


   Qu.
Oh my Sonne, what Theame?
Ham.
I lou'd Ophelia; fortie thousand Brothers


Could not (with all there quantitie of Loue)


Make vp my summe.
What wilt thou do for her?
King.
Oh he is mad Laertes,


  Qu.
For loue of God forbeare him


   Ham.
Come show me what thou'lt doe.
Woo't weepe?
Woo't fight?
Woo't teare thy selfe?
Woo't drinke vp Esile, eate a Crocodile?
Ile doo't.
Dost thou come heere to whine;


To outface me with leaping in her Graue?
Be buried quicke with her, and so will I.
And if thou prate of Mountaines; let them throw


Millions of Akers on vs; till our ground


Sindging his pate against the burning Zone,


Make Ossa like a wart.
Nay, and thou'lt mouth,


Ile rant as well as thou


   Kin.
This is meere Madnesse:


And thus awhile the fit will worke on him:


Anon as patient as the female Doue,


When that her Golden Cuplet are disclos'd;


His silence will sit drooping


   Ham.
Heare you Sir:


What is the reason that you vse me thus?
I lou'd you euer; but it is no matter:


Let Hercules himselfe doe what he may,


The Cat will Mew, and Dogge will haue his day.
Enter.
Kin.
I pray you good Horatio wait vpon him,


Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech,


Wee'l put the matter to the present push:


Good Gertrude set some watch ouer your Sonne,


This Graue shall haue a liuing Monument:


An houre of quiet shortly shall we see;


Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
Exeunt.
Enter Hamlet and Horatio
   Ham.
So much for this Sir; now let me see the other,


You doe remember all the Circumstance


   Hor.
Remember it my Lord?
Ham.
Sir, in my heart there was a kinde of fighting,


That would not let me sleepe; me thought I lay


Worse then the mutines in the Bilboes, rashly,


(And praise be rashnesse for it) let vs know,


Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well,


When our deare plots do paule, and that should teach vs,


There's a Diuinity that shapes our ends,


Rough-hew them how we will


   Hor.
That is most certaine
   Ham.
Vp from my Cabin


My sea-gowne scarft about me in the darke,


Grop'd I to finde out them; had my desire,


Finger'd their Packet, and in fine, withdrew


To mine owne roome againe, making so bold,


(My feares forgetting manners) to vnseale


Their grand Commission, where I found Horatio,


Oh royall knauery: An exact command,


Larded with many seuerall sorts of reason;


Importing Denmarks health, and Englands too,


With hoo, such Bugges and Goblins in my life,


That on the superuize no leasure bated,


No not to stay the grinding of the Axe,


My head should be struck off


   Hor.
Ist possible?
Ham.
Here's the Commission, read it at more leysure:


But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed?
Hor.
I beseech you


   Ham.
Being thus benetted round with Villaines,


Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines,


They had begun the Play.
I sate me downe,


Deuis'd a new Commission, wrote it faire,


I once did hold it as our Statists doe,


A basenesse to write faire; and laboured much


How to forget that learning: but Sir now,


It did me Yeomans seriuce: wilt thou know


The effects of what I wrote?
Hor.
I, good my Lord


   Ham.
An earnest Coniuration from the King,


As England was his faithfull Tributary,


As loue betweene them, as the Palme should flourish,


As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare,


And stand a Comma 'tweene their amities,


And many such like Assis of great charge,


That on the view and know of these Contents,


Without debatement further, more or lesse,


He should the bearers put to sodaine death,


Not shriuing time allowed


   Hor.
How was this seal'd?
Ham.
Why, euen in that was Heauen ordinate;


I had my fathers Signet in my Purse,


Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale:


Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other,


Subscrib'd it, gau't th' impression, plac't it safely,


The changeling neuer knowne: Now, the next day


Was our Sea Fight, and what to this was sement,


Thou know'st already


   Hor.
So Guildensterne and Rosincrance, go too't
   Ham.
Why man, they did make loue to this imployment


They are not neere my Conscience; their debate


Doth by their owne insinuation grow:


'Tis dangerous, when the baser nature comes


Betweene the passe, and fell incensed points


Of mighty opposites


   Hor.
Why, what a King is this?
Ham.
Does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vpon


He that hath kil'd my King, and whor'd my Mother,


Popt in betweene th' election and my hopes,


Throwne out his Angle for my proper life,


And with such coozenage; is't not perfect conscience,


To quit him with this arme?
And is't not to be damn'd


To let this Canker of our nature come


In further euill


   Hor.
It must be shortly knowne to him from England


What is the issue of the businesse there


   Ham.
It will be short,


The interim's mine, and a mans life's no more


Then to say one: but I am very sorry good Horatio,


That to Laertes I forgot my selfe;


For by the image of my Cause, I see


The Portraiture of his; Ile count his fauours:


But sure the brauery of his griefe did put me


Into a Towring passion


   Hor.
Peace, who comes heere?
Enter young Osricke.
Osr.
Your Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke
   Ham.
I humbly thank you Sir, dost know this waterflie?
Hor.
No my good Lord


   Ham.
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
know him: he hath much Land, and fertile; let a Beast
be Lord of Beasts, and his Crib shall stand at the Kings
Messe; 'tis a Chowgh; but as I saw spacious in the possession
of dirt
   Osr.
Sweet Lord, if your friendship were at leysure,


I should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty


   Ham.
I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit; put


your Bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head


   Osr.
I thanke your Lordship, 'tis very hot
   Ham.
No, beleeue mee 'tis very cold, the winde is


Northerly


   Osr.
It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed
   Ham.
Mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for my


Complexion


   Osr.
Exceedingly, my Lord, it is very soultry, as 'twere


I cannot tell how: but my Lord, his Maiesty bad me signifie


to you, that he ha's laid a great wager on your head:


Sir, this is the matter


   Ham.
I beseech you remember
   Osr.
Nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith:
Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at
his weapon
   Ham.
What's his weapon?
Osr.
Rapier and dagger


   Ham.
That's two of his weapons; but well
   Osr.
The sir King ha's wag'd with him six Barbary horses,
against the which he impon'd as I take it, sixe French
Rapiers and Poniards, with their assignes, as Girdle,
Hangers or so: three of the Carriages infaith are very
deare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most delicate
carriages, and of very liberall conceit
   Ham.
What call you the Carriages?
Osr.
The Carriages Sir, are the hangers


   Ham.
The phrase would bee more Germaine to the
matter: If we could carry Cannon by our sides; I would
it might be Hangers till then; but on sixe Barbary Horses
against sixe French Swords: their Assignes, and three
liberall conceited Carriages, that's the French but against
the Danish; why is this impon'd as you call it?
Osr.
The King Sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene
you and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits;
He hath one twelue for mine, and that would come to
imediate tryall, if your Lordship would vouchsafe the
Answere
   Ham.
How if I answere no?
Osr.
I meane my Lord, the opposition of your person


in tryall


   Ham.
Sir, I will walke heere in the Hall; if it please
his Maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
the Foyles bee brought, the Gentleman willing, and the
King hold his purpose; I will win for him if I can: if
not, Ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits
   Osr.
Shall I redeliuer you ee'n so?
Ham.
To this effect Sir, after what flourish your nature


will


   Osr.
I commend my duty to your Lordship
   Ham.
Yours, yours; hee does well to commend it


himselfe, there are no tongues else for's tongue


   Hor.
This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his


head


   Ham.
He did Complie with his Dugge before hee
suck't it: thus had he and mine more of the same Beauty
that I know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of
the time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of
yesty collection, which carries them through & through
the most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow
them to their tryalls: the Bubbles are out
   Hor.
You will lose this wager, my Lord
   Ham.
I doe not thinke so, since he went into France,
I haue beene in continuall practice; I shall winne at the
oddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about
my heart: but it is no matter
   Hor.
Nay, good my Lord
   Ham.
It is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of


gain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman


   Hor.
If your minde dislike any thing, obey.
I will forestall


their repaire hither, and say you are not fit


   Ham.
Not a whit, we defie Augury; there's a speciall
Prouidence in the fall of a sparrow.
If it be now, 'tis not
to come: if it bee not to come, it will bee now: if it
be not now; yet it will come; the readinesse is all, since no
man ha's ought of what he leaues.
What is't to leaue betimes?
Enter King, Queene, Laertes and Lords, with other Attendants with
Foyles,
and Gauntlets, a Table and Flagons of Wine on it.
Kin.
Come Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me
   Ham.
Giue me your pardon Sir, I'ue done you wrong,


But pardon't as you are a Gentleman.
This presence knowes,


And you must needs haue heard how I am punisht


With sore distraction?
What I haue done


That might your nature honour, and exception


Roughly awake, I heere proclaime was madnesse:


Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes?
Neuer Hamlet.
If Hamlet from himselfe be tane away:


And when he's not himselfe, do's wrong Laertes,


Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it:


Who does it then?
His Madnesse?
If't be so,


Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong'd,


His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy.
Sir, in this Audience,


Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd euill,


Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts,


That I haue shot mine Arrow o're the house,


And hurt my Mother


   Laer.
I am satisfied in Nature,


Whose motiue in this case should stirre me most


To my Reuenge.
But in my termes of Honor


I stand aloofe, and will no reconcilement,


Till by some elder Masters of knowne Honor,


I haue a voyce, and president of peace


To keepe my name vngorg'd.
But till that time,


I do receiue your offer'd loue like loue,


And wil not wrong it


   Ham.
I do embrace it freely,


And will this Brothers wager frankely play.
Giue vs the Foyles: Come on


   Laer.
Come one for me
   Ham.
Ile be your foile Laertes, in mine ignorance,


Your Skill shall like a Starre i'th' darkest night,


Sticke fiery off indeede


   Laer.
You mocke me Sir
   Ham.
No by this hand
   King.
Giue them the Foyles yong Osricke,


Cousen Hamlet, you know the wager


   Ham.
Verie well my Lord,


Your Grace hath laide the oddes a'th' weaker side


   King.
I do not feare it,


I haue seene you both:


But since he is better'd, we haue therefore oddes


   Laer.
This is too heauy,


Let me see another


   Ham.
This likes me well,


These Foyles haue all a length.
Prepare to play.
Osricke.
I my good Lord
   King.
Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table:


If Hamlet giue the first, or second hit,


Or quit in answer of the third exchange,


Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire,


The King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath,


And in the Cup an vnion shal he throw


Richer then that, which foure successiue Kings


In Denmarkes Crowne haue worne.
Giue me the Cups,


And let the Kettle to the Trumpets speake,


The Trumpet to the Cannoneer without,


The Cannons to the Heauens, the Heauen to Earth,


Now the King drinkes to Hamlet.
Come, begin,


And you the Iudges beare a wary eye


   Ham.
Come on sir
   Laer.
Come on sir.
They play.
Ham.
One
   Laer.
No
   Ham.
Iudgement
   Osr.
A hit, a very palpable hit
   Laer.
Well: againe
   King.
Stay, giue me drinke.
Hamlet, this Pearle is thine,


Here's to thy health.
Giue him the cup,


Trumpets sound, and shot goes off.
Ham.
Ile play this bout first, set by a-while.
Come: Another hit; what say you?
Laer.
A touch, a touch, I do confesse


   King.
Our Sonne shall win
   Qu.
He's fat, and scant of breath.
Heere's a Napkin, rub thy browes,


The Queene Carowses to thy fortune, Hamlet


   Ham.
Good Madam
   King.
Gertrude, do not drinke
   Qu.
I will my Lord;


I pray you pardon me


   King.
It is the poyson'd Cup, it is too late
   Ham.
I dare not drinke yet Madam,


By and by


   Qu.
Come, let me wipe thy face
   Laer.
My Lord, Ile hit him now
   King.
I do not thinke't
   Laer.
And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience
   Ham.
Come for the third.
Laertes, you but dally,


I pray you passe with your best violence,


I am affear'd you make a wanton of me


   Laer.
Say you so?
Come on.
Play.
Osr.
Nothing neither way
   Laer.
Haue at you now.
In scuffling they change Rapiers.
King.
Part them, they are incens'd
   Ham.
Nay come, againe
   Osr.
Looke to the Queene there hoa
   Hor.
They bleed on both sides.
How is't my Lord?
Osr.
How is't Laertes?
Laer.
Why as a Woodcocke


To mine Sprindge, Osricke,


I am iustly kill'd with mine owne Treacherie


   Ham.
How does the Queene?
King.
She sounds to see them bleede


   Qu.
No, no, the drinke, the drinke.
Oh my deere Hamlet, the drinke, the drinke,


I am poyson'd


   Ham.
Oh Villany!
How?
Let the doore be lock'd.
Treacherie, seeke it out


   Laer.
It is heere Hamlet.
Hamlet, thou art slaine,


No Medicine in the world can do thee good.
In thee, there is not halfe an houre of life;


The Treacherous Instrument is in thy hand,


Vnbated and envenom'd: the foule practise


Hath turn'd it selfe on me.
Loe, heere I lye,


Neuer to rise againe: Thy Mothers poyson'd:


I can no more, the King, the King's too blame


   Ham.
The point envenom'd too,


Then venome to thy worke.
Hurts the King.
All.
Treason, Treason
   King.
O yet defend me Friends, I am but hurt
   Ham.
Heere thou incestuous, murdrous,


Damned Dane,


Drinke off this Potion: Is thy Vnion heere?
Follow my Mother.
King Dyes.
Laer.
He is iustly seru'd.
It is a poyson temp'red by himselfe:


Exchange forgiuenesse with me, Noble Hamlet;


Mine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee,


Nor thine on me.
Dyes.
Ham.
Heauen make thee free of it, I follow thee.
I am dead Horatio, wretched Queene adiew,


You that looke pale, and tremble at this chance,


That are but Mutes or audience to this acte:


Had I but time (as this fell Sergeant death


Is strick'd in his Arrest) oh I could tell you.
But let it be: Horatio, I am dead,


Thou liu'st, report me and my causes right


To the vnsatisfied


   Hor.
Neuer beleeue it.
I am more an Antike Roman then a Dane:


Heere's yet some Liquor left


   Ham.
As th'art a man, giue me the Cup.
Let go, by Heauen Ile haue't.
Oh good Horatio, what a wounded name,


(Things standing thus vnknowne) shall liue behind me.
If thou did'st euer hold me in thy heart,


Absent thee from felicitie awhile,


And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine,


To tell my Storie.
March afarre off, and shout within.
What warlike noyse is this?
Enter Osricke.
Osr.
Yong Fortinbras, with conquest come fro[m] Poland


To th' Ambassadors of England giues this warlike volly


   Ham.
O I dye Horatio:


The potent poyson quite ore-crowes my spirit,


I cannot liue to heare the Newes from England,


But I do prophesie th' election lights


On Fortinbras, he ha's my dying voyce,


So tell him with the occurrents more and lesse,


Which haue solicited.
The rest is silence.
O, o, o, o.


Dyes
  Hora.
Now cracke a Noble heart:


Goodnight sweet Prince,


And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest,


Why do's the Drumme come hither?
Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador, with Drumme, Colours,


and


Attendants.
Fortin.
Where is this sight?
Hor.
What is it ye would see;


If ought of woe, or wonder, cease your search


   For.
His quarry cries on hauocke.
Oh proud death,


What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell.
That thou so many Princes, at a shoote,


So bloodily hast strooke


   Amb.
The sight is dismall,


And our affaires from England come too late,


The eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing,


To tell him his command'ment is fulfill'd,


That Rosincrance and Guildensterne are dead:


Where should we haue our thankes?
Hor.
Not from his mouth,


Had it th' abilitie of life to thanke you:


He neuer gaue command'ment for their death.
But since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question,


You from the Polake warres, and you from England


Are heere arriued.
Giue order that these bodies


High on a stage be placed to the view,


And let me speake to th' yet vnknowing world,


How these things came about.
So shall you heare


Of carnall, bloudie, and vnnaturall acts,


Of accidentall iudgements, casuall slaughters


Of death's put on by cunning, and forc'd cause,


And in this vpshot, purposes mistooke,


Falne on the Inuentors head.
All this can I


Truly deliuer


   For.

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.
The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.
This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.
If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.
[10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]

Enter Flavius, Marullus, and certain Commoners.
FLAVIUS.
Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.
Is this a holiday?
What, know you not,


    Being mechanical, you ought not walk


    Upon a laboring day without the sign


    Of your profession?
Speak, what trade art thou?
FIRST COMMONER.
Why, sir, a carpenter.
MARULLUS.
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
You, sir, what trade are you?
SECOND COMMONER.
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am


    but, as you would say, a cobbler.
MARULLUS.
But what trade art thou?
Answer me directly.
SECOND COMMONER.
A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe


    conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
MARULLUS.
What trade, thou knave?
Thou naughty knave, what trade?
SECOND COMMONER.
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet,


    if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
MARULLUS.
What mean'st thou by that?
Mend me, thou saucy fellow!
SECOND COMMONER.
Why, sir, cobble you.
FLAVIUS.
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
SECOND COMMONER.
Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I


    meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters, but with awl.
I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are in


    great danger, I recover them.
As proper men as ever trod upon


    neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.
FLAVIUS.
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
SECOND COMMONER.
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself


    into more work.
But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar


    and to rejoice in his triumph.
MARULLUS.
Wherefore rejoice?
What conquest brings he home?
What tributaries follow him to Rome


    To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,


    Knew you not Pompey?
Many a time and oft


    Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,


    To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,


    Your infants in your arms, and there have sat


    The livelong day with patient expectation


    To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.
And when you saw his chariot but appear,


    Have you not made an universal shout


    That Tiber trembled underneath her banks


    To hear the replication of your sounds


    Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire?
And do you now cull out a holiday?
And do you now strew flowers in his way


    That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?
Be gone!
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,


    Pray to the gods to intermit the plague


    That needs must light on this ingratitude.
FLAVIUS.
Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,


    Assemble all the poor men of your sort,


    Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears


    Into the channel, till the lowest stream


    Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
Exeunt all Commoners.
See whether their basest metal be not moved;


    They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;


    This way will I. Disrobe the images


    If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.
MARULLUS.
May we do so?
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
FLAVIUS.
It is no matter; let no images


    Be hung with Caesar's trophies.
I'll about


    And drive away the vulgar from the streets;


    So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing


    Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,


    Who else would soar above the view of men


    And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
Exeunt.
Flourish.
Enter Caesar; Antony, for the course; Calpurnia, Portia,
Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, and Casca; a great crowd follows,
among them a Soothsayer.
CAESAR.
Calpurnia!
CASCA.
Peace, ho!
Caesar speaks.
Music ceases.
CAESAR.
Calpurnia!
CALPURNIA.
Here, my lord.
CAESAR.
Stand you directly in Antonio's way,


    When he doth run his course.
Antonio!
ANTONY.
Caesar, my lord?
CAESAR.
Forget not in your speed, Antonio,


    To touch Calpurnia, for our elders say


    The barren, touched in this holy chase,


    Shake off their sterile curse.
ANTONY.
I shall remember.
When Caesar says "Do this," it is perform'd.
CAESAR.
Set on, and leave no ceremony out.
Flourish.
SOOTHSAYER.
Caesar!
CAESAR.
Ha!
Who calls?
CASCA.
Bid every noise be still.
Peace yet again!
CAESAR.
Who is it in the press that calls on me?
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,


    Cry "Caesar."
Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear.
SOOTHSAYER.
Beware the ides of March.
CAESAR.
What man is that?
BRUTUS.
A soothsayer you beware the ides of March.
CAESAR.
Set him before me let me see his face.
CASSIUS.
Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
CAESAR.
What say'st thou to me now?
Speak once again.
SOOTHSAYER.
Beware the ides of March.
CAESAR.
He is a dreamer; let us leave him.
Pass.
Sennet.
Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius.
CASSIUS.
Will you go see the order of the course?
BRUTUS.
Not I.


  CASSIUS.
I pray you, do.
BRUTUS.
I am not gamesome; I do lack some part


    Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;


    I'll leave you.
CASSIUS.
Brutus, I do observe you now of late;


    I have not from your eyes that gentleness


    And show of love as I was wont to have;


    You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand


    Over your friend that loves you.
BRUTUS.
Cassius,


    Be not deceived; if I have veil'd my look,


    I turn the trouble of my countenance


    Merely upon myself.
Vexed I am


    Of late with passions of some difference,


    Conceptions only proper to myself,


    Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;


    But let not therefore my good friends be grieved-


    Among which number, Cassius, be you one-


    Nor construe any further my neglect


    Than that poor Brutus with himself at war


    Forgets the shows of love to other men.
CASSIUS.
Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,


    By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried


    Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
BRUTUS.
No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself


    But by reflection, by some other things.
CASSIUS.
'Tis just,


    And it is very much lamented, Brutus,


    That you have no such mirrors as will turn


    Your hidden worthiness into your eye


    That you might see your shadow.
I have heard


    Where many of the best respect in Rome,


    Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus


    And groaning underneath this age's yoke,


    Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
BRUTUS.
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,


    That you would have me seek into myself


    For that which is not in me?
CASSIUS.
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,


    And since you know you cannot see yourself


    So well as by reflection, I your glass


    Will modestly discover to yourself


    That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus;


    Were I a common laugher, or did use


    To stale with ordinary oaths my love


    To every new protester, if you know


    That I do fawn on men and hug them hard


    And after scandal them, or if you know


    That I profess myself in banqueting


    To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
Flourish and shout.
BRUTUS.
What means this shouting?
I do fear the people


    Choose Caesar for their king.
CASSIUS.
Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.
BRUTUS.
I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good,


    Set honor in one eye and death i' the other


    And I will look on both indifferently.
For let the gods so speed me as I love


    The name of honor more than I fear death.
CASSIUS.
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,


    As well as I do know your outward favor.
Well, honor is the subject of my story.
I cannot tell what you and other men


    Think of this life, but, for my single self,


    I had as lief not be as live to be


    In awe of such a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Caesar, so were you;


    We both have fed as well, and we can both


    Endure the winter's cold as well as he.
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,


    The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,


    Caesar said to me, "Darest thou, Cassius, now


    Leap in with me into this angry flood


    And swim to yonder point?"
Upon the word,


    Accoutred as I was, I plunged in


    And bade him follow.
So indeed he did.
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it


    With lusty sinews, throwing it aside


    And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,


    Caesar cried, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink!
I, as Aeneas our great ancestor


    Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder


    The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber


    Did I the tired Caesar.
And this man


    Is now become a god, and Cassius is


    A wretched creature and must bend his body


    If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,


    And when the fit was on him I did mark


    How he did shake.
'Tis true, this god did shake;


    His coward lips did from their color fly,


    And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world


    Did lose his luster.
I did hear him groan.
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans


    Mark him and write his speeches in their books,


    Alas, it cried, "Give me some drink, Titinius,"


    As a sick girl.
Ye gods!
It doth amaze me


    A man of such a feeble temper should


    So get the start of the majestic world


    And bear the palm alone.
Shout.
Flourish.
BRUTUS.
Another general shout!
I do believe that these applauses are


    For some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar.
CASSIUS.
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world


    Like a Colossus, and we petty men


    Walk under his huge legs and peep about


    To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
Men at some time are masters of their fates:


    The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,


    But in ourselves that we are underlings.
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that "Caesar"?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;


    Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;


    Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,


    "Brutus" will start a spirit as soon as "Caesar."
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,


    Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed


    That he is grown so great?
Age, thou art shamed!
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age since the great flood


    But it was famed with more than with one man?
When could they say till now that talk'd of Rome


    That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,


    When there is in it but one only man.
O, you and I have heard our fathers say


    There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd


    The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome


    As easily as a king.
BRUTUS.
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;


    What you would work me to, I have some aim.
How I have thought of this and of these times,


    I shall recount hereafter; for this present,


    I would not, so with love I might entreat you,


    Be any further moved.
What you have said


    I will consider; what you have to say


    I will with patience hear, and find a time


    Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:


    Brutus had rather be a villager


    Than to repute himself a son of Rome


    Under these hard conditions as this time


    Is like to lay upon us.
CASSIUS.
I am glad that my weak words


    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
Re-enter Caesar and his Train.
BRUTUS.
The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
CASSIUS.
As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,


    And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you


    What hath proceeded worthy note today.
BRUTUS.
I will do so.
But, look you, Cassius,


    The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,


    And all the rest look like a chidden train:


    Calpurnia's cheek is pale, and Cicero


    Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes


    As we have seen him in the Capitol,


    Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
CASSIUS.
Casca will tell us what the matter is.
CAESAR.
Antonio!
ANTONY.
Caesar?
CAESAR.
Let me have men about me that are fat,


    Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:


    Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;


    He thinks too much; such men are dangerous.
ANTONY.
Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;


    He is a noble Roman and well given.
CAESAR.
Would he were fatter!
But I fear him not,


    Yet if my name were liable to fear,


    I do not know the man I should avoid


    So soon as that spare Cassius.
He reads much,


    He is a great observer, and he looks


    Quite through the deeds of men.
He loves no plays,


    As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;


    Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort


    As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit


    That could be moved to smile at anything.
Such men as he be never at heart's ease


    Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,


    And therefore are they very dangerous.
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd


    Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar.
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,


    And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
Sennet.
Exeunt Caesar and all his Train but Casca.
CASCA.
You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
BRUTUS.
Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today


    That Caesar looks so sad.
CASCA.
Why, you were with him, were you not?
BRUTUS.
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
CASCA.
Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,


     he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the


     people fell ashouting.
BRUTUS.
What was the second noise for?
CASCA.
Why, for that too.
CASSIUS.
They shouted thrice.
What was the last cry for?
CASCA.
Why, for that too.
BRUTUS.
Was the crown offered him thrice?
CASCA.
Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler


    than other, and at every putting by mine honest neighbors


    shouted.
CASSIUS.
Who offered him the crown?
CASCA.
Why, Antony.
BRUTUS.
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
CASCA.
I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it.
It was


    mere foolery; I did not mark it.
I saw Mark Antony offer him a


    crown (yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these


    coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once.
But for all


    that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it.
Then he offered


    it to him again; then he put it by again.
But, to my thinking, he


    was very loath to lay his fingers off it.
And then he offered it


    the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he


    refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands


    and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of


    stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had


    almost choked Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it.
And


    for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips


    and receiving the bad air.
CASSIUS.
But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
CASCA.
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was


    speechless.
BRUTUS.
'Tis very like.
He hath the falling sickness.
CASSIUS.
No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,


    And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
CASCA.
I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell


    down.
If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him


    according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do


    the players in the theatre, I am no true man.
BRUTUS.
What said he when he came unto himself?
CASCA.
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common


    herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet


    and offered them his throat to cut.
An had been a man of any


    occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I


    might go to hell among the rogues.
And so he fell.
When he came


    to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything amiss,


    he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity.
Three or


    four wenches where I stood cried, "Alas, good soul!"
and forgave


    him with all their hearts.
But there's no heed to be taken of


    them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done


    no less.
BRUTUS.
And after that he came, thus sad, away?
CASCA.
Ay.
CASSIUS.
Did Cicero say anything?
CASCA.
Ay, he spoke Greek.
CASSIUS.
To what effect?
CASCA.
Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face


    again; but those that understood him smiled at one another and


    shook their heads; but for mine own part, it was Greek to me.
I


    could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling


    scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence.
Fare you well.
There was more foolery yet, if could remember it.
CASSIUS.
Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
CASCA.
No, I am promised forth.
CASSIUS.
Will you dine with me tomorrow?
CASCA.
Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth


    the eating.
CASSIUS.
Good, I will expect you.
CASCA.
Do so, farewell, both.
Exit.
BRUTUS.
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
He was quick mettle when he went to school.
CASSIUS.
So is he now in execution


    Of any bold or noble enterprise,


    However he puts on this tardy form.
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,


    Which gives men stomach to digest his words


    With better appetite.
BRUTUS.
And so it is.
For this time I will leave you.
Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,


    I will come home to you, or, if you will,


    Come home to me and I will wait for you.
CASSIUS.
I will do so.
Till then, think of the world.
Exit Brutus.
Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see


    Thy honorable mettle may be wrought


    From that it is disposed; therefore it is meet


    That noble minds keep ever with their likes;


    For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,


    He should not humor me.
I will this night,


    In several hands, in at his windows throw,


    As if they came from several citizens,


    Writings, all tending to the great opinion


    That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely


    Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at.
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;


    For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
Exit.
Enter, from opposite sides, Casca, with his sword drawn, and


Cicero.
CICERO.
Good even, Casca.
Brought you Caesar home?
Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?
CASCA.
Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth


    Shakes like a thing unfirm?
O Cicero,


    I have seen tempests when the scolding winds


    Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen


    The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam


    To be exalted with the threatening clouds,


    But never till tonight, never till now,


    Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,


    Or else the world too saucy with the gods


    Incenses them to send destruction.
CICERO.
Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
CASCA.
A common slave- you know him well by sight-


    Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn


    Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand


    Not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd.
Besides- I ha' not since put up my sword-


    Against the Capitol I met a lion,


    Who glaz'd upon me and went surly by


    Without annoying me.
And there were drawn


    Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women


    Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw


    Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
And yesterday the bird of night did sit


    Even at noonday upon the marketplace,


    Howling and shrieking.
When these prodigies


    Do so conjointly meet, let not men say


    "These are their reasons; they are natural":


    For I believe they are portentous things


    Unto the climate that they point upon.
CICERO.
Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
But men may construe things after their fashion,


    Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?
CASCA.
He doth, for he did bid Antonio


    Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.
CICERO.
Good then, Casca.
This disturbed sky


    Is not to walk in.
CASCA.
Farewell, Cicero.
Exit Cicero.
Enter Cassius.
CASSIUS.
Who's there?
CASCA.
A Roman.
CASSIUS.
Casca, by your voice.
CASCA.
Your ear is good.
Cassius, what night is this!
CASSIUS.
A very pleasing night to honest men.
CASCA.
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
CASSIUS.
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,


    Submitting me unto the perilous night,


    And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,


    Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone;


    And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open


    The breast of heaven, I did present myself


    Even in the aim and very flash of it.
CASCA.
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
It is the part of men to fear and tremble


    When the most mighty gods by tokens send


    Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
CASSIUS.
You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life


    That should be in a Roman you do want,


    Or else you use not.
You look pale and gaze


    And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder


    To see the strange impatience of the heavens.
But if you would consider the true cause


    Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,


    Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,


    Why old men, fools, and children calculate,


    Why all these things change from their ordinance,


    Their natures, and preformed faculties


    To monstrous quality, why, you shall find


    That heaven hath infused them with these spirits


    To make them instruments of fear and warning


    Unto some monstrous state.
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man


    Most like this dreadful night,


    That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars


    As doth the lion in the Capitol,


    A man no mightier than thyself or me


    In personal action, yet prodigious grown


    And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
CASCA.
'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
CASSIUS.
Let it be who it is, for Romans now


    Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.
But, woe the while!
Our fathers' minds are dead,


    And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;


    Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
CASCA.
Indeed they say the senators tomorrow


    Mean to establish Caesar as a king,


    And he shall wear his crown by sea and land


    In every place save here in Italy.
CASSIUS.
I know where I will wear this dagger then:


    Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;


    Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,


    Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron


    Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;


    But life, being weary of these worldly bars,


    Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
If I know this, know all the world besides,


    That part of tyranny that I do bear


    I can shake off at pleasure.
Thunder still.
CASCA.
So can I.
So every bondman in his own hand bears


    The power to cancel his captivity.
CASSIUS.
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
Poor man!
I know he would not be a wolf


    But that he sees the Romans are but sheep.
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire


    Begin it with weak straws.
What trash is Rome,


    What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves


    For the base matter to illuminate


    So vile a thing as Caesar?
But, O grief,


    Where hast thou led me?
I perhaps speak this


    Before a willing bondman; then I know


    My answer must be made.
But I am arm'd,


    And dangers are to me indifferent.
CASCA.
You speak to Casca, and to such a man


    That is no fleering tell-tale.
Hold, my hand.
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,


    And I will set this foot of mine as far


    As who goes farthest.
CASSIUS.
There's a bargain made.
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already


    Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans


    To undergo with me an enterprise


    Of honorable-dangerous consequence;


    And I do know by this, they stay for me


    In Pompey's Porch.
For now, this fearful night,


    There is no stir or walking in the streets,


    And the complexion of the element


    In favor's like the work we have in hand,


    Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
Enter Cinna.
CASCA.
Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
CASSIUS.
'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;


    He is a friend.
Cinna, where haste you so?
CINNA.
To find out you.
Who's that?
Metellus Cimber?
CASSIUS.
No, it is Casca, one incorporate


    To our attempts.
Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
CINNA.
I am glad on't.
What a fearful night is this!
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
CASSIUS.
Am I not stay'd for?
Tell me.
CINNA.
Yes, you are.
O Cassius, if you could


    But win the noble Brutus to our party-


  CASSIUS.
Be you content.
Good Cinna, take this paper,


    And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,


    Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this


    In at his window; set this up with wax


    Upon old Brutus' statue.
All this done,


    Repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us.
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
CINNA.
All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone


    To seek you at your house.
Well, I will hie


    And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
CASSIUS.
That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
Exit Cinna.
Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day


    See Brutus at his house.
Three parts of him


    Is ours already, and the man entire


    Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
CASCA.
O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,


    And that which would appear offense in us,


    His countenance, like richest alchemy,


    Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
CASSIUS.
Him and his worth and our great need of him


    You have right well conceited.
Let us go,


    For it is after midnight, and ere day


    We will awake him and be sure of him.
Exeunt.

Enter Brutus in his orchard.
BRUTUS.
What, Lucius, ho!
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,


    Give guess how near to day.
Lucius, I say!
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
When, Lucius, when?
Awake, I say!
What, Lucius!
Enter Lucius.
LUCIUS.
Call'd you, my lord?
BRUTUS.
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
When it is lighted, come and call me here.
LUCIUS.
I will, my lord.
Exit.
BRUTUS.
It must be by his death, and, for my part,


    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,


    But for the general.
He would be crown'd:


    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder


    And that craves wary walking.
Crown him that,


    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him


    That at his will he may do danger with.
The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins


    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,


    I have not known when his affections sway'd


    More than his reason.
But 'tis a common proof


    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,


    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;


    But when he once attains the upmost round,


    He then unto the ladder turns his back,


    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees


    By which he did ascend.
So Caesar may;


    Then, lest he may, prevent.
And, since the quarrel


    Will bear no color for the thing he is,


    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,


    Would run to these and these extremities;


    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg


    Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,


    And kill him in the shell.
Re-enter Lucius.
LUCIUS.
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
Searching the window for a flint I found


    This paper thus seal'd up, and I am sure


    It did not lie there when I went to bed.
Gives him the letter.
BRUTUS.
Get you to bed again, it is not day.
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?
LUCIUS.
I know not, sir.
BRUTUS.
Look in the calendar and bring me word.
LUCIUS.
I will, sir.
Exit.
BRUTUS.
The exhalations whizzing in the air


    Give so much light that I may read by them.
Opens the letter and reads.
"Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
Shall Rome, etc.
Speak, strike, redress!"
"Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!"
Such instigations have been often dropp'd


    Where I have took them up.
"Shall Rome, etc."
Thus must I piece it out.
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe?
What, Rome?
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome


    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
"Speak, strike, redress!"
Am I entreated


    To speak and strike?
O Rome, I make thee promise,


    If the redress will follow, thou receivest


    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
Re-enter Lucius.
LUCIUS.
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
Knocking within.
BRUTUS.
'Tis good.
Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
Exit Lucius.
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar


    I have not slept.
Between the acting of a dreadful thing


    And the first motion, all the interim is


    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;


    The genius and the mortal instruments


    Are then in council, and the state of man,


    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then


    The nature of an insurrection.
Re-enter Lucius.
LUCIUS.
Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,


    Who doth desire to see you.
BRUTUS.
Is he alone?
LUCIUS.
No, sir, there are more with him.
BRUTUS.
Do you know them?
LUCIUS.
No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,


    And half their faces buried in their cloaks,


    That by no means I may discover them


    By any mark of favor.
BRUTUS.
Let 'em enter.
Exit Lucius.
They are the faction.
O Conspiracy,


    Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,


    When evils are most free?
O, then, by day


    Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough


    To mask thy monstrous visage?
Seek none, Conspiracy;


    Hide it in smiles and affability;


    For if thou path, thy native semblance on,


    Not Erebus itself were dim enough


    To hide thee from prevention.
Enter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna,


                Metellus Cimber, and Trebonius.
CASSIUS.
I think we are too bold upon your rest.
Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?
BRUTUS.
I have been up this hour, awake all night.
Know I these men that come along with you?
CASSIUS.
Yes, every man of them, and no man here


    But honors you, and every one doth wish


    You had but that opinion of yourself


    Which every noble Roman bears of you.
This is Trebonius.
BRUTUS.
He is welcome hither.
CASSIUS.
This, Decius Brutus.
BRUTUS.
He is welcome too.
CASSIUS.
This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.
BRUTUS.
They are all welcome.
What watchful cares do interpose themselves


    Betwixt your eyes and night?
CASSIUS.
Shall I entreat a word?
They whisper.
DECIUS.
Here lies the east.
Doth not the day break here?
CASCA.
No.
CINNA.
O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines


    That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
CASCA.
You shall confess that you are both deceived.
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,


    Which is a great way growing on the south,


    Weighing the youthful season of the year.
Some two months hence up higher toward the north


    He first presents his fire, and the high east


    Stands as the Capitol, directly here.
BRUTUS.
Give me your hands all over, one by one.
CASSIUS.
And let us swear our resolution.
BRUTUS.
No, not an oath.
If not the face of men,


    The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse-


    If these be motives weak, break off betimes,


    And every man hence to his idle bed;


    So let high-sighted tyranny range on


    Till each man drop by lottery.
But if these,


    As I am sure they do, bear fire enough


    To kindle cowards and to steel with valor


    The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,


    What need we any spur but our own cause


    To prick us to redress?
What other bond


    Than secret Romans that have spoke the word


    And will not palter?
And what other oath


    Than honesty to honesty engaged


    That this shall be or we will fall for it?
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,


    Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls


    That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear


    Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain


    The even virtue of our enterprise,


    Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,


    To think that or our cause or our performance


    Did need an oath; when every drop of blood


    That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,


    Is guilty of a several bastardy


    If he do break the smallest particle


    Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
CASSIUS.
But what of Cicero?
Shall we sound him?
I think he will stand very strong with us.
CASCA.
Let us not leave him out.
CINNA.
No, by no means.
METELLUS.
O, let us have him, for his silver hairs


    Will purchase us a good opinion,


    And buy men's voices to commend our deeds.
It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands;


    Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,


    But all be buried in his gravity.
BRUTUS.
O, name him not; let us not break with him,


    For he will never follow anything


    That other men begin.
CASSIUS.
Then leave him out.
CASCA.
Indeed he is not fit.
DECIUS.
Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
CASSIUS.
Decius, well urged.
I think it is not meet


    Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,


    Should outlive Caesar.
We shall find of him


    A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,


    If he improve them, may well stretch so far


    As to annoy us all, which to prevent,


    Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
BRUTUS.
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,


    To cut the head off and then hack the limbs


    Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;


    For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,


    And in the spirit of men there is no blood.
O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,


    And not dismember Caesar!
But, alas,


    Caesar must bleed for it!
And, gentle friends,


    Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;


    Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,


    Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;


    And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,


    Stir up their servants to an act of rage


    And after seem to chide 'em.
This shall make


    Our purpose necessary and not envious,


    Which so appearing to the common eyes,


    We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
And for Mark Antony, think not of him,


    For he can do no more than Caesar's arm


    When Caesar's head is off.
CASSIUS.
Yet I fear him,


    For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar-


  BRUTUS.
Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
If he love Caesar, all that he can do


    Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar.
And that were much he should, for he is given


    To sports, to wildness, and much company.
TREBONIUS.
There is no fear in him-let him not die,


    For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.
Clock strikes.
BRUTUS.
Peace, count the clock.
CASSIUS.
The clock hath stricken three.
TREBONIUS.
'Tis time to part.
CASSIUS.
But it is doubtful yet


    Whether Caesar will come forth today or no,


    For he is superstitious grown of late,


    Quite from the main opinion he held once


    Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.
It may be these apparent prodigies,


    The unaccustom'd terror of this night,


    And the persuasion of his augurers


    May hold him from the Capitol today.
DECIUS.
Never fear that.
If he be so resolved,


    I can o'ersway him, for he loves to hear


    That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,


    And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,


    Lions with toils, and men with flatterers;


    But when I tell him he hates flatterers,


    He says he does, being then most flattered.
Let me work;


    For I can give his humor the true bent,


    And I will bring him to the Capitol.
CASSIUS.
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
BRUTUS.
By the eighth hour.
Is that the utter most?
CINNA.
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
METELLUS.
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,


    Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.
I wonder none of you have thought of him.
BRUTUS.
Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;


    Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
CASSIUS.
The morning comes upon 's.
We'll leave you, Brutus,


    And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember


    What you have said and show yourselves true Romans.
BRUTUS.
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;


    Let not our looks put on our purposes,


    But bear it as our Roman actors do,


    With untired spirits and formal constancy.
And so, good morrow to you every one.
Exeunt all but Brutus.
Boy!
Lucius!
Fast asleep?
It is no matter.
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;


    Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,


    Which busy care draws in the brains of men;


    Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
Enter Portia.
PORTIA.
Brutus, my lord!
BRUTUS.
Portia, what mean you?
Wherefore rise you now?
It is not for your health thus to commit


    Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
PORTIA.
Nor for yours neither.
have ungently, Brutus,


    Stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper


    You suddenly arose and walk'd about,


    Musing and sighing, with your arms across;


    And when I ask'd you what the matter was,


    You stared upon me with ungentle looks.
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,


    And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot.
Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,


    But with an angry waiter of your hand


    Gave sign for me to leave you.
So I did,


    Fearing to strengthen that impatience


    Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal


    Hoping it was but an effect of humor,


    Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,


    And, could it work so much upon your shape


    As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,


    I should not know you, Brutus.
Dear my lord,


    Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
BRUTUS.
I am not well in health, and that is all.
PORTIA.
Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,


    He would embrace the means to come by it.
BRUTUS.
Why, so I do.
Good Portia, go to bed.
PORTIA.
Is Brutus sick, and is it physical


    To walk unbraced and suck up the humors


    Of the dank morning?
What, is Brutus sick,


    And will he steal out of his wholesome bed


    To dare the vile contagion of the night


    And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air


    To add unto his sickness?
No, my Brutus,


    You have some sick offense within your mind,


    Which by the right and virtue of my place


    I ought to know of; and, upon my knees,


    I charm you, by my once commended beauty,


    By all your vows of love and that great vow


    Which did incorporate and make us one,


    That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,


    Why you are heavy and what men tonight


    Have had resort to you; for here have been


    Some six or seven, who did hide their faces


    Even from darkness.
BRUTUS.
Kneel not, gentle Portia.
PORTIA.
I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,


    Is it excepted I should know no secrets


    That appertain to you?
Am I yourself


    But, as it were, in sort or limitation,


    To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,


    And talk to you sometimes?
Dwell I but in the suburbs


    Of your good pleasure?
If it be no more,


    Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
BRUTUS.
You are my true and honorable wife,


    As dear to me as are the ruddy drops


    That visit my sad heart.
PORTIA.
If this were true, then should I know this secret.
I grant I am a woman, but withal


    A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
I grant I am a woman, but withal


    A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,


    Being so father'd and so husbanded?
Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em.
I have made strong proof of my constancy,


    Giving myself a voluntary wound


    Here in the thigh.
Can I bear that with patience


    And not my husband's secrets?
BRUTUS.
O ye gods,


    Render me worthy of this noble wife!
Knocking within.
Hark, hark, one knocks.
Portia, go in awhile,


    And by and by thy bosom shall partake


    The secrets of my heart.
All my engagements I will construe to thee,


    All the charactery of my sad brows.
Leave me with haste.
[Exit Portia.]
Lucius, who's that knocks?
Re-enter Lucius with Ligarius.
LUCIUS.
Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
BRUTUS.
Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
Boy, stand aside.
Caius Ligarius, how?
LIGARIUS.
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
BRUTUS.
O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,


    To wear a kerchief!
Would you were not sick!
LIGARIUS.
I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand


    Any exploit worthy the name of honor.
BRUTUS.
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,


    Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
LIGARIUS.
By all the gods that Romans bow before,


    I here discard my sickness!
Soul of Rome!
Brave son, derived from honorable loins!
Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up


    My mortified spirit.
Now bid me run,


    And I will strive with things impossible,


    Yea, get the better of them.
What's to do?
BRUTUS.
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
LIGARIUS.
But are not some whole that we must make sick?
BRUTUS.
That must we also.
What it is, my Caius,


    I shall unfold to thee, as we are going


    To whom it must be done.
LIGARIUS.
Set on your foot,


    And with a heart new-fired I follow you,


    To do I know not what; but it sufficeth


    That Brutus leads me on.
BRUTUS.
Follow me then.
Exeunt.
Enter Caesar, in his nightgown.
CAESAR.
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,


    "Help, ho!
They murther Caesar!"
Who's within?
Enter a Servant.
SERVANT.
My lord?
CAESAR.
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,


    And bring me their opinions of success.
SERVANT.
I will, my lord.
Exit.
Enter Calpurnia.
CALPURNIA.
What mean you, Caesar?
Think you to walk forth?
You shall not stir out of your house today.
CAESAR.
Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me


    Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see


    The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
CALPURNIA.
Caesar, I I stood on ceremonies,


    Yet now they fright me.
There is one within,


    Besides the things that we have heard and seen,


    Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;


    And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;


    Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds,


    In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,


    Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;


    The noise of battle hurtled in the air,


    Horses did neigh and dying men did groan,


    And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
O Caesar!
These things are beyond all use,


    And I do fear them.
CAESAR.
What can be avoided


    Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions


    Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
CALPURNIA.
When beggars die, there are no comets seen;


    The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
CAESAR.
Cowards die many times before their deaths;


    The valiant never taste of death but once.
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,


    It seems to me most strange that men should fear


    Seeing that death, a necessary end,


    Will come when it will come.
Re-enter Servant.
What say the augurers?
SERVANT.
They would not have you to stir forth today.
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,


    They could not find a heart within the beast.
CAESAR.
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.
Caesar should be a beast without a heart


    If he should stay at home today for fear.
No, Caesar shall not.
Danger knows full well


    That Caesar is more dangerous than he.
We are two lions litter'd in one day,


    And I the elder and more terrible.
And Caesar shall go forth.
CALPURNIA.
Alas, my lord,


    Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
Do not go forth today.
Call it my fear


    That keeps you in the house and not your own.
We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House,


    And he shall say you are not well today.
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
CAESAR.
Mark Antony shall say I am not well,


    And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.
Enter Decius.
Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.
DECIUS.
Caesar, all hail!
Good morrow, worthy Caesar!
I come to fetch you to the Senate House.
CAESAR.
And you are come in very happy time


    To bear my greeting to the senators


    And tell them that I will not come today.
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:


    I will not come today.
Tell them so, Decius.
CALPURNIA.
Say he is sick.
CAESAR.
Shall Caesar send a lie?
Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far


    To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth?
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
DECIUS.
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,


    Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
CAESAR.
The cause is in my will: I will not come,


    That is enough to satisfy the Senate.
But, for your private satisfaction,


    Because I love you, I will let you know.
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home;


    She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,


    Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,


    Did run pure blood, and many lusty Romans


    Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.
And these does she apply for warnings and portents


    And evils imminent, and on her knee


    Hath begg'd that I will stay at home today.
DECIUS.
This dream is all amiss interpreted;


    It was a vision fair and fortunate.
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,


    In which so many smiling Romans bathed,


    Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck


    Reviving blood, and that great men shall press


    For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
CAESAR.
And this way have you well expounded it.
DECIUS.
I have, when you have heard what I can say.
And know it now, the Senate have concluded


    To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
If you shall send them word you will not come,


    Their minds may change.
Besides, it were a mock


    Apt to be render'd, for someone to say


    "Break up the Senate till another time,


    When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams."
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper


    "Lo, Caesar is afraid"?
Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love


    To your proceeding bids me tell you this,


    And reason to my love is liable.
CAESAR.
How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
Give me my robe, for I will go.
Enter Publius, Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca,


                     Trebonius, and Cinna.
And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
PUBLIUS.
Good morrow,Caesar.
CAESAR.
Welcome, Publius.
What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
Good morrow, Casca.
Caius Ligarius,


    Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy


    As that same ague which hath made you lean.
What is't o'clock?
BRUTUS.
Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
CAESAR.
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
Enter Antony.
See, Antony, that revels long o' nights,


    Is notwithstanding up.
Good morrow, Antony.
ANTONY.
So to most noble Caesar.
CAESAR.
Bid them prepare within.
I am to blame to be thus waited for.
Now, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius,


    I have an hour's talk in store for you;


    Remember that you call on me today;


    Be near me, that I may remember you.
TREBONIUS.
Caesar, I will.
[Aside.]
And so near will I be


    That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
CAESAR.
Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me,


    And we like friends will straightway go together.
BRUTUS.
[Aside.]
That every like is not the same, O Caesar,


    The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!
Exeunt.
Enter Artemidorus, reading paper.
ARTEMIDORUS.
"Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; come


    not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius; mark


    well Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast


    wronged Caius Ligarius.
There is but one mind in all these men,


    and it is bent against Caesar.
If thou beest not immortal, look


    about you.
Security gives way to conspiracy.
The mighty gods


    defend thee!
Thy lover, Artemidorus."
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,


    And as a suitor will I give him this.
My heart laments that virtue cannot live


    Out of the teeth of emulation.
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live;


    If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
Exit.
Enter Portia and Lucius.
PORTIA.
I prithee, boy, run to the Senate House;


    Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
Why dost thou stay?
LUCIUS.
To know my errand, madam.
PORTIA.
I would have had thee there, and here again,


    Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
O constancy, be strong upon my side!
Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
Art thou here yet?
LUCIUS.
Madam, what should I do?
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
And so return to you, and nothing else?
PORTIA.
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,


    For he went sickly forth; and take good note


    What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
Hark, boy, what noise is that?
LUCIUS.
I hear none, madam.
PORTIA.
Prithee, listen well.
I heard a bustling rumor like a fray,


    And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
LUCIUS.
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
Enter the Soothsayer.
PORTIA.
Come hither, fellow;


    Which way hast thou been?
SOOTHSAYER.
At mine own house, good lady.
PORTIA.
What is't o'clock?
SOOTHSAYER.
About the ninth hour, lady.
PORTIA.
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
SOOTHSAYER.
Madam, not yet.
I go to take my stand


    To see him pass on to the Capitol.
PORTIA.
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
SOOTHSAYER.
That I have, lady.
If it will please Caesar


    To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,


    I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
PORTIA.
Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
SOOTHSAYER.
None that I know will be, much that I fear may


chance.
Good morrow to you.
Here the street is narrow,


    The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,


    Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,


    Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
I'll get me to a place more void and there


    Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
Exit.
PORTIA.
I must go in.
Ay me, how weak a thing


    The heart of woman is!
O Brutus,


    The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
Sure, the boy heard me.
Brutus hath a suit


    That Caesar will not grant.
O, I grow faint.
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;


    Say I am merry.
Come to me again,


    And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
Exeunt severally.

Flourish.
Enter Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus,


Trebonius, Cinna, Antony, Lepidus, Popilius, Publius, and others.
CAESAR.
The ides of March are come.
SOOTHSAYER.
Ay, Caesar, but not gone.
A Hail, Caesar!
Read this schedule.
DECIUS.
Trebonius doth desire you to o'er read,


    At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
ARTEMIDORUS.
O Caesar, read mine first, for mine's a suit


    That touches Caesar nearer.
Read it, great Caesar.
CAESAR.
What touches us ourself shall be last served.
ARTEMIDORUS.
Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
CAESAR.
What, is the fellow mad?
PUBLIUS.
Sirrah, give place.
CASSIUS.
What, urge you your petitions in the street?
Come to the Capitol.
Caesar goes up to the Senate House, the rest follow.
POPILIUS.
I wish your enterprise today may thrive.
CASSIUS.
What enterprise, Popilius?
POPILIUS.
Fare you well.
Advances to Caesar.
BRUTUS.
What said Popilius Lena?
CASSIUS.
He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive.
I fear our purpose is discovered.
BRUTUS.
Look, how he makes to Caesar.
Mark him.
CASSIUS.
Casca,


    Be sudden, for we fear prevention.
Brutus, what shall be done?
If this be known,


    Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,


    For I will slay myself.
BRUTUS.
Cassius, be constant.
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;


    For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
CASSIUS.
Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus,


    He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
Exeunt Antony and Trebonius.
DECIUS.
Where is Metellus Cimber?
Let him


    And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
BRUTUS.
He is address'd; press near and second him.
CINNA.
Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
CAESAR.
Are we all ready?
What is now amiss


    That Caesar and his Senate must redress?
METELLUS.
Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,


    Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat


    An humble heart.
Kneels.
CAESAR.
I must prevent thee, Cimber.
These couchings and these lowly courtesies


    Might fire the blood of ordinary men


    And turn preordinance and first decree


    Into the law of children.
Be not fond


    To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood


    That will be thaw'd from the true quality


    With that which melteth fools- I mean sweet words,


    Low-crooked court'sies, and base spaniel-fawning.
Thy brother by decree is banished.
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,


    I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause


    Will he be satisfied.
METELLUS.
Is there no voice more worthy than my own,


    To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear


    For the repealing of my banish'd brother?
BRUTUS.
I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,


    Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may


    Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
CAESAR.
What, Brutus?
CASSIUS.
Pardon, Caesar!
Caesar, pardon!
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall


    To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
CAESAR.
I could be well moved, if I were as you;


    If I could pray to move, prayers would move me;


    But I am constant as the northern star,


    Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality


    There is no fellow in the firmament.
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks;


    They are all fire and every one doth shine;


    But there's but one in all doth hold his place.
So in the world, 'tis furnish'd well with men,


    And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;


    Yet in the number I do know but one


    That unassailable holds on his rank,


    Unshaked of motion; and that I am he,


    Let me a little show it, even in this;


    That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,


    And constant do remain to keep him so.
CINNA.
O Caesar-


  CAESAR.
Hence!
Wilt thou lift up Olympus?
DECIUS.
Great Caesar-


  CAESAR.
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
CASCA.
Speak, hands, for me!
Casca first, then the other Conspirators


                                  and Marcus Brutus stab Caesar.
CAESAR.
Et tu, Brute?- Then fall, Caesar!
Dies.
CINNA.
Liberty!
Freedom!
Tyranny is dead!
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
CASSIUS.
Some to the common pulpits and cry out


    "Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!"
BRUTUS.
People and senators, be not affrighted,


    Fly not, stand still; ambition's debt is paid.
CASCA.
Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
DECIUS.
And Cassius too.
BRUTUS.
Where's Publius?
CINNA.
Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
METELLUS.
Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's


    Should chance-


  BRUTUS.
Talk not of standing.
Publius, good cheer,


    There is no harm intended to your person,


    Nor to no Roman else.
So tell them, Publius.
CASSIUS.
And leave us, Publius, lest that the people


    Rushing on us should do your age some mischief.
BRUTUS.
Do so, and let no man abide this deed


    But we the doers.
Re-enter Trebonius.
CASSIUS.
Where is Antony?
TREBONIUS.
Fled to his house amazed.
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run


    As it were doomsday.
BRUTUS.
Fates, we will know your pleasures.
That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time


    And drawing days out that men stand upon.
CASSIUS.
Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life


    Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
BRUTUS.
Grant that, and then is death a benefit;


    So are we Caesar's friends that have abridged


    His time of fearing death.
Stoop, Romans, stoop,


    And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood


    Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords;


    Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,


    And waving our red weapons o'er our heads,


    Let's all cry, "Peace, freedom, and liberty!"
CASSIUS.
Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence


    Shall this our lofty scene be acted over


    In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
BRUTUS.
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,


    That now on Pompey's basis lies along


    No worthier than the dust!
CASSIUS.
So oft as that shall be,


    So often shall the knot of us be call'd


    The men that gave their country liberty.
DECIUS.
What, shall we forth?
CASSIUS.
Ay, every man away.
Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels


    With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
Enter a Servant.
BRUTUS.
Soft, who comes here?
A friend of Antony's.
SERVANT.
Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel,


    Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,


    And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:


    Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;


    Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.
Say I love Brutus and I honor him;


    Say I fear'd Caesar, honor'd him, and loved him.
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony


    May safely come to him and be resolved


    How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,


    Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead


    So well as Brutus living, but will follow


    The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus


    Thorough the hazards of this untrod state


    With all true faith.
So says my master Antony.
BRUTUS.
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;


    I never thought him worse.
Tell him, so please him come unto this place,


    He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,


    Depart untouch'd.
SERVANT.
I'll fetch him presently.
Exit.
BRUTUS.
I know that we shall have him well to friend.
CASSIUS.
I wish we may, but yet have I a mind


    That fears him much, and my misgiving still


    Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
Re-enter Antony.
BRUTUS.
But here comes Antony.
Welcome, Mark Antony.
ANTONY.
O mighty Caesar!
Dost thou lie so low?
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,


    Shrunk to this little measure?
Fare thee well.
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,


    Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.
If I myself, there is no hour so fit


    As Caesar's death's hour, nor no instrument


    Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich


    With the most noble blood of all this world.
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,


    Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,


    Fulfill your pleasure.
Live a thousand years,


    I shall not find myself so apt to die;


    No place will please me so, no means of death,


    As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,


    The choice and master spirits of this age.
BRUTUS.
O Antony, beg not your death of us!
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,


    As, by our hands and this our present act


    You see we do, yet see you but our hands


    And this the bleeding business they have done.
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;


    And pity to the general wrong of Rome-


    As fire drives out fire, so pity pity-


    Hath done this deed on Caesar.
For your part,


    To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;


    Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts


    Of brothers' temper, do receive you in


    With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
CASSIUS.
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's


    In the disposing of new dignities.
BRUTUS.
Only be patient till we have appeased


    The multitude, beside themselves with fear,


    And then we will deliver you the cause


    Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,


    Have thus proceeded.
ANTONY.
I doubt not of your wisdom.
Let each man render me his bloody hand.
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;


    Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;


    Now, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus;


    Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;


    Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.
Gentlemen all- alas, what shall I say?
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,


    That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,


    Either a coward or a flatterer.
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true!
If then thy spirit look upon us now,


    Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death


    To see thy Antony making his peace,


    Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,


    Most noble!
In the presence of thy corse?
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,


    Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,


    It would become me better than to close


    In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
Pardon me, Julius!
Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart,


    Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand,


    Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy Lethe.
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart,


    And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
How like a deer strucken by many princes


    Dost thou here lie!
CASSIUS.
Mark Antony-


  ANTONY.
Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
The enemies of Caesar shall say this:


    Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
CASSIUS.
I blame you not for praising Caesar so;


    But what compact mean you to have with us?
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends,


    Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
ANTONY.
Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed


    Sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar.
Friends am I with you all and love you all,


    Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons


    Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
BRUTUS.
Or else were this a savage spectacle.
Our reasons are so full of good regard


    That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,


    You should be satisfied.
ANTONY.
That's all I seek;


    And am moreover suitor that I may


    Produce his body to the marketplace,


    And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,


    Speak in the order of his funeral.
BRUTUS.
You shall, Mark Antony.
CASSIUS.
Brutus, a word with you.
[Aside to Brutus.]
You know not what you do.
Do not consent


    That Antony speak in his funeral.
Know you how much the people may be moved


    By that which he will utter?
BRUTUS.
By your pardon,


    I will myself into the pulpit first,


    And show the reason of our Caesar's death.
What Antony shall speak, I will protest


    He speaks by leave and by permission,


    And that we are contented Caesar shall


    Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
CASSIUS.
I know not what may fall; I like it not.
BRUTUS.
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,


    But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,


    And say you do't by our permission,


    Else shall you not have any hand at all


    About his funeral.
And you shall speak


    In the same pulpit whereto I am going,


    After my speech is ended.
ANTONY.
Be it so,


    I do desire no more.
BRUTUS.
Prepare the body then, and follow us.
Exeunt all but Antony.
ANTONY.
O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,


    That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man


    That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy


    (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips


    To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)


    A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;


    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife


    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;


    Blood and destruction shall be so in use,


    And dreadful objects so familiar,


    That mothers shall but smile when they behold


    Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;


    All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,


    And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,


    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,


    Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice


    Cry "Havoc!"
and let slip the dogs of war,


    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth


    With carrion men, groaning for burial.
Enter a Servant.
You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
SERVANT.
I do, Mark Antony.
ANTONY.
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
SERVANT.
He did receive his letters, and is coming,


    And bid me say to you by word of mouth-


    O Caesar!
Sees the body.
ANTONY.
Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,


    Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,


    Began to water.
Is thy master coming?
SERVANT.
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
ANTONY.
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,


    No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;


    Hie hence, and tell him so.
Yet stay awhile,


    Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse


    Into the marketplace.
There shall I try,


    In my oration, how the people take


    The cruel issue of these bloody men,


    According to the which thou shalt discourse


    To young Octavius of the state of things.
Lend me your hand.
Exeunt with Caesar's body.
Enter Brutus and Cassius, and a throng of Citizens.
CITIZENS.
We will be satisfied!
Let us be satisfied!
BRUTUS.
Then follow me and give me audience, friends.
Cassius, go you into the other street


    And part the numbers.
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;


    Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;


    And public reasons shall be rendered


    Of Caesar's death.
FIRST CITIZEN.
I will hear Brutus speak.
SECOND CITIZEN.
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons,


    When severally we hear them rendered.
Exit Cassius, with some Citizens.
Brutus goes into the pulpit.
THIRD CITIZEN.
The noble Brutus is ascended.
Silence!
BRUTUS.
Be patient till the last.
Romans, countrymen, and lovers!
Hear me for my cause, and be


    silent, that you may hear.
Believe me for mine honor, and have


    respect to mine honor, that you may believe.
Censure me in your


    wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
If


    there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's, to


    him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his.
If


    then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is


    my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome


    more.
Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves, than


    that Caesar were dead to live all freemen?
As Caesar loved me, I


    weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was


    valiant, I honor him; but as he was ambitious, I slew him.
There


    is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor,


    and death for his ambition.
Who is here so base that would be a


    bondman?
If any, speak, for him have I offended.
Who is here so


    rude that would not be a Roman?
If any, speak, for him have I


    offended.
Who is here so vile that will not love his country?
If


    any, speak, for him have I offended.
I pause for a reply.
ALL.
None, Brutus, none.
BRUTUS.
Then none have I offended.
I have done no more to Caesar


    than you shall do to Brutus.
The question of his death is


    enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was


    worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death.
Enter Antony and others, with Caesar's body.
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had


    no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a


    place in the commonwealth, as which of you shall not?
With this I


    depart- that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I


    have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country


    to need my death.
ALL.
Live, Brutus, live, live!
FIRST CITIZEN.
Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Give him a statue with his ancestors.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Let him be Caesar.
FOURTH CITIZEN.
Caesar's better parts


    Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
FIRST CITIZEN.
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and


    clamors.
BRUTUS.
My countrymen-


  SECOND CITIZEN.
Peace!
Silence!
Brutus speaks.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Peace, ho!
BRUTUS.
Good countrymen, let me depart alone,


    And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.
Do grace to Caesar's corse, and grace his speech


    Tending to Caesar's glories, which Mark Antony,


    By our permission, is allow'd to make.
I do entreat you, not a man depart,


    Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
Exit.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Let him go up into the public chair;


    We'll hear him.
Noble Antony, go up.
ANTONY.
For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
Goes into the pulpit.
FOURTH CITIZEN.
What does he say of Brutus?
THIRD CITIZEN.
He says, for Brutus' sake,


    He finds himself beholding to us all.
FOURTH CITIZEN.
'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
FIRST CITIZEN.
This Caesar was a tyrant.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Nay, that's certain.
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Peace!
Let us hear what Antony can say.
ANTONY.
You gentle Romans-


  ALL.
Peace, ho!
Let us hear him.
ANTONY.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them,


    The good is oft interred with their bones;


    So let it be with Caesar.
The noble Brutus


    Hath told you Caesar was ambitious;


    If it were so, it was a grievous fault,


    And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-


    For Brutus is an honorable man;


    So are they all, all honorable men-


    Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me;


    But Brutus says he was ambitious,


    And Brutus is an honorable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,


    Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;


    Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:


    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,


    And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal


    I thrice presented him a kingly crown,


    Which he did thrice refuse.
Was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,


    And sure he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,


    But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause;


    What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,


    And men have lost their reason.
Bear with me;


    My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,


    And I must pause till it come back to me.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
SECOND CITIZEN.
If thou consider rightly of the matter,


    Caesar has had great wrong.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Has he, masters?
I fear there will a worse come in his place.
FOURTH CITIZEN.
Mark'd ye his words?
He would not take the crown;


    Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
FIRST CITIZEN.
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
THIRD CITIZEN.
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
FOURTH CITIZEN.
Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
ANTONY.
But yesterday the word of Caesar might


    Have stood against the world.
Now lies he there,


    And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters!
If I were disposed to stir


    Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,


    I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,


    Who, you all know, are honorable men.
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose


    To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,


    Than I will wrong such honorable men.
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;


    I found it in his closet, 'tis his will.
Let but the commons hear this testament-


    Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read-


    And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds


    And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,


    Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,


    And, dying, mention it within their wills,


    Bequeathing it as a rich legacy


    Unto their issue.
FOURTH CITIZEN.
We'll hear the will.
Read it, Mark Antony.
ALL.
The will, the will!
We will hear Caesar's will.
ANTONY.
Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;


    It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;


    And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,


    It will inflame you, it will make you mad.
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,


    For if you should, O, what would come of it!
FOURTH CITIZEN.
Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony.
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
ANTONY.
Will you be patient?
Will you stay awhile?
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.
I fear I wrong the honorable men


    Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.
FOURTH CITIZEN.
They were traitors.
Honorable men!
ALL.
The will!
The testament!
SECOND CITIZEN.
They were villains, murtherers.
The will!
Read the will!
ANTONY.
You will compel me then to read the will?
Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar,


    And let me show you him that made the will.
Shall I descend?
And will you give me leave?
ALL.
Come down.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Descend.
He comes down from the pulpit.
THIRD CITIZEN.
You shall have leave.
FOURTH CITIZEN.
A ring, stand round.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
ANTONY.
Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.
ALL.
Stand back; room, bear back!
ANTONY.
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle.
I remember


    The first time ever Caesar put it on;


    'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,


    That day he overcame the Nervii.
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through;


    See what a rent the envious Casca made;


    Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;


    And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,


    Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,


    As rushing out of doors, to be resolved


    If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;


    For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel.
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all;


    For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,


    Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,


    Quite vanquish'd him.
Then burst his mighty heart,


    And, in his mantle muffling up his face,


    Even at the base of Pompey's statue,


    Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,


    Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel


    The dint of pity.
These are gracious drops.
Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold


    Our Caesar's vesture wounded?
Look you here,


    Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
FIRST CITIZEN.
O piteous spectacle!
SECOND CITIZEN.
O noble Caesar!
THIRD CITIZEN.
O woeful day!
FOURTH CITIZEN.
O traitors villains!
FIRST CITIZEN.
O most bloody sight!
SECOND CITIZEN.
We will be revenged.
ALL.
Revenge!
About!
Seek!
Burn!
Fire!
Kill!
Slay!
Let not a traitor live!
ANTONY.
Stay, countrymen.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Peace there!
Hear the noble Antony.
SECOND CITIZEN.
We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with


    him.
ANTONY.
Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up


    To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honorable.
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,


    That made them do it.
They are wise and honorable,


    And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.
I am no orator, as Brutus is;


    But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,


    That love my friend, and that they know full well


    That gave me public leave to speak of him.
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,


    Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,


    To stir men's blood.
I only speak right on;


    I tell you that which you yourselves do know;


    Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor dumb mouths,


    And bid them speak for me.
But were I Brutus,


    And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony


    Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue


    In every wound of Caesar that should move


    The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
ALL.
We'll mutiny.
FIRST CITIZEN.
We'll burn the house of Brutus.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Away, then!
Come, seek the conspirators.
ANTONY.
Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
ALL.
Peace, ho!
Hear Antony, most noble Antony!
ANTONY.
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
Alas, you know not; I must tell you then.
You have forgot the will I told you of.
ALL.
Most true, the will!
Let's stay and hear the will.
ANTONY.
Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
To every Roman citizen he gives,


    To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Most noble Caesar!
We'll revenge his death.
THIRD CITIZEN.
O royal Caesar!
ANTONY.
Hear me with patience.
ALL.
Peace, ho!
ANTONY.
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,


    His private arbors, and new-planted orchards,


    On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,


    And to your heirs forever- common pleasures,


    To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.
Here was a Caesar!
When comes such another?
FIRST CITIZEN.
Never, never.
Come, away, away!
We'll burn his body in the holy place


    And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
Take up the body.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Go fetch fire.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Pluck down benches.
FOURTH CITIZEN.
Pluck down forms, windows, anything.
Exeunt Citizens with the body.
ANTONY.
Now let it work.
Mischief, thou art afoot,


    Take thou what course thou wilt.
Enter a Servant.
How now, fellow?
SERVANT.
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
ANTONY.
Where is he?
SERVANT.
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
ANTONY.
And thither will I straight to visit him.
He comes upon a wish.
Fortune is merry,


    And in this mood will give us anything.
SERVANT.
I heard him say Brutus and Cassius


    Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
ANTONY.
Be like they had some notice of the people,


    How I had moved them.
Bring me to Octavius.
Exeunt.
Enter Cinna the poet.
CINNA.
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,


    And things unluckily charge my fantasy.
I have no will to wander forth of doors,


    Yet something leads me forth.
Enter Citizens.
FIRST CITIZEN.
What is your name?
SECOND CITIZEN.
Whither are you going?
THIRD CITIZEN.
Where do you dwell?
FOURTH CITIZEN.
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
SECOND CITIZEN.
Answer every man directly.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Ay, and briefly.
FOURTH CITIZEN.
Ay, and wisely.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Ay, and truly, you were best.
CINNA.
What is my name?
Whither am I going?
Where do I dwell?
Am I


    a married man or a bachelor?
Then, to answer every man directly


    and briefly, wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
SECOND CITIZEN.
That's as much as to say they are fools that marry.
You'll bear me a bang for that, I fear.
Proceed directly.
CINNA.
Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
FIRST CITIZEN.
As a friend or an enemy?
CINNA.
As a friend.
SECOND CITIZEN.
That matter is answered directly.
FOURTH CITIZEN.
For your dwelling, briefly.
CINNA.
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Your name, sir, truly.
CINNA.
Truly, my name is Cinna.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Tear him to pieces, he's a conspirator.
CINNA.
I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
FOURTH CITIZEN.
Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad


    verses.
CINNA.
I am not Cinna the conspirator.
FOURTH CITIZEN.
It is no matter, his name's Cinna.
Pluck but his


    name out of his heart, and turn him going.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Tear him, tear him!
Come, brands, ho, firebrands.
To


    Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all.
Some to Decius' house, and some


    to Casca's, some to Ligarius'.
Away, go!
Exeunt.

  ANTONY.
These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.
OCTAVIUS.
Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?
LEPIDUS.
I do consent-


  OCTAVIUS.
Prick him down, Antony.
LEPIDUS.
Upon condition Publius shall not live,


    Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.
ANTONY.
He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house,


    Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine


    How to cut off some charge in legacies.
LEPIDUS.
What, shall I find you here?
OCTAVIUS.
Or here, or at the Capitol.
Exit Lepidus.
ANTONY.
This is a slight unmeritable man,


    Meet to be sent on errands.
Is it fit,


    The three-fold world divided, he should stand


    One of the three to share it?
OCTAVIUS.
So you thought him,


    And took his voice who should be prick'd to die


    In our black sentence and proscription.
ANTONY.
Octavius, I have seen more days than you,


    And though we lay these honors on this man


    To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,


    He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,


    To groan and sweat under the business,


    Either led or driven, as we point the way;


    And having brought our treasure where we will,


    Then take we down his load and turn him off,


    Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears


    And graze in commons.
OCTAVIUS.
You may do your will,


    But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
ANTONY.
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that


    I do appoint him store of provender.
It is a creature that I teach to fight,


    To wind, to stop, to run directly on,


    His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:


    He must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth;


    A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds


    On objects, arts, and imitations,


    Which, out of use and staled by other men,


    Begin his fashion.
Do not talk of him


    But as a property.
And now, Octavius,


    Listen great things.
Brutus and Cassius


    Are levying powers; we must straight make head;


    Therefore let our alliance be combined,


    Our best friends made, our means stretch'd;


    And let us presently go sit in council,


    How covert matters may be best disclosed,


    And open perils surest answered.
OCTAVIUS.
Let us do so, for we are at the stake,


    And bay'd about with many enemies;


    And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,


    Millions of mischiefs.
Exeunt.
Enter Brutus, Lucilius, Lucius, and Soldiers; Titinius and


Pindarus meet them.
BRUTUS.
Stand, ho!
LUCILIUS.
Give the word, ho, and stand.
BRUTUS.
What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?
LUCILIUS.
He is at hand, and Pindarus is come


    To do you salutation from his master.
BRUTUS.
He greets me well.
Your master, Pindarus,


    In his own change, or by ill officers,


    Hath given me some worthy cause to wish


    Things done undone; but if he be at hand,


    I shall be satisfied.
PINDARUS.
I do not doubt


    But that my noble master will appear


    Such as he is, full of regard and honor.
BRUTUS.
He is not doubted.
A word, Lucilius,


    How he received you.
Let me be resolved.
LUCILIUS.
With courtesy and with respect enough,


    But not with such familiar instances,


    Nor with such free and friendly conference,


    As he hath used of old.
BRUTUS.
Thou hast described


    A hot friend cooling.
Ever note, Lucilius,


    When love begins to sicken and decay


    It useth an enforced ceremony.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;


    But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,


    Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;


    But when they should endure the bloody spur,


    They fall their crests and like deceitful jades


    Sink in the trial.
Comes his army on?
LUCILIUS.
They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd;


    The greater part, the horse in general,


    Are come with Cassius.
Low march within.
BRUTUS.
Hark, he is arrived.
March gently on to meet him.
Enter Cassius and his Powers.
CASSIUS.
Stand, ho!
BRUTUS.
Stand, ho!
Speak the word along.
FIRST SOLDIER.
Stand!
SECOND SOLDIER.
Stand!
THIRD SOLDIER.
Stand!
CASSIUS.
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
BRUTUS.
Judge me, you gods!
Wrong I mine enemies?
And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
CASSIUS.
Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,


    And when you do them-


  BRUTUS.
Cassius, be content,


    Speak your griefs softly, I do know you well.
Before the eyes of both our armies here,


    Which should perceive nothing but love from us,


    Let us not wrangle.
Bid them move away;


    Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,


    And I will give you audience.
CASSIUS.
Pindarus,


    Bid our commanders lead their charges off


    A little from this ground.
BRUTUS.
Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man


    Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.
Exeunt.
Enter Brutus and Cassius.
CASSIUS.
That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:


    You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella


    For taking bribes here of the Sardians,


    Wherein my letters, praying on his side,


    Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
BRUTUS.
You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.
CASSIUS.
In such a time as this it is not meet


    That every nice offense should bear his comment.
BRUTUS.
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself


    Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm,


    To sell and mart your offices for gold


    To undeservers.
CASSIUS.
I an itching palm?
You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,


    Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
BRUTUS.
The name of Cassius honors this corruption,


    And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
CASSIUS.
Chastisement?
BRUTUS.
Remember March, the ides of March remember.
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,


    And not for justice?
What, shall one of us,


    That struck the foremost man of all this world


    But for supporting robbers, shall we now


    Contaminate our fingers with base bribes


    And sell the mighty space of our large honors


    For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,


    Than such a Roman.
CASSIUS.
Brutus, bait not me,


    I'll not endure it.
You forget yourself


    To hedge me in.
I am a soldier, I,


    Older in practice, abler than yourself


    To make conditions.
BRUTUS.
Go to, you are not, Cassius.
CASSIUS.
I am.
BRUTUS.
I say you are not.
CASSIUS.
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;


    Have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.
BRUTUS.
Away, slight man!
CASSIUS.
Is't possible?
BRUTUS.
Hear me, for I will speak.
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
CASSIUS.
O gods, ye gods!
Must I endure all this?
BRUTUS.
All this?
Ay, more.
Fret till your proud heart break.
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,


    And make your bondmen tremble.
Must I bouge?
Must I observe you?
Must I stand and crouch


    Under your testy humor?
By the gods,


    You shall digest the venom of your spleen,


    Though it do split you, for, from this day forth,


    I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,


    When you are waspish.
CASSIUS.
Is it come to this?
BRUTUS.
You say you are a better soldier:


    Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,


    And it shall please me well.
For mine own part,


    I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
CASSIUS.
You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
I said, an elder soldier, not a better.
Did I say "better"?
BRUTUS.
If you did, I care not.
CASSIUS.
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
BRUTUS.
Peace, peace!
You durst not so have tempted him.
CASSIUS.
I durst not?
BRUTUS.
No.
CASSIUS.
What, durst not tempt him?
BRUTUS.
For your life you durst not.
CASSIUS.
Do not presume too much upon my love;


    I may do that I shall be sorry for.
BRUTUS.
You have done that you should be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,


    For I am arm'd so strong in honesty,


    That they pass by me as the idle wind


    Which I respect not.
I did send to you


    For certain sums of gold, which you denied me,


    For I can raise no money by vile means.
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart


    And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring


    From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash


    By any indirection.
I did send


    To you for gold to pay my legions,


    Which you denied me.
Was that done like Cassius?
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous


    To lock such rascal counters from his friends,


    Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,


    Dash him to pieces!
CASSIUS.
I denied you not.
BRUTUS.
You did.
CASSIUS.
I did not.
He was but a fool


    That brought my answer back.
Brutus hath rived my heart.
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,


    But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
BRUTUS.
I do not, till you practise them on me.
CASSIUS.
You love me not.
BRUTUS.
I do not like your faults.
CASSIUS.
A friendly eye could never see such faults.
BRUTUS.
A flatterer's would not, though they do appear


    As huge as high Olympus.
CASSIUS.
Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,


    Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,


    For Cassius is aweary of the world:


    Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;


    Check'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,


    Set in a notebook, learn'd and conn'd by rote,


    To cast into my teeth.
O, I could weep


    My spirit from mine eyes!
There is my dagger,


    And here my naked breast; within, a heart


    Dearer than Pluto's mine, richer than gold.
If that thou best a Roman, take it forth;


    I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar, for I know,


    When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better


    Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
BRUTUS.
Sheathe your dagger.
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;


    Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb,


    That carries anger as the flint bears fire,


    Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark


    And straight is cold again.
CASSIUS.
Hath Cassius lived


    To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,


    When grief and blood ill-temper'd vexeth him?
BRUTUS.
When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
CASSIUS.
Do you confess so much?
Give me your hand.
BRUTUS.
And my heart too.
CASSIUS.
O Brutus!
BRUTUS.
What's the matter?
CASSIUS.
Have not you love enough to bear with me


    When that rash humor which my mother gave me


    Makes me forgetful?
BRUTUS.
Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,


    When you are overearnest with your Brutus,


    He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
POET.
[Within.]
Let me go in to see the generals.
There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet


    They be alone.
LUCILIUS.
[Within.]
You shall not come to them.
POET.
[Within.]
Nothing but death shall stay me.
Enter Poet, followed by Lucilius, Titinius, and Lucius.
CASSIUS.
How now, what's the matter?
POET.
For shame, you generals!
What do you mean?
Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;


    For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
CASSIUS.
Ha, ha!
How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
BRUTUS.
Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
CASSIUS.
Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
BRUTUS.
I'll know his humor when he knows his time.
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
Companion, hence!
CASSIUS.
Away, away, be gone!
Exit Poet.
BRUTUS.
Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders


    Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.
CASSIUS.
And come yourselves and bring Messala with you


    Immediately to us.
Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius.
BRUTUS.
Lucius, a bowl of wine!
Exit Lucius.
CASSIUS.
I did not think you could have been so angry.
BRUTUS.
O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
CASSIUS.
Of your philosophy you make no use,


    If you give place to accidental evils.
BRUTUS.
No man bears sorrow better.
Portia is dead.
CASSIUS.
Ha?
Portia?
BRUTUS.
She is dead.
CASSIUS.
How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?
O insupportable and touching loss!
Upon what sickness?
BRUTUS.
Impatient of my absence,


    And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony


    Have made themselves so strong- for with her death


    That tidings came- with this she fell distract,


    And (her attendants absent) swallow'd fire.
CASSIUS.
And died so?
BRUTUS.
Even so.
CASSIUS.
O ye immortal gods!
Re-enter Lucius, with wine and taper.
BRUTUS.
Speak no more of her.
Give me a bowl of wine.
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.
Drinks.
CASSIUS.
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;


  I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
Drinks.
BRUTUS.
Come in, Titinius!
Exit Lucius.
Re-enter Titinius, with Messala.
Welcome, good Messala.
Now sit we close about this taper here,


    And call in question our necessities.
CASSIUS.
Portia, art thou gone?
BRUTUS.
No more, I pray you.
Messala, I have here received letters


    That young Octavius and Mark Antony


    Come down upon us with a mighty power,


    Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
MESSALA.
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
BRUTUS.
With what addition?
MESSALA.
That by proscription and bills of outlawry


    Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus


    Have put to death an hundred senators.
BRUTUS.
There in our letters do not well agree;


    Mine speak of seventy senators that died


    By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
CASSIUS.
Cicero one!
MESSALA.
Cicero is dead,


    And by that order of proscription.
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
BRUTUS.
No, Messala.
MESSALA.
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
BRUTUS.
Nothing, Messala.
MESSALA.
That, methinks, is strange.
BRUTUS.
Why ask you?
Hear you aught of her in yours?
MESSALA.
No, my lord.
BRUTUS.
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
MESSALA.
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:


    For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
BRUTUS.
Why, farewell, Portia.
We must die, Messala.
With meditating that she must die once


    I have the patience to endure it now.
MESSALA.
Even so great men great losses should endure.
CASSIUS.
I have as much of this in art as you,


    But yet my nature could not bear it so.
BRUTUS.
Well, to our work alive.
What do you think


    Of marching to Philippi presently?
CASSIUS.
I do not think it good.
BRUTUS.
Your reason?
CASSIUS.
This it is:


    'Tis better that the enemy seek us;


    So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,


    Doing himself offense, whilst we lying still


    Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
BRUTUS.
Good reasons must of force give place to better.
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground


    Do stand but in a forced affection,


    For they have grudged us contribution.
The enemy, marching along by them,


    By them shall make a fuller number up,


    Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;


    From which advantage shall we cut him off


    If at Philippi we do face him there,


    These people at our back.
CASSIUS.
Hear me, good brother.
BRUTUS.
Under your pardon.
You must note beside


    That we have tried the utmost of our friends,


    Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:


    The enemy increaseth every day;


    We, at the height, are ready to decline.
There is a tide in the affairs of men


    Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;


    Omitted, all the voyage of their life


    Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat,


    And we must take the current when it serves,


    Or lose our ventures.
CASSIUS.
Then, with your will, go on;


    We'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi.
BRUTUS.
The deep of night is crept upon our talk,


    And nature must obey necessity,


    Which we will niggard with a little rest.
There is no more to say?
CASSIUS.
No more.
Good night.
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.
BRUTUS.
Lucius!
Re-enter Lucius.
My gown.
Exit Lucius.
Farewell, good Messala;


    Good night, Titinius; noble, noble Cassius,


    Good night and good repose.
CASSIUS.
O my dear brother!
This was an ill beginning of the night.
Never come such division 'tween our souls!
Let it not, Brutus.
BRUTUS.
Everything is well.
CASSIUS.
Good night, my lord.
BRUTUS.
Good night, good brother.
TITINIUS.
MESSALA.
Good night, Lord Brutus.
BRUTUS.
Farewell, everyone.
Exeunt all but Brutus.
Re-enter Lucius, with the gown.
Give me the gown.
Where is thy instrument?
LUCIUS.
Here in the tent.
BRUTUS.
What, thou speak'st drowsily?
Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o'erwatch'd.
Call Claudio and some other of my men,


    I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
LUCIUS.
Varro and Claudio!
Enter Varro and Claudio.
VARRO.
Calls my lord?
BRUTUS.
I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;


    It may be I shall raise you by and by


    On business to my brother Cassius.
VARRO.
So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
BRUTUS.
I would not have it so.
Lie down, good sirs.
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
Look Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;


    I put it in the pocket of my gown.
Varro and Claudio lie down.
LUCIUS.
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
BRUTUS.
Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,


    And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
LUCIUS.
Ay, my lord, an't please you.
BRUTUS.
It does, my boy.
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
LUCIUS.
It is my duty, sir.
BRUTUS.
I should not urge thy duty past thy might;


    I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
LUCIUS.
I have slept, my lord, already.
BRUTUS.
It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;


    I will not hold thee long.
If I do live,


    I will be good to thee.
Music, and a song.
This is a sleepy tune.
O murtherous slumber,


    Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy


    That plays thee music?
Gentle knave, good night.
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;


    I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down


    Where I left reading?
Here it is, I think.
Sits down.
Enter the Ghost of Caesar.
How ill this taper burns!
Ha, who comes here?
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes


    That shapes this monstrous apparition.
It comes upon me.
Art thou anything?
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil


    That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
Speak to me what thou art.
GHOST.
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
BRUTUS.
Why comest thou?
GHOST.
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
BRUTUS.
Well, then I shall see thee again?
GHOST.
Ay, at Philippi.
BRUTUS.
Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.
Exit Ghost.
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest.
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
Boy!
Lucius!
Varro!
Claudio!
Sirs, awake!
Claudio!
LUCIUS.
The strings, my lord, are false.
BRUTUS.
He thinks he still is at his instrument.
Lucius, awake!
LUCIUS.
My lord?
BRUTUS.
Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
LUCIUS.
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
BRUTUS.
Yes, that thou didst.
Didst thou see anything?
LUCIUS.
Nothing, my lord.
BRUTUS.
Sleep again, Lucius.
Sirrah Claudio!
[To Varro.]
Fellow thou, awake!
VARRO.
My lord?
CLAUDIO.
My lord?
BRUTUS.
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
VARRO.
CLAUDIO.
Did we, my lord?
BRUTUS.
Ay, saw you anything?
VARRO.
No, my lord, I saw nothing.
CLAUDIO.
Nor I, my lord.
BRUTUS.
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;


    Bid him set on his powers betimes before,


    And we will follow.
VARRO.
CLAUDIO.
It shall be done, my lord.
Exeunt.

Enter Octavius, Antony, and their Army.
OCTAVIUS.
Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
You said the enemy would not come down,


    But keep the hills and upper regions.
It proves not so.
Their battles are at hand;


    They mean to warn us at Philippi here,


    Answering before we do demand of them.
ANTONY.
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know


    Wherefore they do it.
They could be content


    To visit other places, and come down


    With fearful bravery, thinking by this face


    To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;


    But 'tis not so.
Enter a Messenger.
MESSENGER.
Prepare you, generals.
The enemy comes on in gallant show;


    Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,


    And something to be done immediately.
ANTONY.
Octavius, lead your battle softly on,


    Upon the left hand of the even field.
OCTAVIUS.
Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
ANTONY.
Why do you cross me in this exigent?
OCTAVIUS.
I do not cross you, but I will do so.
March.
Drum.
Enter Brutus, Cassius, and their Army;


           Lucilius, Titinius, Messala, and others.
BRUTUS.
They stand, and would have parley.
CASSIUS.
Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
OCTAVIUS.
Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
ANTONY.
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
Make forth, the generals would have some words.
OCTAVIUS.
Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
BRUTUS.
Words before blows.
Is it so, countrymen?
OCTAVIUS.
Not that we love words better, as you do.
BRUTUS.
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
ANTONY.
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,


    Crying "Long live!
Hail, Caesar!"
CASSIUS.
Antony,


    The posture of your blows are yet unknown;


    But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,


    And leave them honeyless.
ANTONY.
Not stingless too.
BRUTUS.
O, yes, and soundless too,


    For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,


    And very wisely threat before you sting.
ANTONY.
Villains!
You did not so when your vile daggers


    Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar.
You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,


    And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;


    Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind


    Strooke Caesar on the neck.
O you flatterers!
CASSIUS.
Flatterers?
Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
This tongue had not offended so today,


    If Cassius might have ruled.
OCTAVIUS.
Come, come, the cause.
If arguing make us sweat,


    The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
Look,


    I draw a sword against conspirators;


    When think you that the sword goes up again?
Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds


    Be well avenged, or till another Caesar


    Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
BRUTUS.
Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,


    Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
OCTAVIUS.
So I hope,


    I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
BRUTUS.
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,


    Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.
CASSIUS.
A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,


    Join'd with a masker and a reveler!
ANTONY.
Old Cassius still!
OCTAVIUS.
Come, Antony, away!
Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.
If you dare fight today, come to the field;


    If not, when you have stomachs.
Exeunt Octavius, Antony, and their Army.
CASSIUS.
Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
BRUTUS.
Ho, Lucilius!
Hark, a word with you.
LUCILIUS.
[Stands forth.]
My lord?
Brutus and Lucilius converse apart.
CASSIUS.
Messala!
MESSALA.
[Stands forth.]
What says my general?
CASSIUS.
Messala,


    This is my birthday, as this very day


    Was Cassius born.
Give me thy hand, Messala.
Be thou my witness that, against my will,


    As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set


    Upon one battle all our liberties.
You know that I held Epicurus strong,


    And his opinion.
Now I change my mind,


    And partly credit things that do presage.
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign


    Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,


    Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands,


    Who to Philippi here consorted us.
This morning are they fled away and gone,


    And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites


    Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,


    As we were sickly prey.
Their shadows seem


    A canopy most fatal, under which


    Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
MESSALA.
Believe not so.
CASSIUS.
I but believe it partly,


    For I am fresh of spirit and resolved


    To meet all perils very constantly.
BRUTUS.
Even so, Lucilius.
CASSIUS.
Now, most noble Brutus,


    The gods today stand friendly that we may,


    Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,


    Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
If we do lose this battle, then is this


    The very last time we shall speak together.
What are you then determined to do?
BRUTUS.
Even by the rule of that philosophy


    By which I did blame Cato for the death


    Which he did give himself- I know not how,


    But I do find it cowardly and vile,


    For fear of what might fall, so to prevent


    The time of life- arming myself with patience


    To stay the providence of some high powers


    That govern us below.
CASSIUS.
Then, if we lose this battle,


    You are contented to be led in triumph


    Thorough the streets of Rome?
BRUTUS.
No, Cassius, no.
Think not, thou noble Roman,


    That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;


    He bears too great a mind.
But this same day


    Must end that work the ides of March begun.
And whether we shall meet again I know not.
Therefore our everlasting farewell take.
Forever, and forever, farewell, Cassius!
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;


    If not, why then this parting was well made.
CASSIUS.
Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;


    If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
BRUTUS.
Why then, lead on.
O, that a man might know


    The end of this day's business ere it come!
But it sufficeth that the day will end,


    And then the end is known.
Come, ho!
Away!
Exeunt.
Alarum.
Enter Brutus and Messala.
BRUTUS.
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills


    Unto the legions on the other side.
Loud alarum.
Let them set on at once, for I perceive


    But cold demeanor in Octavia's wing,


    And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
Ride, ride, Messala.
Let them all come down.
Exeunt.
Alarums.
Enter Cassius and Titinius.
CASSIUS.
O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy.
This ensign here of mine was turning back;


    I slew the coward, and did take it from him.
TITINIUS.
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,


    Who, having some advantage on Octavius,


    Took it too eagerly.
His soldiers fell to spoil,


    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
Enter Pindarus.
PINDARUS.
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;


    Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord;


    Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
CASSIUS.
This hill is far enough.
Look, look, Titinius:


    Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
TITINIUS.
They are, my lord.
CASSIUS.
Titinius, if thou lovest me,


    Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,


    Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops


    And here again, that I may rest assured


    Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
TITINIUS.
I will be here again, even with a thought.
Exit.
CASSIUS.
Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;


    My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,


    And tell me what thou notest about the field.
Pindarus ascends the hill.
This day I breathed first: time is come round,


    And where I did begin, there shall I end;


    My life is run his compass.
Sirrah, what news?
PINDARUS.
[Above.]
O my lord!
CASSIUS.
What news?
PINDARUS.
[Above.]
Titinius is enclosed round about


    With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;


    Yet he spurs on.
Now they are almost on him.
Now, Titinius!
Now some light.
O, he lights too.
He's ta'en [Shout.]
And, hark!
They shout for joy.
CASSIUS.
Come down; behold no more.
O, coward that I am, to live so long,


    To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
Pindarus descends.
Come hither, sirrah.
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,


    And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,


    That whatsoever I did bid thee do,


    Thou shouldst attempt it.
Come now, keep thine oath;


    Now be a freeman, and with this good sword,


    That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;


    And when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,


    Guide thou the sword.
[Pindarus stabs him.]
Caesar, thou art revenged,


    Even with the sword that kill'd thee.
Dies.
PINDARUS.
So, I am free, yet would not so have been,


    Durst I have done my will.
O Cassius!
Far from this country Pindarus shall run,


    Where never Roman shall take note of him.
Exit.
Re-enter Titinius with Messala.
MESSALA.
It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius


    Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,


    As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
TITINIUS.
These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
MESSALA.
Where did you leave him?
TITINIUS.
All disconsolate,


    With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
MESSALA.
Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
TITINIUS.
He lies not like the living.
O my heart!
MESSALA.
Is not that he?
TITINIUS.
No, this was he, Messala,


    But Cassius is no more.
O setting sun,


    As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night,


    So in his red blood Cassius' day is set,


    The sun of Rome is set!
Our day is gone;


    Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
MESSALA.
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
O hateful error, melancholy's child,


    Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men


    The things that are not?
O error, soon conceived,


    Thou never comest unto a happy birth,


    But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!
TITINIUS.
What, Pindarus!
Where art thou, Pindarus?
MESSALA.
Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet


    The noble Brutus, thrusting this report


    Into his ears.
I may say "thrusting" it,


    For piercing steel and darts envenomed


    Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus


    As tidings of this sight.
TITINIUS.
Hie you, Messala,


    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
Exit Messala.
Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
Did I not meet thy friends?
And did not they


    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,


    And bid me give it thee?
Didst thou not hear their shouts?
Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;


    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I


    Will do his bidding.
Brutus, come apace,


    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
Kills himself.
Alarum.
Re-enter Messala, with Brutus, young Cato,


                         and others.
BRUTUS.
Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
MESSALA.
Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
BRUTUS.
Titinius' face is upward.
CATO.
He is slain.
BRUTUS.
O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords


    In our own proper entrails.
Low alarums.
CATO.
Brave Titinius!
Look whe'er he have not crown'd dead Cassius!
BRUTUS.
Are yet two Romans living such as these?
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
It is impossible that ever Rome


    Should breed thy fellow.
Friends, I owe moe tears


    To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
Come therefore, and to Thasos send his body;


    His funerals shall not be in our camp,


    Lest it discomfort us.
Lucilius, come,


    And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
Labio and Flavio, set our battles on.
'Tis three o'clock, and Romans, yet ere night


    We shall try fortune in a second fight.
Exeunt.
Alarum.
Enter, fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then Brutus,
young Cato, Lucilius, and others.
BRUTUS.
Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
CATO.
What bastard doth not?
Who will go with me?
I will proclaim my name about the field.
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend.
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
BRUTUS.
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;


    Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!
Exit.
LUCILIUS.
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius,


    And mayst be honor'd, being Cato's son.
FIRST SOLDIER.
Yield, or thou diest.
LUCILIUS.
Only I yield to die.
[Offers money.]
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight:


    Kill Brutus, and be honor'd in his death.
FIRST SOLDIER.
We must not.
A noble prisoner!
SECOND SOLDIER.
Room, ho!
Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
FIRST SOLDIER.
I'll tell the news.
Here comes the general.
Enter Antony.
Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.
ANTONY.
Where is he?
LUCILIUS.
Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.
I dare assure thee that no enemy


    Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus;


    The gods defend him from so great a shame!
When you do find him, or alive or dead,


    He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
ANTONY.
This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,


    A prize no less in worth.
Keep this man safe,


    Give him all kindness; I had rather have


    Such men my friends than enemies.
Go on,


    And see wheer Brutus be alive or dead,


    And bring us word unto Octavius' tent


    How everything is chanced.
Exeunt.
Enter Brutus, Dardanius, Clitus, Strato, and Volumnius.
BRUTUS.
Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
CLITUS.
Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,


    He came not back.
He is or ta'en or slain.
BRUTUS.
Sit thee down, Clitus.
Slaying is the word:


    It is a deed in fashion.
Hark thee, Clitus.
Whispers.
CLITUS.
What, I, my lord?
No, not for all the world.
BRUTUS.
Peace then, no words.
CLITUS.
I'll rather kill myself.
BRUTUS.
Hark thee, Dardanius.
Whispers.
DARDANIUS.
Shall I do such a deed?
CLITUS.
O Dardanius!
DARDANIUS.
O Clitus!
CLITUS.
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
DARDANIUS.
To kill him, Clitus.
Look, he meditates.
CLITUS.
Now is that noble vessel full of grief,


    That it runs over even at his eyes.
BRUTUS.
Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
VOLUMNIUS.
What says my lord?
BRUTUS.
Why, this, Volumnius:


    The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me


    Two several times by night; at Sardis once,


    And this last night here in Philippi fields.
I know my hour is come.
VOLUMNIUS.
Not so, my lord.
BRUTUS.
Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;


    Our enemies have beat us to the pit;            Low alarums.
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves


    Than tarry till they push us.
Good Volumnius,


    Thou know'st that we two went to school together;


    Even for that our love of old, I prithee,


    Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.
VOLUMNIUS.
That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
Alarum still.
CLITUS.
Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
BRUTUS.
Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;


    Farewell to thee too, Strato.
Countrymen,


    My heart doth joy that yet in all my life


    I found no man but he was true to me.
I shall have glory by this losing day,


    More than Octavius and Mark Antony


    By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
So, fare you well at once, for Brutus' tongue


    Hath almost ended his life's history.
Night hangs upon mine eyes, my bones would rest


    That have but labor'd to attain this hour.
Alarum.
Cry within, "Fly, fly, fly!"
CLITUS.
Fly, my lord, fly.
BRUTUS.
Hence!
I will follow.
Exeunt Clitus, Dardanius, and Volumnius.
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.
Thou art a fellow of a good respect;


    Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.
Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,


    While I do run upon it.
Wilt thou, Strato?
STRATO.
Give me your hand first.
Fare you well, my lord.
BRUTUS.
Farewell, good Strato.
Runs on his sword.
Caesar, now be still;


    I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.
Dies.
Alarum.
Retreat.
Enter Octavius, Antony, Messala,


                 Lucilius, and the Army.
OCTAVIUS.
What man is that?
MESSALA.
My master's man.
Strato, where is thy master?
STRATO.
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:


    The conquerors can but make a fire of him;


    For Brutus only overcame himself,


    And no man else hath honor by his death.
LUCILIUS.
So Brutus should be found.
I thank thee, Brutus,


    That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.
OCTAVIUS.
All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
STRATO.
Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
OCTAVIUS.
Do so, good Messala.
MESSALA.
How died my master, Strato?
STRATO.
I held the sword, and he did run on it.
MESSALA.
Octavius, then take him to follow thee


    That did the latest service to my master.
ANTONY.
This was the noblest Roman of them all.

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.
The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.
This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.
If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.
[10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]

Enter Roderigo and Iago.
RODERIGO.
Tush, never tell me!
I take it much unkindly


    That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse


    As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
IAGO.
'Sblood, but you will not hear me.
If ever I did dream of such a matter,


    Abhor me.
RODERIGO.
Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
IAGO.
Despise me, if I do not.
Three great ones of the city,


    In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,


    Off—capp'd to him; and, by the faith of man,


    I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.
But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,


    Evades them, with a bumbast circumstance


    Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war,


    And, in conclusion,


    Nonsuits my mediators; for, "Certes," says he,


    "I have already chose my officer."
And what was he?
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,


    One Michael Cassio, a Florentine


    (A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife)


    That never set a squadron in the field,


    Nor the division of a battle knows


    More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,


    Wherein the toged consuls can propose


    As masterly as he.
Mere prattle without practice


    Is all his soldiership.
But he, sir, had the election;


    And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof


    At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds


    Christian and heathen, must be belee'd and calm'd


    By debitor and creditor.
This counter—caster,


    He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,


    And I—God bless the mark!—his Moorship's ancient.
RODERIGO.
By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
IAGO.
Why, there's no remedy.
'Tis the curse of service,


    Preferment goes by letter and affection,


    And not by old gradation, where each second


    Stood heir to the first.
Now, sir, be judge yourself


    Whether I in any just term am affined


    To love the Moor.
RODERIGO.
I would not follow him then.
IAGO.
O, sir, content you.
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:


    We cannot all be masters, nor all masters


    Cannot be truly follow'd.
You shall mark


    Many a duteous and knee—crooking knave,


    That doting on his own obsequious bondage


    Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,


    For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd.
Whip me such honest knaves.
Others there are


    Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,


    Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,


    And throwing but shows of service on their lords


    Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats


    Do themselves homage.
These fellows have some soul,


    And such a one do I profess myself.
For, sir,


    It is as sure as you are Roderigo,


    Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.
In following him, I follow but myself;


    Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,


    But seeming so, for my peculiar end.
For when my outward action doth demonstrate


    The native act and figure of my heart


    In complement extern, 'tis not long after


    But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve


    For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.
RODERIGO.
What a full fortune does the thick—lips owe,


    If he can carry't thus!
IAGO.
Call up her father,


    Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,


    Proclaim him in the streets, incense her kinsmen,


    And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,


    Plague him with flies.
Though that his joy be joy,


    Yet throw such changes of vexation on't


    As it may lose some color.
RODERIGO.
Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
IAGO.
Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell


    As when, by night and negligence, the fire


    Is spied in populous cities.
RODERIGO.
What, ho, Brabantio!
Signior Brabantio, ho!
IAGO.
Awake!
What, ho, Brabantio!
Thieves!
Thieves!
Thieves!
Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!
Thieves!
Thieves!
Brabantio appears above, at a window.
BRABANTIO.
What is the reason of this terrible summons?
What is the matter there?
RODERIGO.
Signior, is all your family within?
IAGO.
Are your doors lock'd?
BRABANTIO.
Why?
Wherefore ask you this?
IAGO.
'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd!
For shame, put on your gown;


    Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;


    Even now, now, very now, an old black ram


    Is tupping your white ewe.
Arise, arise!
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,


    Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.
Arise, I say!
BRABANTIO.
What, have you lost your wits?
RODERIGO.
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
BRABANTIO.
Not I.
What are you?
RODERIGO.
My name is Roderigo.
BRABANTIO.
The worser welcome.
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say


    My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,


    Being full of supper and distempering draughts,


    Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come


    To start my quiet.
RODERIGO.
Sir, sir, sir—


  BRABANTIO.
But thou must needs be sure


    My spirit and my place have in them power


    To make this bitter to thee.
RODERIGO.
Patience, good sir.
BRABANTIO.
What tell'st thou me of robbing?
This is Venice;


    My house is not a grange.
RODERIGO.
Most grave Brabantio,


    In simple and pure soul I come to you.
IAGO.
'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve


God,


    if the devil bid you.
Because we come to do you service and


you


    think we are ruffians, you'll have your daughter covered with


a


    Barbary horse; you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll


have


    coursers for cousins, and gennets for germans.
BRABANTIO.
What profane wretch art thou?
IAGO.
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and


the


    Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
BRABANTIO.
Thou are a villain.
IAGO.
You are—a senator.
BRABANTIO.
This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.
RODERIGO.
Sir, I will answer anything.
But, I beseech you,


    If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,


    As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,


    At this odd—even and dull watch o' the night,


    Transported with no worse nor better guard


    But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,


    To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor—


    If this be known to you, and your allowance,


    We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;


    But if you know not this, my manners tell me


    We have your wrong rebuke.
Do not believe


    That, from the sense of all civility,


    I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.
Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,


    I say again, hath made a gross revolt,


    Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes


    In an extravagant and wheeling stranger


    Of here and everywhere.
Straight satisfy yourself:


    If she be in her chamber or your house,


    Let loose on me the justice of the state


    For thus deluding you.
BRABANTIO.
Strike on the tinder, ho!
Give me a taper!
Call up all my people!
This accident is not unlike my dream;


    Belief of it oppresses me already.
Light, I say, light!
Exit


above.
IAGO.
Farewell, for I must leave you.
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,


    To be produced—as, if I stay, I shall—


    Against the Moor; for I do know, the state,


    However this may gall him with some check,


    Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd


    With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,


    Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls,


    Another of his fathom they have none


    To lead their business; in which regard,


    Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,


    Yet for necessity of present life,


    I must show out a flag and sign of love,


    Which is indeed but sign.
That you shall surely find him,


    Lead to the Sagittary the raised search,


    And there will I be with him.
So farewell.
Exit.
Enter, below, Brabantio, in his nightgown, and


                        Servants with torches.
BRABANTIO.
It is too true an evil: gone she is,


    And what's to come of my despised time


    Is nought but bitterness.
Now, Roderigo,


    Where didst thou see her?
O unhappy girl!
With the Moor, say'st thou?
Who would be a father!
How didst thou know 'twas she?
O, she deceives me


    Past thought!
What said she to you?
Get more tapers.
Raise all my kindred.
Are they married, think you?
RODERIGO.
Truly, I think they are.
BRABANTIO.
O heaven!
How got she out?
O treason of the blood!
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds


    By what you see them act.
Is there not charms


    By which the property of youth and maidhood


    May be abused?
Have you not read, Roderigo,


    Of some such thing?
RODERIGO.
Yes, sir, I have indeed.
BRABANTIO.
Call up my brother.
O, would you had had her!
Some one way, some another.
Do you know


    Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
RODERIGO.
I think I can discover him, if you please


    To get good guard and go along with me.
BRABANTIO.
Pray you, lead on.
At every house I'll call;


    I may command at most.
Get weapons, ho!
And raise some special officers of night.
On, good Roderigo, I'll deserve your pains.
Exeunt.
Enter Othello, Iago, and Attendants with torches.
IAGO.
Though in the trade of war I have slain men,


    Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience


    To do no contrived murther.
I lack iniquity


    Sometimes to do me service.
Nine or ten times


    I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.
OTHELLO.
'Tis better as it is.
IAGO.
Nay, but he prated


    And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms


    Against your honor


    That, with the little godliness I have,


    I did full hard forbear him.
But I pray you, sir,


    Are you fast married?
Be assured of this,


    That the magnifico is much beloved,


    And hath in his effect a voice potential


    As double as the Duke's.
He will divorce you,


    Or put upon you what restraint and grievance


    The law, with all his might to enforce it on,


    Will give him cable.
OTHELLO.
Let him do his spite.
My services, which I have done the signiory,


    Shall out—tongue his complaints.
'Tis yet to know—


    Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,


    I shall promulgate—I fetch my life and being


    From men of royal siege, and my demerits


    May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune


    As this that I have reach'd.
For know, Iago,


    But that I love the gentle Desdemona,


    I would not my unhoused free condition


    Put into circumscription and confine


    For the sea's worth.
But, look!
What lights come yond?
IAGO.
Those are the raised father and his friends.
You were best go in.
OTHELLO.
Not I; I must be found.
My parts, my title, and my perfect soul


    Shall manifest me rightly.
Is it they?
IAGO.
By Janus, I think no.
Enter Cassio and certain Officers with torches.
OTHELLO.
The servants of the Duke?
And my lieutenant?
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
What is the news?
CASSIO.
The Duke does greet you, general,


    And he requires your haste—post—haste appearance,


    Even on the instant.
OTHELLO.
What is the matter, think you?
CASSIO.
Something from Cyprus, as I may divine;


    It is a business of some heat.
The galleys


    Have sent a dozen sequent messengers


    This very night at one another's heels;


    And many of the consuls, raised and met,


    Are at the Duke's already.
You have been hotly call'd for,


    When, being not at your lodging to be found,


    The Senate hath sent about three several quests


    To search you out.
OTHELLO.
'Tis well I am found by you.
I will but spend a word here in the house


    And go with you.
Exit.
CASSIO.
Ancient, what makes he here?
IAGO.
Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carack;


    If it prove lawful prize, he's made forever.
CASSIO.
I do not understand.
IAGO.
He's married.
CASSIO.
To who?
Re-enter Othello.
IAGO.
Marry, to—Come, captain, will you go?
OTHELLO.
Have with you.
CASSIO.
Here comes another troop to seek for you.
IAGO.
It is Brabantio.
General, be advised,


    He comes to bad intent.
Enter Brabantio, Roderigo, and Officers with torches


                             and weapons.
OTHELLO.
Holla!
Stand there!
RODERIGO.
Signior, it is the Moor.
BRABANTIO.
Down with him, thief!
They draw on both


sides.
IAGO.
You, Roderigo!
Come, sir, I am for you.
OTHELLO.
Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust


them.
Good signior, you shall more command with years


    Than with your weapons.
BRABANTIO.
O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my


daughter?
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her,


    For I'll refer me to all things of sense,


    If she in chains of magic were not bound,


    Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,


    So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd


    The wealthy, curled darlings of our nation,


    Would ever have, to incur a general mock,


    Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom


    Of such a thing as thou—to fear, not to delight.
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense


    That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms,


    Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals


    That weaken motion.
I'll have't disputed on;


    'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee


    For an abuser of the world, a practicer


    Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
Lay hold upon him.
If he do resist,


    Subdue him at his peril.
OTHELLO.
Hold your hands,


    Both you of my inclining and the rest.
Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it


    Without a prompter.
Where will you that I go


    To answer this your charge?
BRABANTIO.
To prison, till fit time


    Of law and course of direct session


    Call thee to answer.
OTHELLO.
What if I do obey?
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied,


    Whose messengers are here about my side,


    Upon some present business of the state


    To bring me to him?
FIRST OFFICER.
'Tis true, most worthy signior;


    The Duke's in council, and your noble self,


    I am sure, is sent for.
BRABANTIO.
How?
The Duke in council?
In this time of the night?
Bring him away;


    Mine's not an idle cause.
The Duke himself,


    Or any of my brothers of the state,


    Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;


    For if such actions may have passage free,


    Bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
Exeunt.
DUKE.
There is no composition in these news


    That gives them credit.
FIRST SENATOR.
Indeed they are disproportion'd;


    My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
DUKE.
And mine, a hundred and forty.
SECOND SENATOR.
And mine, two hundred.
But though they jump not on a just account—


    As in these cases, where the aim reports,


    'Tis oft with difference—yet do they all confirm


    A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
DUKE.
Nay, it is possible enough to judgement.
I do not so secure me in the error,


    But the main article I do approve


    In fearful sense.
SAILOR.
[Within.]
What, ho!
What, ho!
What, ho!
FIRST OFFICER.
A messenger from the galleys.
Enter Sailor.
DUKE.
Now, what's the business?
SAILOR.
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,


    So was I bid report here to the state


    By Signior Angelo.
DUKE.
How say you by this change?
FIRST SENATOR.
This cannot be,


    By no assay of reason; 'tis a pageant


    To keep us in false gaze.
When we consider


    The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,


    And let ourselves again but understand


    That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,


    So may he with more facile question bear it,


    For that it stands not in such warlike brace,


    But altogether lacks the abilities


    That Rhodes is dress'd in.
If we make thought of this,


    We must not think the Turk is so unskillful


    To leave that latest which concerns him first,


    Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,


    To wake and wage a danger profitless.
DUKE.
Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
FIRST OFFICER.
Here is more news.
Enter a Messenger.
MESSENGER.
The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,


    Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,


    Have there injointed them with an after fleet.
FIRST SENATOR.
Ay, so I thought.
How many, as you guess?
MESSENGER.
Of thirty sail; and now they do re-stem


    Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance


    Their purposes toward Cyprus.
Signior Montano,


    Your trusty and most valiant servitor,


    With his free duty recommends you thus,


    And prays you to believe him.
DUKE.
'Tis certain then for Cyprus.
Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?
FIRST SENATOR.
He's now in Florence.
DUKE.
Write from us to him, post-post-haste dispatch.
FIRST SENATOR.
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
Enter Brabantio, Othello, Iago, Roderigo, and Officers.
DUKE.
Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you


    Against the general enemy Ottoman.
[To Brabantio.]
I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;


    We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.
BRABANTIO.
So did I yours.
Good your Grace, pardon me:


    Neither my place nor aught I heard of business


    Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care


    Take hold on me; for my particular grief


    Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature


    That it engluts and swallows other sorrows,


    And it is still itself.
DUKE.
Why, what's the matter?
BRABANTIO.
My daughter!
O, my daughter!
ALL.
Dead?
BRABANTIO.
Ay, to me.
She is abused, stol'n from me and corrupted


    By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;


    For nature so preposterously to err,


    Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,


    Sans witchcraft could not.
DUKE.
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding


    Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself


    And you of her, the bloody book of law


    You shall yourself read in the bitter letter


    After your own sense, yea, though our proper son


    Stood in your action.
BRABANTIO.
Humbly I thank your Grace.
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,


    Your special mandate for the state affairs


    Hath hither brought.
ALL.
We are very sorry for't.
DUKE.
[To Othello.]
What in your own part can you say to this?
BRABANTIO.
Nothing, but this is so.
OTHELLO.
Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,


    My very noble and approved good masters,


    That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,


    It is most true; true, I have married her;


    The very head and front of my offending


    Hath this extent, no more.
Rude am I in my speech,


    And little blest with the soft phrase of peace;


    For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,


    Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used


    Their dearest action in the tented field,


    And little of this great world can I speak,


    More than pertains to feats of broil and battle;


    And therefore little shall I grace my cause


    In speaking for myself.
Yet, by your gracious patience,


    I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver


    Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms,


    What conjuration, and what mighty magic—


    For such proceeding I am charged withal—


    I won his daughter.
BRABANTIO.
A maiden never bold,


    Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion


    Blush'd at herself; and she—in spite of nature,


    Of years, of country, credit, everything—


    To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
It is judgement maim'd and most imperfect,


    That will confess perfection so could err


    Against all rules of nature, and must be driven


    To find out practices of cunning hell


    Why this should be.
I therefore vouch again


    That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,


    Or with some dram conjured to this effect,


    He wrought upon her.
DUKE.
To vouch this is no proof,


    Without more certain and more overt test


    Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods


    Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
FIRST SENATOR.
But, Othello, speak.
Did you by indirect and forced courses


    Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
Or came it by request, and such fair question


    As soul to soul affordeth?
OTHELLO.
I do beseech you,


    Send for the lady to the Sagittary,


    And let her speak of me before her father.
If you do find me foul in her report,


    The trust, the office I do hold of you,


    Not only take away, but let your sentence


    Even fall upon my life.
DUKE.
Fetch Desdemona hither.
OTHELLO.
Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.
Exeunt Iago and


Attendants.
And till she come, as truly as to heaven


    I do confess the vices of my blood,


    So justly to your grave ears I'll present


    How I did thrive in this fair lady's love


    And she in mine.
DUKE.
Say it, Othello.
OTHELLO.
Her father loved me, oft invited me,


    Still question'd me the story of my life


    From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,


    That I have pass'd.
I ran it through, even from my boyish days


    To the very moment that he bade me tell it:


    Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,


    Of moving accidents by flood and field,


    Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,


    Of being taken by the insolent foe


    And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence


    And portance in my travels' history;


    Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,


    Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,


    It was my hint to speak—such was the process—


    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,


    The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads


    Do grow beneath their shoulders.
This to hear


    Would Desdemona seriously incline;


    But still the house affairs would draw her thence,


    Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,


    She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear


    Devour up my discourse; which I observing,


    Took once a pliant hour, and found good means


    To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart


    That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,


    Whereof by parcels she had something heard,


    But not intentively.
I did consent,


    And often did beguile her of her tears


    When I did speak of some distressful stroke


    That my youth suffer'd.
My story being done,


    She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;


    She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;


    'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd


    That heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me,


    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,


    I should but teach him how to tell my story,


    And that would woo her.
Upon this hint I spake:


    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,


    And I loved her that she did pity them.
This only is the witchcraft I have used.
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
Enter Desdemona, Iago, and Attendants.
DUKE.
I think this tale would win my daughter too.
Good Brabantio,


    Take up this mangled matter at the best:


    Men do their broken weapons rather use


    Than their bare hands.
BRABANTIO.
I pray you, hear her speak.
If she confess that she was half the wooer,


    Destruction on my head, if my bad blame


    Light on the man!
Come hither, gentle mistress.
Do you perceive in all this noble company


    Where most you owe obedience?
DESDEMONA.
My noble father,


    I do perceive here a divided duty.
To you I am bound for life and education;


    My life and education both do learn me


    How to respect you; you are the lord of duty,


    I am hitherto your daughter.
But here's my husband,


    And so much duty as my mother show'd


    To you, preferring you before her father,


    So much I challenge that I may profess


    Due to the Moor, my lord.
BRABANTIO.
God be with you!
I have done.
Please it your Grace, on to the state affairs;


    I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
Come hither, Moor.
I here do give thee that with all my heart


    Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart


    I would keep from thee.
For your sake, jewel,


    I am glad at soul I have no other child;


    For thy escape would teach me tyranny,


    To hang clogs on them.
I have done, my lord.
DUKE.
Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence


    Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers


    Into your favor.
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended


    By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone


    Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
What cannot be preserved when Fortune takes,


    Patience her injury a mockery makes.
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;


    He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
BRABANTIO.
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;


    We lose it not so long as we can smile.
He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears


    But the free comfort which from thence he hears;


    But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow


    That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
These sentences, to sugar or to gall,


    Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.
But words are words; I never yet did hear


    That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.
DUKE.
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.
Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and


    though we have there a substitute of most allowed


sufficiency,


    yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more


safer


    voice on you.
You must therefore be content to slubber the


gloss


    of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous


    expedition.
OTHELLO.
The tyrant custom, most grave senators,


    Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war


    My thrice-driven bed of down.
I do agnize


    A natural and prompt alacrity


    I find in hardness and do undertake


    These present wars against the Ottomites.
Most humbly therefore bending to your state,


    I crave fit disposition for my wife,


    Due reference of place and exhibition,


    With such accommodation and besort


    As levels with her breeding.
DUKE.
If you please,


    Be't at her father's.
BRABANTIO.
I'll not have it so.
OTHELLO.
Nor I.


  DESDEMONA.
Nor I. I would not there reside


    To put my father in impatient thoughts


    By being in his eye.
Most gracious Duke,


    To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear,


    And let me find a charter in your voice


    To assist my simpleness.
DUKE.
What would you, Desdemona?
DESDEMONA.
That I did love the Moor to live with him,


    My downright violence and storm of fortunes


    May trumpet to the world.
My heart's subdued


    Even to the very quality of my lord.
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,


    And to his honors and his valiant parts


    Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,


    A moth of peace, and he go to the war,


    The rites for which I love him are bereft me,


    And I a heavy interim shall support


    By his dear absence.
Let me go with him.
OTHELLO.
Let her have your voices.
Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not


    To please the palate of my appetite,


    Nor to comply with heat—the young affects


    In me defunct—and proper satisfaction;


    But to be free and bounteous to her mind.
And heaven defend your good souls, that you think


    I will your serious and great business scant


    For she is with me.
No, when light-wing'd toys


    Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness


    My speculative and officed instruments,


    That my disports corrupt and taint my business,


    Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,


    And all indign and base adversities


    Make head against my estimation!
DUKE.
Be it as you shall privately determine,


    Either for her stay or going.
The affair cries haste,


    And speed must answer't: you must hence tonight.
DESDEMONA.
Tonight, my lord?
DUKE.
This night.
OTHELLO.
With all my heart.
DUKE.
At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
Othello, leave some officer behind,


    And he shall our commission bring to you,


    With such things else of quality and respect


    As doth import you.
OTHELLO.
So please your Grace, my ancient;


    A man he is of honesty and trust.
To his conveyance I assign my wife,


    With what else needful your good Grace shall think


    To be sent after me.
DUKE.
Let it be so.
Good night to everyone.
[To Brabantio.]
And, noble signior,


    If virtue no delighted beauty lack,


    Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
FIRST SENATOR.
Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
BRABANTIO.
Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see;


    She has deceived her father, and may thee.
Exeunt Duke, Senators, and


Officers.
OTHELLO.
My life upon her faith!
Honest Iago,


    My Desdemona must I leave to thee.
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her,


    And bring them after in the best advantage.
Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour


    Of love, of worldly matters and direction,


    To spend with thee.
We must obey the time.
Exeunt Othello and


Desdemona.
RODERIGO.
Iago!
IAGO.
What say'st thou, noble heart?
RODERIGO.
What will I do, thinkest thou?
IAGO.
Why, go to bed and sleep.
RODERIGO.
I will incontinently drown myself.
IAGO.
If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.
Why, thou silly gentleman!
RODERIGO.
It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and


then


    have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
IAGO.
O villainous!
I have looked upon the world for four times


    seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit


and


    an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself.
Ere I


    would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen,


I


    would change my humanity with a baboon.
RODERIGO.
What should I do?
I confess it is my shame to be so


fond,


    but it is not in my virtue to amend it.
IAGO.
Virtue?
a fig!
'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or


thus.
Our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners;


so


    that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and


weed


    up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it


with


    many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with


    industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this


lies in


    our wills.
If the balance of our lives had not one scale of


    reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness


of


    our natures would conduct us to most preposterous


conclusions.
But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal


stings,


    our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love,


to


    be a sect or scion.
RODERIGO.
It cannot be.
IAGO.
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the


    will.
Come, be a man!
Drown thyself?
Drown cats and blind


    puppies.
I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me


knit to


    thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could


never


    better stead thee than now.
Put money in thy purse; follow


thou


    the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurped beard.
I say, put


    money in thy purse.
It cannot be that Desdemona should long


    continue her love to the Moor—put money in thy purse—nor he


his


    to her.
It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an


    answerable sequestration—put but money in thy purse.
These


Moors


    are changeable in their wills—fill thy purse with money.
The


    food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to


him


    shortly as acerb as the coloquintida.
She must change for


youth;


    when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of


her


    choice.
She must have change, she must; therefore put money


in


    thy purse.
If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more


delicate


    way than drowning.
Make all the money thou canst.
If


sanctimony


    and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle


    Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of


hell,


    thou shalt enjoy her—therefore make money.
A pox of drowning


    thyself!
It is clean out of the way.
Seek thou rather to be


    hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go


without


    her.
RODERIGO.
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the


issue?
IAGO.
Thou art sure of me—go, make money.
I have told thee


often,


    and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor.
My cause


is


    hearted; thine hath no less reason.
Let us be conjunctive in


our


    revenge against him.
If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost


thyself


    a pleasure, me a sport.
There are many events in the womb of


time


    which will be delivered.
Traverse, go, provide thy money.
We


will


    have more of this tomorrow.
Adieu.
RODERIGO.
Where shall we meet i' the morning?
IAGO.
At my lodging.
RODERIGO.
I'll be with thee betimes.
IAGO.
Go to, farewell.
Do you hear, Roderigo?
RODERIGO.
What say you?
IAGO.
No more of drowning, do you hear?
RODERIGO.
I am changed; I'll go sell all my land.
Exit.
IAGO.
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse;


    For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane


    If I would time expend with such a snipe


    But for my sport and profit.
I hate the Moor,


    And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets


    He has done my office.
I know not if't be true,


    But I for mere suspicion in that kind


    Will do as if for surety.
He holds me well,


    The better shall my purpose work on him.
Cassio's a proper man.
Let me see now—


    To get his place, and to plume up my will


    In double knavery—How, how?—Let's see—


    After some time, to abuse Othello's ear


    That he is too familiar with his wife.
He hath a person and a smooth dispose


    To be suspected—framed to make women false.
The Moor is of a free and open nature,


    That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,


    And will as tenderly be led by the nose


    As asses are.
I have't.
It is engender'd.
Hell and night


    Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.
Exit.

Enter Montano and two Gentlemen.
MONTANO.
What from the cape can you discern at sea?
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
Nothing at all.
It is a high-wrought flood;


    I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,


    Descry a sail.
MONTANO.
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;


    A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.
If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,


    What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,


    Can hold the mortise?
What shall we hear of this?
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
A segregation of the Turkish fleet.
For do but stand upon the foaming shore,


    The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;


    The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,


    Seems to cast water on the burning bear,


    And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole.
I never did like molestation view


    On the enchafed flood.
MONTANO.
If that the Turkish fleet


    Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd;


    It is impossible to bear it out.
Enter a third Gentleman.
THIRD GENTLEMAN.
News, lads!
Our wars are done.
The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,


    That their designment halts.
A noble ship of Venice


    Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance


    On most part of their fleet.
MONTANO.
How?
Is this true?
THIRD GENTLEMAN.
The ship is here put in,


    A Veronesa.
Michael Cassio,


    Lieutenant to the warlike Moor, Othello,


    Is come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,


    And is in full commission here for Cyprus.
MONTANO.
I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
THIRD GENTLEMAN.
But this same Cassio, though he speak of


comfort


    Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly


    And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted


    With foul and violent tempest.
MONTANO.
Pray heavens he be,


    For I have served him, and the man commands


    Like a full soldier.
Let's to the seaside, ho!
As well to see the vessel that's come in


    As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,


    Even till we make the main and the aerial blue


    An indistinct regard.
THIRD GENTLEMAN.
Come, let's do so,


    For every minute is expectancy


    Of more arrivance.
Enter Cassio.
CASSIO.
Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,


    That so approve the Moor!
O, let the heavens


    Give him defense against the elements,


    For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.
MONTANO.
Is he well shipp'd?
CASSIO.
His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot


    Of very expert and approved allowance;


    Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,


    Stand in bold cure.
A cry within, "A sail, a sail, a


sail!"
Enter a fourth Gentleman.
What noise?
FOURTH GENTLEMAN.
The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea


    Stand ranks of people, and they cry, "A sail!"
CASSIO.
My hopes do shape him for the governor.
Guns


heard.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
They do discharge their shot of courtesy—


    Our friends at least.
CASSIO.
I pray you, sir, go forth,


    And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
I shall.
Exit.
MONTANO.
But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?
CASSIO.
Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid


    That paragons description and wild fame,


    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,


    And in the essential vesture of creation


    Does tire the ingener.
Re-enter second Gentleman.
How now!
who has put in?
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
CASSIO.
He has had most favorable and happy speed:


    Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,


    The gutter'd rocks, and congregated sands,


    Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,


    As having sense of beauty, do omit


    Their mortal natures, letting go safely by


    The divine Desdemona.
MONTANO.
What is she?
CASSIO.
She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,


    Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,


    Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts


    A se'nnight's speed.
Great Jove, Othello guard,


    And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,


    That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,


    Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,


    Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits,


    And bring all Cyprus comfort.
Enter Desdemona, Emilia Iago, Roderigo, and Attendants.
O, behold,


    The riches of the ship is come on shore!
Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
Hall to thee, lady!
And the grace of heaven,


    Before, behind thee, and on every hand,


    Enwheel thee round!
DESDEMONA.
I thank you, valiant Cassio.
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?
CASSIO.
He is not yet arrived, nor know I aught


    But that he's well and will be shortly here.
DESDEMONA.
O, but I fear—How lost you company?
CASSIO.
The great contention of the sea and skies


    Parted our fellowship—But, hark!
a sail.
A cry within, "A sail, a sail!"
Guns


heard.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
They give their greeting to the citadel;


    This likewise is a friend.
CASSIO.
See for the news.
Exit


Gentleman.
Good ancient, you are welcome.
[To Emilia.]
Welcome,


mistress.
Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,


    That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding


    That gives me this bold show of courtesy.
Kisses


her.
IAGO.
Sir, would she give you so much of her lips


    As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,


    You'ld have enough.
DESDEMONA.
Alas, she has no speech.
IAGO.
In faith, too much;


    I find it still when I have list to sleep.
Marry, before your ladyship I grant,


    She puts her tongue a little in her heart


    And chides with thinking.
EMILIA.
You have little cause to say so.
IAGO.
Come on, come on.
You are pictures out of doors,


    Bells in your parlors, wildcats in your kitchens,


    Saints in your injuries, devils being offended,


    Players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds.
DESDEMONA.
O, fie upon thee, slanderer!
IAGO.
Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:


    You rise to play, and go to bed to work.
EMILIA.
You shall not write my praise.
IAGO.
No, let me not.
DESDEMONA.
What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst


    praise me?
IAGO.
O gentle lady, do not put me to't,


    For I am nothing if not critical.
DESDEMONA.
Come on, assay—There's one gone to the harbor?
IAGO.
Ay, madam.
DESDEMONA.
I am not merry, but I do beguile


    The thing I am by seeming otherwise.
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?
IAGO.
I am about it, but indeed my invention


    Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze;


    It plucks out brains and all.
But my Muse labors,


    And thus she is deliver'd.
If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,


    The one's for use, the other useth it.
DESDEMONA.
Well praised!
How if she be black and witty?
IAGO.
If she be black, and thereto have a wit,


    She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.
DESDEMONA.
Worse and worse.
EMILIA.
How if fair and foolish?
IAGO.
She never yet was foolish that was fair,


    For even her folly help'd her to an heir.
DESDEMONA.
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'


the


    alehouse.
What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul


and


    foolish?
IAGO.
There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,


    But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.
DESDEMONA.
O heavy ignorance!
Thou praisest the worst best.
But


what


    praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one


that


    in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of


very


    malice itself?
IAGO.
She that was ever fair and never proud,


    Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,


    Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,


    Fled from her wish and yet said, "Now I may";


    She that, being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,


    Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly;


    She that in wisdom never was so frail


    To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;


    She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,


    See suitors following and not look behind;


    She was a wight, if ever such wight were—


  DESDEMONA.
To do what?
IAGO.
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
DESDEMONA.
O most lame and impotent conclusion!
Do not learn of


him,


    Emilia, though he be thy husband.
How say you, Cassio?
Is he


not


    a most profane and liberal counselor?
CASSIO.
He speaks home, madam.
You may relish him more in the


    soldier than in the scholar.
IAGO.
[Aside.]
He takes her by the palm; ay, well said,


whisper.
With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as


    Cassio.
Ay, smile upon her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own


    courtship.
You say true; 'tis so, indeed.
If such tricks as


these


    strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you


had


    not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are


    most apt to play the sir in.
Very good.
Well kissed!
an


excellent


    courtesy!
'tis so, indeed.
Yet again your fingers to your


lips?
Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!
[Trumpet


within.]
The Moor!
I know his trumpet.
CASSIO.
'Tis truly so.
DESDEMONA.
Let's meet him and receive him.
CASSIO.
Lo, where he comes!
Enter Othello and Attendants.
OTHELLO.
O my fair warrior!
DESDEMONA.
My dear Othello!
OTHELLO.
It gives me wonder great as my content


    To see you here before me.
O my soul's joy!
If after every tempest come such calms,


    May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas


    Olympus-high, and duck again as low


    As hell's from heaven!
If it were now to die,


    'Twere now to be most happy; for I fear


    My soul hath her content so absolute


    That not another comfort like to this


    Succeeds in unknown fate.
DESDEMONA.
The heavens forbid


    But that our loves and comforts should increase,


    Even as our days do grow!
OTHELLO.
Amen to that, sweet powers!
I cannot speak enough of this content;


    It stops me here; it is too much of joy.
And this, and this, the greatest discords be          Kisses


her.
That e'er our hearts shall make!
IAGO.
[Aside.]
O, you are well tuned now!
But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,


    As honest as I am.
OTHELLO.
Come, let us to the castle.
News, friends: our wars are done, the Turks are drown'd.
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;


    I have found great love amongst them.
O my sweet,


    I prattle out of fashion, and I dote


    In mine own comforts.
I prithee, good Iago,


    Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.
Bring thou the master to the citadel;


    He is a good one, and his worthiness


    Does challenge much respect.
Come, Desdemona,


    Once more well met at Cyprus.
Exeunt all but Iago and


Roderigo.
IAGO.
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor.
Come hither.
If


thou


    be'st valiant—as they say base men being in love have then a


    nobility in their natures more than is native to them—list


me.
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard.
First,


I


    must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.
RODERIGO.
With him?
Why, 'tis not possible.
IAGO.
Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
Mark


me


    with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging


and


    telling her fantastical lies.
And will she love him still for


    prating?
Let not thy discreet heart think it.
Her eye must be


    fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil?
When


    the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should


be,


    again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite,


    loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and


beauties—


    all which the Moor is defective in.
Now, for want of these


    required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find


itself


    abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the


Moor;


    very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some


second


    choice.
Now sir, this granted—as it is a most pregnant and


    unforced position—who stands so eminently in the degree of


this


    fortune as Cassio does?
A knave very voluble; no further


    conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and


humane


    seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden


loose


    affection?
Why, none, why, none—a slipper and subtle knave,


a


    finder out of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and


    counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present


    itself—a devilish knave!
Besides, the knave is handsome,


young,


    and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green


minds


    look after—a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath


found


    him already.
RODERIGO.
I cannot believe that in her; she's full of most


blest


    condition.
IAGO.
Blest fig's-end!
The wine she drinks is made of grapes.
If


    she had been blest, she would never have loved the Moor.
Blest


    pudding!
Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his


hand?
Didst not mark that?
RODERIGO.
Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.
IAGO.
Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to


the


    history of lust and foul thoughts.
They met so near with


their


    lips that their breaths embraced together.
Villainous


thoughts,


    Roderigo!
When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at


hand


    comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate


conclusion.
Pish!
But, sir, be you ruled by me.
I have brought you from


    Venice.
Watch you tonight; for the command, I'll lay't upon


you.
Cassio knows you not.
I'll not be far from you.
Do you find


some


    occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or


    tainting his discipline, or from what other course you


please,


    which the time shall more favorably minister.
RODERIGO.
Well.
IAGO.
Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may


    strike at you.
Provoke him, that he may; for even out of that


    will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification


shall


    come into no true taste again but by the displanting of


Cassio.
So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the


means


    I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most


    profitably removed, without the which there were no


expectation


    of our prosperity.
RODERIGO.
I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.
IAGO.
I warrant thee.
Meet me by and by at the citadel.
I must


    fetch his necessaries ashore.
Farewell.
RODERIGO.
Adieu.
Exit.
IAGO.
That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;


    That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit.
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,


    Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,


    And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona


    A most dear husband.
Now, I do love her too,


    Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure


    I stand accountant for as great a sin,


    But partly led to diet my revenge,


    For that I do suspect the lusty Moor


    Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof


    Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards,


    And nothing can or shall content my soul


    Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife.
Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor


    At least into a jealousy so strong


    That judgement cannot cure.
Which thing to do,


    If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash


    For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,


    I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,


    Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb


    (For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too),


    Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me


    For making him egregiously an ass


    And practicing upon his peace and quiet


    Even to madness.
'Tis here, but yet confused:


    Knavery's plain face is never seen till used.
Exit.
Enter a Herald with a proclamation; people following.
HERALD.
It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant


general,


    that upon certain tidings now arrived, importing the mere


    perdition of the Turkish fleet, every man put himself into


    triumph; some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to


what


    sport and revels his addiction leads him; for besides these


    beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptial.
So


much


    was his pleasure should be proclaimed.
All offices are open,


and


    there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of


five


    till the bell have told eleven.
Heaven bless the isle of


Cyprus


    and our noble general Othello!
Exeunt.
Enter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Attendants.
OTHELLO.
Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.
Let's teach ourselves that honorable stop,


    Not to outsport discretion.
CASSIO.
Iago hath direction what to do;


    But notwithstanding with my personal eye


    Will I look to't.
OTHELLO.
Iago is most honest.
Michael, good night.
Tomorrow with your earliest


    Let me have speech with you.
Come, my dear love,


    The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;


    That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
Good night.
Exeunt Othello, Desdemona, and


Attendants.
Enter Iago.
CASSIO.
Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
IAGO.
Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock.
Our


    general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who


let


    us not therefore blame.
He hath not yet made wanton the night


    with her, and she is sport for Jove.
CASSIO.
She's a most exquisite lady.
IAGO.
And, I'll warrant her, full of game.
CASSIO.
Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.
IAGO.
What an eye she has!
Methinks it sounds a parley to


    provocation.
CASSIO.
An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
IAGO.
And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
CASSIO.
She is indeed perfection.
IAGO.
Well, happiness to their sheets!
Come, lieutenant, I have


a


    stope of wine, and here without are a brace of Cyprus


gallants


    that would fain have a measure to the health of black


Othello.
CASSIO.
Not tonight, good Iago.
I have very poor and unhappy


brains


    for drinking.
I could well wish courtesy would invent some


other


    custom of entertainment.
IAGO.
O, they are our friends!
But one cup; I'll drink for you.
CASSIO.
I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily


    qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes here.
I am


    unfortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness


with


    any more.
IAGO.
What, man!
'Tis a night of revels, the gallants desire


it.
CASSIO.
Where are they?
IAGO.
Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.
CASSIO.
I'll do't, but it dislikes me.
Exit.
IAGO.
If I can fasten but one cup upon him,


    With that which he hath drunk tonight already,


    He'll be as full of quarrel and offense


    As my young mistress' dog.
Now my sick fool Roderigo,


    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,


    To Desdemona hath tonight caroused


    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,


    That hold their honors in a wary distance,


    The very elements of this warlike isle,


    Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,


    And they watch too.
Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,


    Am I to put our Cassio in some action


    That may offend the isle.
But here they come.
If consequence do but approve my dream,


    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
Re-enter Cassio; with him Montano and Gentlemen;


                    Servants following with wine.
CASSIO.
'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.
MONTANO.
Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a


    soldier.
IAGO.
Some wine, ho!
[Sings.]
"And let me the canakin clink, clink;


               And let me the canakin clink.
A soldier's a man;


                 O, man's life's but a span;


               Why then let a soldier drink."
Some wine, boys!
CASSIO.
'Fore God, an excellent song.
IAGO.
I learned it in England, where indeed they are most


potent in


    potting.
Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied


Hollander—


    Drink, ho!—are nothing to your English.
CASSIO.
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
IAGO.
Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he


    sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander


a


    vomit ere the next pottle can be filled.
CASSIO.
To the health of our general!
MONTANO.
I am for it, lieutenant, and I'll do you justice.
IAGO.
O sweet England!
[Sings.]
"King Stephen was and—a worthy peer,


                 His breeches cost him but a crown;


               He held them sixpence all too dear,


                 With that he call'd the tailor lown.
"He was a wight of high renown,


                 And thou art but of low degree.
'Tis pride that pulls the country down;


                 Then take thine auld cloak about thee."
Some wine, ho!
CASSIO.
Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
IAGO.
Will you hear't again?
CASSIO.
No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that


does


    those things.
Well, God's above all, and there be souls must


be


    saved, and there be souls must not be saved.
IAGO.
It's true, good lieutenant.
CASSIO.
For mine own part—no offense to the general, nor any


man


    of quality—I hope to be saved.
IAGO.
And so do I too, lieutenant.
CASSIO.
Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant


is to


    be saved before the ancient.
Let's have no more of this;


let's to


    our affairs.
God forgive us our sins!
Gentlemen, let's look


to


    our business.
Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk: this is my


    ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left.
I am not


    drunk now; I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.
ALL.
Excellent well.
CASSIO.
Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am


    drunk.
Exit.
MONTANO.
To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
IAGO.
You see this fellow that is gone before;


    He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar


    And give direction.
And do but see his vice;


    'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,


    The one as long as the other.
'Tis pity of him.
I fear the trust Othello puts him in


    On some odd time of his infirmity


    Will shake this island.
MONTANO.
But is he often thus?
IAGO.
'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.
He'll watch the horologe a double set,


    If drink rock not his cradle.
MONTANO.
It were well


    The general were put in mind of it.
Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature


    Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio


    And looks not on his evils.
Is not this true?
Enter Roderigo.
IAGO.
[Aside to him.]
How now, Roderigo!
I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.
Exit


Roderigo.
MONTANO.
And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor


    Should hazard such a place as his own second


    With one of an ingraft infirmity.
It were an honest action to say


    So to the Moor.
IAGO.
Not I, for this fair island.
I do love Cassio well, and would do much


    To cure him of this evil—But, hark!
What noise?
A cry within, "Help,


help!"
Re-enter Cassio, driving in Roderigo.
CASSIO.
'Zounds!
You rogue!
You rascal!
MONTANO.
What's the matter, lieutenant?
CASSIO.
A knave teach me my duty!
But I'll beat the knave into


a


    twiggen bottle.
RODERIGO.
Beat me!
CASSIO.
Dost thou prate, rogue?
Strikes


Roderigo.
MONTANO.
Nay, good lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
CASSIO.
Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.
MONTANO.
Come, come, you're drunk.
CASSIO.
Drunk?
They


fight.
IAGO.
[Aside to Roderigo.]
Away, I say; go out and cry a


mutiny.
Exit


Roderigo.
Nay, good lieutenant!
God's will, gentlemen!
Help, ho!—Lieutenant—sir—Montano—sir—


    Help, masters!—Here's a goodly watch indeed!
A bell


rings.
Who's that that rings the bell?—Diablo, ho!
The town will rise.
God's will, lieutenant, hold!
You will be shamed forever.
Re-enter Othello and Attendants.
OTHELLO.
What is the matter here?
MONTANO.
'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
Faints.
OTHELLO.
Hold, for your lives!
IAGO.
Hold, ho!
Lieutenant—sir—Montano—gentlemen—


    Have you forgot all place of sense and duty?
Hold!
the general speaks to you!
Hold, hold, for shame!
OTHELLO.
Why, how now, ho!
from whence ariseth this?
Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that


    Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl.
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage


    Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
Silence that dreadful bell; it frights the isle


    From her propriety.
What is the matter, masters?
Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,


    Speak: who began this?
On thy love, I charge thee.
IAGO.
I do not know.
Friends all but now, even now,


    In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom


    Devesting them for bed; and then, but now


    (As if some planet had unwitted men),


    Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,


    In opposition bloody.
I cannot speak


    Any beginning to this peevish odds;


    And would in action glorious I had lost


    Those legs that brought me to a part of it!
OTHELLO.
How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
CASSIO.
I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.
OTHELLO.
Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;


    The gravity and stillness of your youth


    The world hath noted, and your name is great


    In mouths of wisest censure.
What's the matter,


    That you unlace your reputation thus,


    And spend your rich opinion for the name


    Of a night-brawler?
Give me answer to it.
MONTANO.
Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.
Your officer, Iago, can inform you—


    While I spare speech, which something now offends me—


    Of all that I do know.
Nor know I aught


    By me that's said or done amiss this night,


    Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,


    And to defend ourselves it be a sin


    When violence assails us.
OTHELLO.
Now, by heaven,


    My blood begins my safer guides to rule,


    And passion, having my best judgement collied,


    Assays to lead the way.
If I once stir,


    Or do but lift this arm, the best of you


    Shall sink in my rebuke.
Give me to know


    How this foul rout began, who set it on,


    And he that is approved in this offense,


    Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,


    Shall lose me.
What!
in a town of war,


    Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,


    To manage private and domestic quarrel,


    In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
'Tis monstrous.
Iago, who began't?
MONTANO.
If partially affined, or leagued in office,


    Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,


    Thou art no soldier.
IAGO.
Touch me not so near:


    I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth


    Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio;


    Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth


    Shall nothing wrong him.
Thus it is, general.
Montano and myself being in speech,


    There comes a fellow crying out for help,


    And Cassio following him with determined sword,


    To execute upon him.
Sir, this gentleman


    Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,


    Lest by his clamor—as it so fell out—


    The town might fall in fright.
He, swift of foot,


    Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather


    For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,


    And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight


    I ne'er might say before.
When I came back—


    For this was brief—I found them close together,


    At blow and thrust, even as again they were


    When you yourself did part them.
More of this matter cannot I report.
But men are men; the best sometimes forget.
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,


    As men in rage strike those that wish them best,


    Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received


    From him that fled some strange indignity,


    Which patience could not pass.
OTHELLO.
I know, Iago,


    Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,


    Making it light to Cassio.
Cassio, I love thee,


    But never more be officer of mine.
Re-enter Desdemona, attended.
Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
I'll make thee an example.
DESDEMONA.
What's the matter?
OTHELLO.
All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon.
Lead him off.
Exit Montano,
attended.
Iago, look with care about the town,
    And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.
Come, Desdemona, 'tis the soldiers' life.
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.
Exeunt all but Iago and
Cassio.
IAGO.
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
CASSIO.
Ay, past all surgery.
IAGO.
Marry, heaven forbid!
CASSIO.
Reputation, reputation, reputation!
O, I have lost my
    reputation!
I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what
    remains is bestial.
My reputation, Iago, my reputation!
IAGO.
As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some
bodily
    wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation.
Reputation
    is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit
and
    lost without deserving.
You have lost no reputation at all,
    unless you repute yourself such a loser.
What, man!
there are
    ways to recover the general again.
You are but now cast in
his
    mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice; even so as
one
    would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion.
Sue
    to him again, and he's yours.
CASSIO.
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
good a
    commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an
    officer.
Drunk?
and speak parrot?
and squabble?
swagger?
swear?
and discourse fustian with one's own shadow?
O thou invisible
    spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us
call
    thee devil!
IAGO.
What was he that you followed with your sword?
What had he done to you?
CASSIO.
I know not.
IAGO.
Is't possible?
CASSIO.
I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a
    quarrel, but nothing wherefore.
O God, that men should put an
    enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains!
that we
should,
    with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves
    into beasts!
IAGO.
Why, but you are now well enough.
How came you thus
     recovered?
CASSIO.
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to
the
    devil wrath: one unperfectness shows me another, to make me
    frankly despise myself.
IAGO.
Come, you are too severe a moraler.
As the time, the
place,
    and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily
wish
    this had not befallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for
your
    own good.
CASSIO.
I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I
am a
    drunkard!
Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would
    stop them all.
To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool,
and
    presently a beast!
O strange!
Every inordinate cup is
unblest,
    and the ingredient is a devil.
IAGO.
Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it
be
    well used.
Exclaim no more against it.
And, good lieutenant,
I
    think you think I love you.
CASSIO.
I have well approved it, sir.
I drunk!
IAGO.
You or any man living may be drunk at some time, man.
I'll
    tell you what you shall do.
Our general's wife is now the
    general.
I may say so in this respect, for that he hath
devoted
    and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and
denotement
    of her parts and graces.
Confess yourself freely to her;
    importune her help to put you in your place again.
She is of
so
    free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it
a
    vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested.
This
    broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to
splinter;
    and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of
your
    love shall grow stronger than it was before.
CASSIO.
You advise me well.
IAGO.
I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
CASSIO.
I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
beseech
    the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me.
I am desperate of
my
    fortunes if they check me here.
IAGO.
You are in the right.
Good night, lieutenant, I must to
the
    watch.
CASSIO.
Good night, honest Iago.
Exit.
IAGO.
And what's he then that says I play the villain?
When this advice is free I give and honest,
    Probal to thinking, and indeed the course
    To win the Moor again?
For 'tis most easy
    The inclining Desdemona to subdue
    In any honest suit.
She's framed as fruitful
    As the free elements.
And then for her
    To win the Moor, were't to renounce his baptism,
    All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
    His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
    That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
    Even as her appetite shall play the god
    With his weak function.
How am I then a villain
    To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
    Directly to his good?
Divinity of hell!
When devils will the blackest sins put on,
    They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
    As I do now.
For whiles this honest fool
    Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,
    And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
    I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
    That she repeals him for her body's lust;
    And by how much she strives to do him good,
    She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
    And out of her own goodness make the net
    That shall enmesh them all.
Enter Roderigo.
How now, Roderigo!
RODERIGO.
I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that


    hunts, but one that fills up the cry.
My money is almost


spent; I


    have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled; and I think the


    issue will be, I shall have so much experience for my pains;


and


    so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again


to


    Venice.
IAGO.
How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,


    And wit depends on dilatory time.
Does't not go well?
Cassio hath beaten thee,


    And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio.
Though other things grow fair against the sun,


    Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
Content thyself awhile.
By the mass, 'tis morning;


    Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.
Away, I say.
Thou shalt know more hereafter.
Nay, get thee gone.
[Exit Roderigo.]
Two things are to be


done:


    My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress—


    I'll set her on;


    Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,


    And bring him jump when he may Cassio find


    Soliciting his wife.
Ay, that's the way;


    Dull not device by coldness and delay.
Exit.

Enter Cassio and some Musicians.
CASSIO.
Masters, play here, I will content your pains;


Something


    that's brief; and bid "Good morrow, general."
Music.
Enter Clown.
CLOWN.
Why, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that


    they speak i' the nose thus?
FIRST MUSICIAN.
How, sir, how?
CLOWN.
Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?
FIRST MUSICIAN.
Ay, marry, are they, sir.
CLOWN.
O, thereby hangs a tail.
FIRST MUSICIAN.
Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
CLOWN.
Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I know.
But,


    masters, here's money for you; and the general so likes your


    music, that he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more


    noise with it.
FIRST MUSICIAN.
Well, sir, we will not.
CLOWN.
If you have any music that may not be heard, to't again;


    but, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly


    care.
FIRST MUSICIAN.
We have none such, sir.
CLOWN.
Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away.
Go, vanish into air, away!
Exeunt


Musicians.
CASSIO.
Dost thou hear, my honest friend?
CLOWN.
No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.
CASSIO.
Prithee, keep up thy quillets.
There's a poor piece of


gold


    for thee.
If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife


be


    stirring, tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little


favor


    of speech.
Wilt thou do this?
CLOWN.
She is stirring, sir.
If she will stir hither, I shall


seem


    to notify unto her.
CASSIO.
Do, good my friend.
Exit


Clown.
Enter Iago.
In happy time, Iago.
IAGO.
You have not been abed, then?
CASSIO.
Why, no; the day had broke


    Before we parted.
I have made bold, Iago,


    To send in to your wife.
My suit to her


    Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona


    Procure me some access.
IAGO.
I'll send her to you presently;


    And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor


    Out of the way, that your converse and business


    May be more free.
CASSIO.
I humbly thank you for't.
[Exit Iago.]
I never knew


    A Florentine more kind and honest.
Enter Emilia.
EMILIA.
Good morrow, good lieutenant.
I am sorry


    For your displeasure, but all will sure be well.
The general and his wife are talking of it,


    And she speaks for you stoutly.
The Moor replies


    That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus


    And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom


    He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you


    And needs no other suitor but his likings


    To take the safest occasion by the front


    To bring you in again.
CASSIO.
Yet, I beseech you,


    If you think fit, or that it may be done,


    Give me advantage of some brief discourse


    With Desdemona alone.
EMILIA.
Pray you, come in.
I will bestow you where you shall have time


    To speak your bosom freely.
CASSIO.
I am much bound to you.
Exeunt.
Enter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen.
OTHELLO.
These letters give, Iago, to the pilot,


    And by him do my duties to the Senate.
That done, I will be walking on the works;


    Repair there to me.
IAGO.
Well, my good lord, I'll do't.
OTHELLO.
This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?
GENTLEMEN.
We'll wait upon your lordship.
Exeunt.
Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and Emilia.
DESDEMONA.
Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do


    All my abilities in thy behalf.
EMILIA.
Good madam, do.
I warrant it grieves my husband


    As if the cause were his.
DESDEMONA.
O, that's an honest fellow.
Do not doubt, Cassio,


    But I will have my lord and you again


    As friendly as you were.
CASSIO.
Bounteous madam,


    Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,


    He's never anything but your true servant.
DESDEMONA.
I know't: I thank you.
You do love my lord:


    You have known him long; and be you well assured


    He shall in strangeness stand no farther off


    Than in a politic distance.
CASSIO.
Ay, but, lady,


    That policy may either last so long,


    Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,


    Or breed itself so out of circumstances,


    That I being absent and my place supplied,


    My general will forget my love and service.
DESDEMONA.
Do not doubt that.
Before Emilia here


    I give thee warrant of thy place, assure thee,


    If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it


    To the last article.
My lord shall never rest;


    I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;


    His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;


    I'll intermingle everything he does


    With Cassio's suit.
Therefore be merry, Cassio,


    For thy solicitor shall rather die


    Than give thy cause away.
Enter Othello and Iago, at a distance.
EMILIA.
Madam, here comes my lord.
CASSIO.
Madam, I'll take my leave.
DESDEMONA.
Nay, stay and hear me speak.
CASSIO.
Madam, not now.
I am very ill at ease,


    Unfit for mine own purposes.
DESDEMONA.
Well, do your discretion.
Exit


Cassio.
IAGO.
Ha!
I like not that.
OTHELLO.
What dost thou say?
IAGO.
Nothing, my lord; or if—I know not what.
OTHELLO.
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
IAGO.
Cassio, my lord!
No, sure, I cannot think it,


    That he would steal away so guilty-like,


    Seeing you coming.
OTHELLO.
I do believe 'twas he.
DESDEMONA.
How now, my lord!
I have been talking with a suitor here,


    A man that languishes in your displeasure.
OTHELLO.
Who is't you mean?
DESDEMONA.
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.
Good my lord,


    If I have any grace or power to move you,


    His present reconciliation take;


    For if he be not one that truly loves you,


    That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,


    I have no judgement in an honest face.
I prithee, call him back.
OTHELLO.
Went he hence now?
DESDEMONA.
Ay, sooth; so humbled


    That he hath left part of his grief with me


    To suffer with him.
Good love, call him back.
OTHELLO.
Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.
DESDEMONA.
But shall't be shortly?
OTHELLO.
The sooner, sweet, for you.
DESDEMONA.
Shall't be tonight at supper?
OTHELLO.
No, not tonight.
DESDEMONA.
Tomorrow dinner then?
OTHELLO.
I shall not dine at home;


    I meet the captains at the citadel.
DESDEMONA.
Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,


    On Tuesday noon, or night, on Wednesday morn.
I prithee, name the time, but let it not


    Exceed three days.
In faith, he's penitent;


    And yet his trespass, in our common reason—


    Save that, they say, the wars must make example


    Out of their best—is not almost a fault


    To incur a private check.
When shall he come?
Tell me, Othello.
I wonder in my soul,


    What you would ask me, that I should deny,


    Or stand so mammering on.
What?
Michael Cassio,


    That came awooing with you, and so many a time


    When I have spoke of you dispraisingly


    Hath ta'en your part—to have so much to do


    To bring him in!
Trust me, I could do much—


  OTHELLO.
Prithee, no more.
Let him come when he will;


    I will deny thee nothing.
DESDEMONA.
Why, this is not a boon;


    'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,


    Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,


    Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit


    To your own person.
Nay, when I have a suit


    Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,


    It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,


    And fearful to be granted.
OTHELLO.
I will deny thee nothing,


    Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,


    To leave me but a little to myself.
DESDEMONA.
Shall I deny you?
No.
Farewell, my lord.
OTHELLO.
Farewell, my Desdemona; I'll come to thee straight.
DESDEMONA.
Emilia, come.
Be as your fancies teach you;


    Whate'er you be, I am obedient.
Exeunt Desdemona and


Emilia.
OTHELLO.
Excellent wretch!
Perdition catch my soul,


    But I do love thee!
and when I love thee not,


    Chaos is come again.
IAGO.
My noble lord—


  OTHELLO.
What dost thou say, Iago?
IAGO.
Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,


    Know of your love?
OTHELLO.
He did, from first to last.
Why dost thou ask?
IAGO.
But for a satisfaction of my thought;


    No further harm.
OTHELLO.
Why of thy thought, Iago?
IAGO.
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
OTHELLO.
O, yes, and went between us very oft.
IAGO.
Indeed!
OTHELLO.
Indeed?
ay, indeed.
Discern'st thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?
IAGO.
Honest, my lord?
OTHELLO.
Honest?
Ay, honest.
IAGO.
My lord, for aught I know.
OTHELLO.
What dost thou think?
IAGO.
Think, my lord?
OTHELLO.
Think, my lord?
By heaven, he echoes me,


    As if there were some monster in his thought


    Too hideous to be shown.
Thou dost mean something.
I heard thee say even now, thou like'st not that,


    When Cassio left my wife.
What didst not like?
And when I told thee he was of my counsel


    In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, "Indeed!"
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,


    As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain


    Some horrible conceit.
If thou dost love me,


    Show me thy thought.
IAGO.
My lord, you know I love you.
OTHELLO.
I think thou dost;


    And for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty


    And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,


    Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more;


    For such things in a false disloyal knave


    Are tricks of custom; but in a man that's just


    They're close dilations, working from the heart,


    That passion cannot rule.
IAGO.
For Michael Cassio,


    I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
OTHELLO.
I think so too.
IAGO.
Men should be what they seem;


    Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
OTHELLO.
Certain, men should be what they seem.
IAGO.
Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.
OTHELLO.
Nay, yet there's more in this.
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,


    As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts


    The worst of words.
IAGO.
Good my lord, pardon me;


    Though I am bound to every act of duty,


    I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
Utter my thoughts?
Why, say they are vile and false;


    As where's that palace whereinto foul things


    Sometimes intrude not?
Who has a breast so pure,


    But some uncleanly apprehensions


    Keep leets and law-days, and in session sit


    With meditations lawful?
OTHELLO.
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,


    If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear


    A stranger to thy thoughts.
IAGO.
I do beseech you—


    Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,


    As, I confess, it is my nature's plague


    To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy


    Shapes faults that are not—that your wisdom yet,


    From one that so imperfectly conceits,


    Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble


    Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
It were not for your quiet nor your good,


    Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,


    To let you know my thoughts.
OTHELLO.
What dost thou mean?
IAGO.
Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,


    Is the immediate jewel of their souls.
Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;


    'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;


    But he that filches from me my good name


    Robs me of that which not enriches him


    And makes me poor indeed.
OTHELLO.
By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
IAGO.
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;


    Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.
OTHELLO.
Ha!
IAGO.
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock


    The meat it feeds on.
That cuckold lives in bliss


    Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;


    But O, what damned minutes tells he o'er


    Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!
OTHELLO.
O misery!
IAGO.
Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;


    But riches fineless is as poor as winter


    To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend


    From jealousy!
OTHELLO.
Why, why is this?
Think'st thou I'ld make a life of jealousy,


    To follow still the changes of the moon


    With fresh suspicions?
No!
To be once in doubt


    Is once to be resolved.
Exchange me for a goat


    When I shall turn the business of my soul


    To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,


    Matching thy inference.
'Tis not to make me jealous


    To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,


    Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;


    Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw


    The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;


    For she had eyes and chose me.
No, Iago,


    I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;


    And on the proof, there is no more but this—


    Away at once with love or jealousy!
IAGO.
I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason


    To show the love and duty that I bear you


    With franker spirit.
Therefore, as I am bound,


    Receive it from me.
I speak not yet of proof.
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;


    Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure.
I would not have your free and noble nature


    Out of self-bounty be abused.
Look to't.
I know our country disposition well;


    In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks


    They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience


    Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.
OTHELLO.
Dost thou say so?
IAGO.
She did deceive her father, marrying you;


    And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,


    She loved them most.
OTHELLO.
And so she did.
IAGO.
Why, go to then.
She that so young could give out such a seeming,


    To seal her father's eyes up close as oak—


    He thought 'twas witchcraft—but I am much to blame;


    I humbly do beseech you of your pardon


    For too much loving you.
OTHELLO.
I am bound to thee forever.
IAGO.
I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
OTHELLO.
Not a jot, not a jot.
IAGO.
I'faith, I fear it has.
I hope you will consider what is spoke


    Comes from my love.
But I do see you're moved;


    I am to pray you not to strain my speech


    To grosser issues nor to larger reach


    Than to suspicion.
OTHELLO.
I will not.
IAGO.
Should you do so, my lord,


    My speech should fall into such vile success


    Which my thoughts aim not at.
Cassio's my worthy friend—


    My lord, I see you're moved.
OTHELLO.
No, not much moved.
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.
IAGO.
Long live she so!
and long live you to think so!
OTHELLO.
And yet, how nature erring from itself—


  IAGO.
Ay, there's the point, as—to be bold with you—


    Not to affect many proposed matches


    Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,


    Whereto we see in all things nature tends—


    Foh, one may smell in such a will most rank,


    Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.
But pardon me.
I do not in position


    Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear,


    Her will, recoiling to her better judgement,


    May fall to match you with her country forms,


    And happily repent.
OTHELLO.
Farewell, farewell.
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;


    Set on thy wife to observe.
Leave me, Iago.
IAGO.
[Going.]
My lord, I take my leave.
OTHELLO.
Why did I marry?
This honest creature doubtless


    Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
IAGO.
[Returning.]
My lord, I would I might entreat your honor


    To scan this thing no further; leave it to time.
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,


    For sure he fills it up with great ability,


    Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,


    You shall by that perceive him and his means.
Note if your lady strain his entertainment


    With any strong or vehement importunity;


    Much will be seen in that.
In the meantime,


    Let me be thought too busy in my fears—


    As worthy cause I have to fear I am—


    And hold her free, I do beseech your honor.
OTHELLO.
Fear not my government.
IAGO.
I once more take my leave.
Exit.
OTHELLO.
This fellow's of exceeding honesty,


    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,


    Of human dealings.
If I do prove her haggard,


    Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,


    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind


    To prey at fortune.
Haply, for I am black


    And have not those soft parts of conversation


    That chamberers have, or for I am declined


    Into the vale of years—yet that's not much—


    She's gone.
I am abused, and my relief


    Must be to loathe her.
O curse of marriage,


    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,


    And not their appetites!
I had rather be a toad,


    And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,


    Than keep a corner in the thing I love


    For others' uses.
Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:


    Prerogatived are they less than the base;


    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
Even then this forked plague is fated to us


    When we do quicken.
Desdemona comes:


                    Re-enter Desdemona and Emilia.
If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!
I'll not believe't.
DESDEMONA.
How now, my dear Othello!
Your dinner, and the generous islanders


    By you invited, do attend your presence.
OTHELLO.
I am to blame.
DESDEMONA.
Why do you speak so faintly?
Are you not well?
OTHELLO.
I have a pain upon my forehead here.
DESDEMONA.
Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour


    It will be well.
OTHELLO.
Your napkin is too little;


            He puts the handkerchief from him, and she drops it.
Let it alone.
Come, I'll go in with you.
DESDEMONA.
I am very sorry that you are not well.
Exeunt Othello and


Desdemona.
EMILIA.
I am glad I have found this napkin;


    This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
My wayward husband hath a hundred times


    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,


    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,


    That she reserves it evermore about her


    To kiss and talk to.
I'll have the work ta'en out,


    And give't Iago.
What he will do with it


    Heaven knows, not I;


    I nothing but to please his fantasy.
Re-enter Iago.
IAGO.
How now, what do you here alone?
EMILIA.
Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
IAGO.
A thing for me?
It is a common thing—


  EMILIA.
Ha!
IAGO.
To have a foolish wife.
EMILIA.
O, is that all?
What will you give me now


    For that same handkerchief?
IAGO.
What handkerchief?
EMILIA.
What handkerchief?
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,


    That which so often you did bid me steal.
IAGO.
Hast stol'n it from her?
EMILIA.
No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,


    And, to the advantage, I being here took't up.
Look, here it is.
IAGO.
A good wench; give it me.
EMILIA.
What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest


    To have me filch it?
IAGO.
[Snatching it.]
Why, what is that to you?
EMILIA.
If't be not for some purpose of import,


    Give't me again.
Poor lady, she'll run mad


    When she shall lack it.
IAGO.
Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
Go, leave me.
Exit


Emilia.
I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,


    And let him find it.
Trifles light as air


    Are to the jealous confirmations strong


    As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
The Moor already changes with my poison:


    Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,


    Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,


    But with a little act upon the blood


    Burn like the mines of sulphur.
I did say so.
Look, where he comes!
Re-enter Othello.
Not poppy, nor mandragora,


    Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,


    Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep


    Which thou owedst yesterday.
OTHELLO.
Ha, ha, false to me?
IAGO.
Why, how now, general!
No more of that.
OTHELLO.
Avaunt!
be gone!
Thou hast set me on the rack.
I swear 'tis better to be much abused


    Than but to know't a little.
IAGO.
How now, my lord?
OTHELLO.
What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me;


    I slept the next night well, was free and merry;


    I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips.
He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,


    Let him not know't and he's not robb'd at all.
IAGO.
I am sorry to hear this.
OTHELLO.
I had been happy if the general camp,


    Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,


    So I had nothing known.
O, now forever


    Farewell the tranquil mind!
Farewell content!
Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars


    That make ambition virtue!
O, farewell,


    Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,


    The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,


    The royal banner, and all quality,


    Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!
And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats


    The immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit,


    Farewell!
Othello's occupation's gone!
IAGO.
Is't possible, my lord?
OTHELLO.
Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;


    Be sure of it.
Give me the ocular proof;


    Or, by the worth of man's eternal soul,


    Thou hadst been better have been born a dog


    Than answer my waked wrath!
IAGO.
Is't come to this?
OTHELLO.
Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,


    That the probation bear no hinge nor loop


    To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!
IAGO.
My noble lord—


  OTHELLO.
If thou dost slander her and torture me,


    Never pray more; abandon all remorse;


    On horror's head horrors accumulate;


    Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;


    For nothing canst thou to damnation add


    Greater than that.
IAGO.
O grace!
O heaven defend me!
Are you a man?
have you a soul or sense?
God be wi' you; take mine office.
O wretched fool,


    That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
O monstrous world!
Take note, take note, O world,


    To be direct and honest is not safe.
I thank you for this profit, and from hence


    I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense.
OTHELLO.
Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
IAGO.
I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,


    And loses that it works for.
OTHELLO.
By the world,


    I think my wife be honest, and think she is not;


    I think that thou art just, and think thou art not.
I'll have some proof.
Her name, that was as fresh


    As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black


    As mine own face.
If there be cords or knives,


    Poison or fire, or suffocating streams,


    I'll not endure it.
Would I were satisfied!
IAGO.
I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;


    I do repent me that I put it to you.
You would be satisfied?
OTHELLO.
Would?
Nay, I will.
IAGO.
And may.
But, how?
how satisfied, my lord?
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on?
Behold her topp'd?
OTHELLO.
Death and damnation!
O!
IAGO.
It were a tedious difficulty, I think,


    To bring them to that prospect.
Damn them then,


    If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster


    More than their own!
What then?
how then?
What shall I say?
Where's satisfaction?
It is impossible you should see this


    Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,


    As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross


    As ignorance made drunk.
But yet, I say,


    If imputation and strong circumstances,


    Which lead directly to the door of truth,


    Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.
OTHELLO.
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
IAGO.
I do not like the office;


    But sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,


    Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,


    I will go on.
I lay with Cassio lately


    And, being troubled with a raging tooth,


    I could not sleep.
There are a kind of men so loose of soul,


    That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs;


    One of this kind is Cassio.
In sleep I heard him say, "Sweet Desdemona,


    Let us be wary, let us hide our loves";


    And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,


    Cry, "O sweet creature!"
and then kiss me hard,


    As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots,


    That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg


    Over my thigh, and sigh'd and kiss'd; and then


    Cried, "Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!"
OTHELLO.
O monstrous!
monstrous!
IAGO.
Nay, this was but his dream.
OTHELLO.
But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
IAGO.
And this may help to thicken other proofs


    That do demonstrate thinly.
OTHELLO.
I'll tear her all to pieces.
IAGO.
Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;


    She may be honest yet.
Tell me but this;


    Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief


    Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
OTHELLO.
I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
IAGO.
I know not that; but such a handkerchief—


    I am sure it was your wife's—did I today


    See Cassio wipe his beard with.
OTHELLO.
If it be that—


  IAGO.
If it be that, or any that was hers,


    It speaks against her with the other proofs.
OTHELLO.
O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
Now do I see 'tis true.
Look here, Iago,


    All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
'Tis gone.
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell!
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne


    To tyrannous hate!
Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,


    For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
IAGO.
Yet be content.
OTHELLO.
O, blood, blood, blood!
IAGO.
Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
OTHELLO.
Never, Iago.
Like to the Pontic Sea,


    Whose icy current and compulsive course


    Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on


    To the Propontic and the Hellespont,


    Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,


    Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,


    Till that a capable and wide revenge


    Swallow them up.
Now, by yond marble heaven,


    In the due reverence of a sacred vow


Kneels.
I here engage my words.
IAGO.
Do not rise yet.
Kneels.
Witness, you ever-burning lights above,


    You elements that clip us round about,


    Witness that here Iago doth give up


    The execution of his wit, hands, heart,


    To wrong'd Othello's service!
Let him command,


    And to obey shall be in me remorse,


    What bloody business ever.
They


rise.
OTHELLO.
I greet thy love,


    Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,


    And will upon the instant put thee to't:


    Within these three days let me hear thee say


    That Cassio's not alive.
IAGO.
My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request;


    But let her live.
OTHELLO.
Damn her, lewd minx!
O, damn her!
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,


    To furnish me with some swift means of death


    For the fair devil.
Now art thou my lieutenant.
IAGO.
I am your own forever.
Exeunt.
Enter Desdemona, Emilia, and Clown.
DESDEMONA.
Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
CLOWN.
I dare not say he lies anywhere.
DESDEMONA.
Why, man?
CLOWN.
He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is


    stabbing.
DESDEMONA.
Go to!
Where lodges he?
CLOWN.
To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
DESDEMONA.
Can anything be made of this?
CLOWN.
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a


lodging,


    and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine


own


    throat.
DESDEMONA.
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
CLOWN.
I will catechize the world for him; that is, make


questions


    and by them answer.
DESDEMONA.
Seek him, bid him come hither.
Tell him I have moved


my


    lord on his behalf and hope all will be well.
CLOWN.
To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and


therefore


    I will attempt the doing it.
Exit.
DESDEMONA.
Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
EMILIA.
I know not, madam.
DESDEMONA.
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse


    Full of crusadoes; and, but my noble Moor


    Is true of mind and made of no such baseness


    As jealous creatures are, it were enough


    To put him to ill thinking.
EMILIA.
Is he not jealous?
DESDEMONA.
Who, he?
I think the sun where he was born


    Drew all such humors from him.
EMILIA.
Look, where he comes.
DESDEMONA.
I will not leave him now till Cassio


    Be call'd to him.
Enter Othello.
How is't with you, my lord?
OTHELLO.
Well, my good lady.
[Aside.]
O, hardness to dissemble!
How do you, Desdemona?
DESDEMONA.
Well, my good lord.
OTHELLO.
Give me your hand.
This hand is moist, my lady.
DESDEMONA.
It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
OTHELLO.
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;


    Hot, hot, and moist.
This hand of yours requires


    A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,


    Much castigation, exercise devout,


    For here's a young and sweating devil here


    That commonly rebels.
'Tis a good hand,


    A frank one.
DESDEMONA.
You may, indeed, say so;


    For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
OTHELLO.
A liberal hand.
The hearts of old gave hands;


    But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
DESDEMONA.
I cannot speak of this.
Come now, your promise.
OTHELLO.
What promise, chuck?
DESDEMONA.
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
OTHELLO.
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;


    Lend me thy handkerchief.
DESDEMONA.
Here, my lord.
OTHELLO.
That which I gave you.
DESDEMONA.
I have it not about me.
OTHELLO.
Not?
DESDEMONA.
No, faith, my lord.
OTHELLO.
That's a fault.
That handkerchief


    Did an Egyptian to my mother give;


    She was a charmer, and could almost read


    The thoughts of people.
She told her, while she kept it,


    'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father


    Entirely to her love, but if she lost it


    Or made a gift of it, my father's eye


    Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt


    After new fancies.
She dying gave it me,


    And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,


    To give it her.
I did so, and take heed on't;


    Make it a darling like your precious eye;


    To lose't or give't away were such perdition


    As nothing else could match.
DESDEMONA.
Is't possible?
OTHELLO.
'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it.
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world


    The sun to course two hundred compasses,


    In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;


    The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk,


    And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful


    Conserved of maiden's hearts.
DESDEMONA.
Indeed!
is't true?
OTHELLO.
Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
DESDEMONA.
Then would to God that I had never seen't!
OTHELLO.
Ha!
wherefore?
DESDEMONA.
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
OTHELLO.
Is't lost?
is't gone?
speak, is it out o' the way?
DESDEMONA.
Heaven bless us!
OTHELLO.
Say you?
DESDEMONA.
It is not lost; but what an if it were?
OTHELLO.
How?
DESDEMONA.
I say, it is not lost.
OTHELLO.
Fetch't, let me see it.
DESDEMONA.
Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
This is a trick to put me from my suit.
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.
OTHELLO.
Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.
DESDEMONA.
Come, come,


    You'll never meet a more sufficient man.
OTHELLO.
The handkerchief!
DESDEMONA.
I pray, talk me of Cassio.
OTHELLO.
The handkerchief!
DESDEMONA.
A man that all his time


    Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,


    Shared dangers with you—


  OTHELLO.
The handkerchief!
DESDEMONA.
In sooth, you are to blame.
OTHELLO.
Away!
Exit.
EMILIA.
Is not this man jealous?
DESDEMONA.
I ne'er saw this before.
Sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief;


    I am most unhappy in the loss of it.
EMILIA.
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
They are all but stomachs and we all but food;


    They eat us hungerly, and when they are full


    They belch us.
Look you!
Cassio and my husband.
Enter Cassio and Iago.
IAGO.
There is no other way; 'tis she must do't.
And, lo, the happiness!
Go and importune her.
DESDEMONA.
How now, good Cassio!
What's the news with you?
CASSIO.
Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you


    That by your virtuous means I may again


    Exist and be a member of his love


    Whom I with all the office of my heart


    Entirely honor.
I would not be delay'd.
If my offense be of such mortal kind


    That nor my service past nor present sorrows


    Nor purposed merit in futurity


    Can ransom me into his love again,


    But to know so must be my benefit;


    So shall I clothe me in a forced content


    And shut myself up in some other course


    To Fortune's alms.
DESDEMONA.
Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
My advocation is not now in tune;


    My lord is not my lord, nor should I know him


    Were he in favor as in humor alter'd.
So help me every spirit sanctified,


    As I have spoken for you all my best


    And stood within the blank of his displeasure


    For my free speech!
You must awhile be patient.
What I can do I will; and more I will


    Than for myself I dare.
Let that suffice you.
IAGO.
Is my lord angry?
EMILIA.
He went hence but now,


    And certainly in strange unquietness.
IAGO.
Can he be angry?
I have seen the cannon,


    When it hath blown his ranks into the air


    And, like the devil, from his very arm


    Puff'd his own brother.
And can he be angry?
Something of moment then.
I will go meet him.
There's matter in't indeed if he be angry.
DESDEMONA.
I prithee, do so.
Exit


Iago.
Something sure of state,


    Either from Venice or some unhatch'd practice


    Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,


    Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases


    Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,


    Though great ones are their object.
'Tis even so;


    For let our finger ache, and it indues


    Our other healthful members even to that sense


    Of pain.
Nay, we must think men are not gods,


    Nor of them look for such observancy


    As fits the bridal.
Beshrew me much, Emilia,


    I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,


    Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;


    But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,


    And he's indicted falsely.
EMILIA.
Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,


    And no conception nor no jealous toy


    Concerning you.
DESDEMONA.
Alas the day, I never gave him cause!
EMILIA.
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;


    They are not ever jealous for the cause,


    But jealous for they are jealous.
'Tis a monster


    Begot upon itself, born on itself.
DESDEMONA.
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
EMILIA.
Lady, amen.
DESDEMONA.
I will go seek him.
Cassio, walk hereabout.
If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit,


    And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
CASSIO.
I humbly thank your ladyship.
Exeunt Desdemona and


Emilia.
Enter Bianca.
BIANCA.
Save you, friend Cassio!
CASSIO.
What make you from home?
How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
I'faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
BIANCA.
And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
What, keep a week away?
seven days and nights?
Eight score eight hours?
and lovers' absent hours,


    More tedious than the dial eight score times?
O weary reckoning!
CASSIO.
Pardon me, Bianca.
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd;


    But I shall in a more continuate time


    Strike off this score of absence.
Sweet Bianca,


                                  Gives her Desdemona's


handkerchief.
Take me this work out.
BIANCA.
O Cassio, whence came this?
This is some token from a newer friend.
To the felt absence now I feel a cause.
Is't come to this?
Well, well.
CASSIO.
Go to, woman!
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,


    From whence you have them.
You are jealous now


    That this is from some mistress, some remembrance.
No, by my faith, Bianca.
BIANCA.
Why, whose is it?
CASSIO.
I know not, sweet.
I found it in my chamber.
I like the work well.
Ere it be demanded—


    As like enough it will—I'ld have it copied.
Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.
BIANCA.
Leave you!
wherefore?
CASSIO.
I do attend here on the general;


    And think it no addition, nor my wish,


    To have him see me woman'd.
BIANCA.
Why, I pray you?
CASSIO.
Not that I love you not.
BIANCA.
But that you do not love me.
I pray you, bring me on the way a little,


    And say if I shall see you soon at night.
CASSIO.
'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,


    For I attend here, but I'll see you soon.
BIANCA.
'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.
Exeunt.

Enter Othello and Iago.
IAGO.
Will you think so?
OTHELLO.
Think so, Iago?
IAGO.
What,


    To kiss in private?
OTHELLO.
An unauthorized kiss.
IAGO.
Or to be naked with her friend in bed


    An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
OTHELLO.
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
It is hypocrisy against the devil.
They that mean virtuously and yet do so,


    The devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven.
IAGO.
So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.
But if I give my wife a handkerchief—


  OTHELLO.
What then?
IAGO.
Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers,


    She may, I think, bestow't on any man.
OTHELLO.
She is protectress of her honor too.
May she give that?
IAGO.
Her honor is an essence that's not seen;


    They have it very oft that have it not.
But for the handkerchief—


  OTHELLO.
By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
Thou said'st—O, it comes o'er my memory,


    As doth the raven o'er the infected house,


    Boding to all—he had my handkerchief.
IAGO.
Ay, what of that?
OTHELLO.
That's not so good now.
IAGO.
What,


    If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
Or heard him say—as knaves be such abroad,


    Who having, by their own importunate suit,


    Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,


    Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose


    But they must blab—


  OTHELLO.
Hath he said anything?
IAGO.
He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,


    No more than he'll unswear.
OTHELLO.
What hath he said?
IAGO.
Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.
OTHELLO.
What?
what?
IAGO.
Lie—


  OTHELLO.
With her?
IAGO.
With her, on her, what you will.
OTHELLO.
Lie with her!
lie on her!
We say lie on her, when they


    belie her.
Lie with her!
'Zounds, that's fulsome!
Handkerchief—


    confessions—handkerchief!
To confess and be hanged for his


labor—


    first, to be hanged, and then to confess.
I tremble at it.
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion


without


    some instruction.
It is not words that shakes me thus.
Pish!
Noses, ears, and lips.
Is't possible?
Confess?
Handkerchief?
O


    devil!
Falls in a


trance.
IAGO.
Work on,


    My medicine, work!
Thus credulous fools are caught,


    And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,


    All guiltless, meet reproach.
What, ho!
My lord!
My lord, I say!
Othello!
Enter Cassio.
How now, Cassio!
CASSIO.
What's the matter?
IAGO.
My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy.
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.
CASSIO.
Rub him about the temples.
IAGO.
No, forbear;


    The lethargy must have his quiet course.
If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by


    Breaks out to savage madness.
Look, he stirs.
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,


    He will recover straight.
When he is gone,


    I would on great occasion speak with you.
Exit


Cassio.
How is it, general?
Have you not hurt your head?
OTHELLO.
Dost thou mock me?
IAGO.
I mock you?
No, by heaven.
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
OTHELLO.
A horned man's a monster and a beast.
IAGO.
There's many a beast then in a populous city,


    And many a civil monster.
OTHELLO.
Did he confess it?
IAGO.
Good sir, be a man;


    Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked


    May draw with you.
There's millions now alive


    That nightly lie in those unproper beds


    Which they dare swear peculiar.
Your case is better.
O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,


    To lip a wanton in a secure couch,


    And to suppose her chaste!
No, let me know,


    And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
OTHELLO.
O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.
IAGO.
Stand you awhile


apart,


    Confine yourself but in a patient list.
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief—


    A passion most unsuiting such a man—


    Cassio came hither.
I shifted him away,


    And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy;


    Bade him anon return and here speak with me


    The which he promised.
Do but encave yourself


    And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,


    That dwell in every region of his face;


    For I will make him tell the tale anew,


    Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when


    He hath and is again to cope your wife.
I say, but mark his gesture.
Marry, patience,


    Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,


    And nothing of a man.
OTHELLO.
Dost thou hear, Iago?
I will be found most cunning in my patience;


    But (dost thou hear?)
most bloody.
IAGO.
That's not amiss;


    But yet keep time in all.
Will you withdraw?
Othello


retires.
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,


    A housewife that by selling her desires


    Buys herself bread and clothes.
It is a creature


    That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague


    To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain


    From the excess of laughter.
Here he comes.
Re-enter Cassio.
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;


    And his unbookish jealousy must construe


    Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behavior


    Quite in the wrong.
How do you now, lieutenant?
CASSIO.
The worser that you give me the addition


    Whose want even kills me.
IAGO.
Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
Now, if this suit lay in Bianca's power,


    How quickly should you speed!
CASSIO.
Alas, poor caitiff!
OTHELLO.
Look, how he laughs already!
IAGO.
I never knew a woman love man so.
CASSIO.
Alas, poor rogue!
I think, i'faith, she loves me.
OTHELLO.
Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.
IAGO.
Do you hear, Cassio?
OTHELLO.
Now he importunes him


    To tell it o'er.
Go to; well said, well said.
IAGO.
She gives it out that you shall marry her.
Do you intend it?
CASSIO.
Ha, ha, ha!
OTHELLO.
Do you triumph, Roman?
Do you triumph?
CASSIO.
I marry her!
What?
A customer!
I prithee, bear some


charity


    to my wit; do not think it so unwholesome.
Ha, ha, ha!
OTHELLO.
So, so, so, so.
They laugh that win.
IAGO.
Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
CASSIO.
Prithee, say true.
IAGO.
I am a very villain else.
OTHELLO.
Have you scored me?
Well.
CASSIO.
This is the monkey's own giving out.
She is persuaded I


    will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of


my


    promise.
OTHELLO.
Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
CASSIO.
She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
I


was


    the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians,


and


    thither comes the bauble, and, by this hand, she falls me


thus


    about my neck—


  OTHELLO.
Crying, "O dear Cassio!"
as it were; his gesture


imports


    it.
CASSIO.
So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and


pulls


    me.
Ha, ha, ha!
OTHELLO.
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber.
O, I


see


    that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.
CASSIO.
Well, I must leave her company.
IAGO.
Before me!
look where she comes.
CASSIO.
'Tis such another fitchew!
marry, a perfumed one.
Enter Bianca.
What do you mean by this haunting of me?
BIANCA.
Let the devil and his dam haunt you!
What did you mean


by


    that same handkerchief you gave me even now?
I was a fine


fool to


    take it.
I must take out the work?
A likely piece of work


that


    you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it


    there!
This is some minx's token, and I must take out the


work?
There, give it your hobbyhorse.
Wheresoever you had it, I'll


take


    out no work on't.
CASSIO.
How now, my sweet Bianca!
how now!
how now!
OTHELLO.
By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
BIANCA.
An you'll come to supper tonight, you may; an you will


not,


    come when you are next prepared for.
Exit.
IAGO.
After her, after her.
CASSIO.
Faith, I must; she'll rail i' the street else.
IAGO.
Will you sup there?
CASSIO.
Faith, I intend so.
IAGO.
Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain


speak


    with you.
CASSIO.
Prithee, come; will you?
IAGO.
Go to; say no more.
Exit


Cassio.
OTHELLO.
[Advancing.]
How shall I murther him, Iago?
IAGO.
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
OTHELLO.
O Iago!
IAGO.
And did you see the handkerchief?
OTHELLO.
Was that mine?
IAGO.
Yours, by this hand.
And to see how he prizes the foolish


    woman your wife!
She gave it him, and he hath given it his


whore.
OTHELLO.
I would have him nine years akilling.
A fine woman!
a


fair


    woman!
a sweet woman!
IAGO.
Nay, you must forget that.
OTHELLO.
Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight,


for


    she shall not live.
No, my heart is turned to stone; I strike


it,


    and it hurts my hand.
O, the world hath not a sweeter


creature.
She might lie by an emperor's side, and command him tasks.
IAGO.
Nay, that's not your way.
OTHELLO.
Hang her!
I do but say what she is.
So delicate with


her


    needle, an admirable musician.
O, she will sing the


savageness


    out of a bear.
Of so high and plenteous wit and invention—


  IAGO.
She's the worse for all this.
OTHELLO.
O, a thousand, a thousand times.
And then, of so


gentle a


    condition!
IAGO.
Ay, too gentle.
OTHELLO.
Nay, that's certain.
But yet the pity of it, Iago!
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!
IAGO.
If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to


    offend, for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody.
OTHELLO.
I will chop her into messes.
Cuckold me!
IAGO.
O, 'tis foul in her.
OTHELLO.
With mine officer!
IAGO.
That's fouler.
OTHELLO.
Get me some poison, Iago, this night.
I'll not


expostulate


    with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again.
This


    night, Iago.
IAGO.
Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the


bed


    she hath contaminated.
OTHELLO.
Good, good, the justice of it pleases, very good.
IAGO.
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker.
You shall hear


more


    by midnight.
OTHELLO.
Excellent good.
[A trumpet within.]
What trumpet is


that


    same?
IAGO.
Something from Venice, sure.
'Tis Lodovico


    Come from the Duke.
And, see your wife is with him.
Enter Lodovico, Desdemona, and Attendants.
LODOVICO.
God save the worthy general!
OTHELLO.
With all my heart, sir.
LODOVICO.
The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you.
Gives him a


letter.
OTHELLO.
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
Opens the letter, and


reads.
DESDEMONA.
And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?
IAGO.
I am very glad to see you, signior;


    Welcome to Cyprus.
LODOVICO.
I thank you.
How does Lieutenant Cassio?
IAGO.
Lives, sir.
DESDEMONA.
Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord


    An unkind breach; but you shall make all well.
OTHELLO.
Are you sure of that?
DESDEMONA.
My lord?
OTHELLO.
[Reads.]
"This fail you not to do, as you will—"


  LODOVICO.
He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?
DESDEMONA.
A most unhappy one.
I would do much


    To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.
OTHELLO.
Fire and brimstone!
DESDEMONA.
My lord?
OTHELLO.
Are you wise?
DESDEMONA.
What, is he angry?
LODOVICO.
May be the letter moved him;


    For, as I think, they do command him home,


    Deputing Cassio in his government.
DESDEMONA.
By my troth, I am glad on't.
OTHELLO.
Indeed!
DESDEMONA.
My lord?
OTHELLO.
I am glad to see you mad.
DESDEMONA.
Why, sweet Othello?
OTHELLO.
Devil!
Strikes


her.
DESDEMONA.
I have not deserved this.
LODOVICO.
My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,


    Though I should swear I saw't.
'Tis very much.
Make her amends; she weeps.
OTHELLO.
O devil, devil!
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,


    Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
Out of my sight!
DESDEMONA.
[Going.]
I will not stay to offend you.
LODOVICO.
Truly, an obedient lady.
I do beseech your lordship, call her back.
OTHELLO.
Mistress!
DESDEMONA.
My lord?
OTHELLO.
What would you with her, sir?
LODOVICO.
Who, I, my lord?
OTHELLO.
Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.
Sir, she can turn and turn, and yet go on,


    And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;


    And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,


    Very obedient.
Proceed you in your tears.
Concerning this, sir—O well-painted passion!—


    I am commanded home.
Get you away;


    I'll send for you anon.
Sir, I obey the mandate,


    And will return to Venice.
Hence, avaunt!
Exit


Desdemona.
Cassio shall have my place.
And, sir, tonight,


    I do entreat that we may sup together.
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.
Goats and monkeys!
Exit.
LODOVICO.
Is this the noble Moor whom our full Senate


    Call all in all sufficient?
This the nature


    Whom passion could not shake?
whose solid virtue


    The shot of accident nor dart of chance


    Could neither graze nor pierce?
IAGO.
He is much changed.
LODOVICO.
Are his wits safe?
Is he not light of brain?
IAGO.
He's that he is.
I may not breathe my censure


    What he might be: if what he might he is not,


    I would to heaven he were!
LODOVICO.
What, strike his wife!
IAGO.
Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew


    That stroke would prove the worst!
LODOVICO.
Is it his use?
Or did the letters work upon his blood,


    And new create this fault?
IAGO.
Alas, alas!
It is not honesty in me to speak


    What I have seen and known.
You shall observe him,


    And his own courses will denote him so


    That I may save my speech.
Do but go after,


    And mark how he continues.
LODOVICO.
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.
Exeunt.
Enter Othello and Emilia.
OTHELLO.
You have seen nothing, then?
EMILIA.
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
OTHELLO.
Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
EMILIA.
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard


    Each syllable that breath made up between them.
OTHELLO.
What, did they never whisper?
EMILIA.
Never, my lord.
OTHELLO.
Nor send you out o' the way?
EMILIA.
Never.
OTHELLO.
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
EMILIA.
Never, my lord.
OTHELLO.
That's strange.
EMILIA.
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,


    Lay down my soul at stake.
If you think other,


    Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
If any wretch have put this in your head,


    Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,


    There's no man happy; the purest of their wives


    Is foul as slander.
OTHELLO.
Bid her come hither; go.
Exit


Emilia.
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd


    That cannot say as much.
This is a subtle whore,


    A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.
Enter Desdemona with Emilia.
DESDEMONA.
My lord, what is your will?
OTHELLO.
Pray, chuck, come


hither.
DESDEMONA.
What is your pleasure?
OTHELLO.
Let me see your eyes;


    Look in my face.
DESDEMONA.
What horrible fancy's this?
OTHELLO.
[To Emilia.]
Some of your function, mistress,


    Leave procreants alone and shut the door;


    Cough, or cry "hem," if anybody come.
Your mystery, your mystery; nay, dispatch.
Exit


Emilia.
DESDEMONA.
Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
I understand a fury in your words,


    But not the words.
OTHELLO.
Why, what art thou?
DESDEMONA.
Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.
OTHELLO.
Come, swear it, damn thyself;


    Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves


    Should fear to seize thee.
Therefore be double-damn'd;


    Swear thou art honest.
DESDEMONA.
Heaven doth truly know it.
OTHELLO.
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
DESDEMONA.
To whom, my lord?
with whom?
how am I false?
OTHELLO.
O Desdemona!
Away!
away!
away!
DESDEMONA.
Alas the heavy day!
Why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
If haply you my father do suspect


    An instrument of this your calling back,


    Lay not your blame on me.
If you have lost him,


    Why, I have lost him too.
OTHELLO.
Had it pleased heaven


    To try me with affliction, had they rain'd


    All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head,


    Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,


    Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,


    I should have found in some place of my soul


    A drop of patience; but, alas, to make me


    A fixed figure for the time for scorn


    To point his slow unmoving finger at!
Yet could I bear that too, well, very well;


    But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,


    Where either I must live or bear no life;


    The fountain from the which my current runs,


    Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads


    To knot and gender in!
Turn thy complexion there,


    Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,


    Ay, there, look grim as hell!
DESDEMONA.
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
OTHELLO.
O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,


    That quicken even with blowing.
O thou weed,


    Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet


    That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been


born!
DESDEMONA.
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
OTHELLO.
Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,


    Made to write "whore" upon?
What committed?
Committed?
O thou public commoner!
I should make very forges of my cheeks,


    That would to cinders burn up modesty,


    Did I but speak thy deeds.
What committed!
Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;


    The bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets,


    Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,


    And will not hear it.
What committed?
Impudent strumpet!
DESDEMONA.
By heaven, you do me wrong.
OTHELLO.
Are not you a strumpet?
DESDEMONA.
No, as I am a Christian.
If to preserve this vessel for my lord


    From any other foul unlawful touch


    Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.
OTHELLO.
What, not a whore?
DESDEMONA.
No, as I shall be saved.
OTHELLO.
Is't possible?
DESDEMONA.
O, heaven forgive us!
OTHELLO.
I cry you mercy then;


    I took you for that cunning whore of Venice


    That married with Othello.
[Raises his voice.]
You, mistress,


    That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,


    And keep the gate of hell!
Re-enter Emilia.
You, you, ay, you!
We have done our course; there's money for your pains.
I pray you, turn the key, and keep our counsel.
Exit.
EMILIA.
Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
How do you, madam?
How do you, my good lady?
DESDEMONA.
Faith, half asleep.
EMILIA.
Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
DESDEMONA.
With who?
EMILIA.
Why, with my lord, madam.
DESDEMONA.
Who is thy lord?
EMILIA.
He that is yours, sweet lady.
DESDEMONA.
I have none.
Do not talk to me, Emilia;


    I cannot weep, nor answer have I none


    But what should go by water.
Prithee, tonight


    Lay on my bed my wedding sheets.
Remember,


    And call thy husband hither.
EMILIA.
Here's a change indeed!
Exit.
DESDEMONA.
'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
How have I been behaved, that he might stick


    The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
Re-enter Emilia with Iago.
IAGO.
What is your pleasure, madam?
How is't with you?
DESDEMONA.
I cannot tell.
Those that do teach young babes


    Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.
He might have chid me so, for in good faith,


    I am a child to chiding.
IAGO.
What's the matter, lady?
EMILIA.
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,


    Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,


    As true hearts cannot bear.
DESDEMONA.
Am I that name, Iago?
IAGO.
What name, fair lady?
DESDEMONA.
Such as she says my lord did say I was.
EMILIA.
He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink


    Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.
IAGO.
Why did he so?
DESDEMONA.
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
IAGO.
Do not weep, do not weep.
Alas the day!
EMILIA.
Hath she forsook so many noble matches,


    Her father and her country and her friends,


    To be call'd whore?
Would it not make one weep?
DESDEMONA.
It is my wretched fortune.
IAGO.
Beshrew him for't!
How comes this trick upon him?
DESDEMONA.
Nay, heaven doth know.
EMILIA.
I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,


    Some busy and insinuating rogue,


    Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,


    Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.
IAGO.
Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
DESDEMONA.
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
EMILIA.
A halter pardon him!
And hell gnaw his bones!
Why should he call her whore?
Who keeps her company?
What place?
What time?
What form?
What likelihood?
The Moor's abused by some most villainous knave,


    Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,


    And put in every honest hand a whip


    To lash the rascals naked through the world


    Even from the east to the west!
IAGO.
Speak within door.
EMILIA.
O, fie upon them!
Some such squire he was


    That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,


    And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
IAGO.
You are a fool; go to.
DESDEMONA.
O good Iago,


    What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend, go to him, for by this light of heaven,


    I know not how I lost him.
Here I kneel:


    If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love


    Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,


    Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,


    Delighted them in any other form,


    Or that I do not yet, and ever did,


    And ever will, though he do shake me off


    To beggarly divorcement, love him dearly,


    Comfort forswear me!
Unkindness may do much,


    And his unkindness may defeat my life,


    But never taint my love.
I cannot say "whore."
It doth abhor me now I speak the word;


    To do the act that might the addition earn


    Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.
IAGO.
I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humor:


    The business of the state does him offense,


    And he does chide with you.
DESDEMONA.
If 'twere no other—


  IAGO.
'Tis but so, I warrant.
Trumpets


within.
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
The messengers of Venice stay the meat.
Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
Exeunt Desdemona and


Emilia.
Enter Roderigo.
How now, Roderigo!
RODERIGO.
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
IAGO.
What in the contrary?
RODERIGO.
Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and


    rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all


conveniency


    than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope.
I will


indeed


    no longer endure it; nor am I yet persuaded to put up in


peace


    what already I have foolishly suffered.
IAGO.
Will you hear me, Roderigo?
RODERIGO.
Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and


    performances are no kin together.
IAGO.
You charge me most unjustly.
RODERIGO.
With nought but truth.
I have wasted myself out of my


    means.
The jewels you have had from me to deliver to


Desdemona


    would half have corrupted a votarist.
You have told me she


hath


    received them and returned me expectations and comforts of


sudden


    respect and acquaintance; but I find none.
IAGO.
Well, go to, very well.
RODERIGO.
Very well!
go to!
I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not


very


    well.
By this hand, I say 'tis very scurvy, and begin to find


    myself fopped in it.
IAGO.
Very well.
RODERIGO.
I tell you 'tis not very well.
I will make myself


known


    to Desdemona.
If she will return me my jewels, I will give


over


    my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, assure


    yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.
IAGO.
You have said now.
RODERIGO.
Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of


    doing.
IAGO.
Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this


    instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before.
Give


    me thy hand, Roderigo.
Thou hast taken against me a most just


    exception; but yet, I protest, I have dealt most directly in


thy


    affair.
RODERIGO.
It hath not appeared.
IAGO.
I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion


is


    not without wit and judgement.
But, Roderigo, if thou hast


that


    in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now


than


    ever, I mean purpose, courage, and valor, this night show it;


if


    thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me


from


    this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.
RODERIGO.
Well, what is it?
Is it within reason and compass?
IAGO.
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to


depute


    Cassio in Othello's place.
RODERIGO.
Is that true?
Why then Othello and Desdemona return


again


    to Venice.
IAGO.
O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him


the


    fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some


    accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing


of


    Cassio.
RODERIGO.
How do you mean, removing of him?
IAGO.
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking


out


    his brains.
RODERIGO.
And that you would have me to do?
IAGO.
Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
He sups


    tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him.
He


knows


    not yet of his honorable fortune.
If you will watch his going


    thence, which his will fashion to fall out between twelve and


    one, you may take him at your pleasure; I will be near to


second


    your attempt, and he shall fall between us.
Come, stand not


    amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a


    necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to


put


    it on him.
It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to


    waste.
About it.
RODERIGO.
I will hear further reason for this.
IAGO.
And you shall be satisfied.
Exeunt.
Enter Othello, Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia, and Attendants.
LODOVICO.
I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
OTHELLO.
O, pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk.
LODOVICO.
Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.
DESDEMONA.
Your honor is most welcome.
OTHELLO.
Will you walk, sir?
O—Desdemona—


  DESDEMONA.
My lord?
OTHELLO.
Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned


    forthwith.
Dismiss your attendant there; look it be done.
DESDEMONA.
I will, my lord.
Exeunt Othello, Lodovico, and


Attendants.
EMILIA.
How goes it now?
He looks gentler than he did.
DESDEMONA.
He says he will return incontinent.
He hath commanded me to go to bed,


    And bade me to dismiss you.
EMILIA.
Dismiss me?
DESDEMONA.
It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,


    Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.
We must not now displease him.
EMILIA.
I would you had never seen him!
DESDEMONA.
So would not I.
My love doth so approve him,


    That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns—


    Prithee, unpin me—have grace and favor in them.
EMILIA.
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
DESDEMONA.
All's one.
Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
If I do die before thee, prithee shroud me


    In one of those same sheets.
EMILIA.
Come, come, you talk.
DESDEMONA.
My mother had a maid call'd Barbary;


    She was in love, and he she loved proved mad


    And did forsake her.
She had a song of "willow";


    An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,


    And she died singing it.
That song tonight


    Will not go from my mind; I have much to do


    But to go hang my head all at one side


    And sing it like poor Barbary.
Prithee, dispatch.
EMILIA.
Shall I go fetch your nightgown?
DESDEMONA.
No, unpin me here.
This Lodovico is a proper man.
EMILIA.
A very handsome man.
DESDEMONA.
He speaks well.
EMILIA.
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to


    Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
DESDEMONA.
[Sings.]
"The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,


          Sing all a green willow;


        Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,


          Sing willow, willow, willow.
The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans,


          Sing willow, willow, willow;


        Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones—"


    Lay by these—
    [Sings.]
"Sing willow, willow, willow—"
    Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon—


    [Sings.]
"Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve—"


    Nay, that's not next.
Hark, who is't that knocks?
EMILIA.
It's the wind.
DESDEMONA.
[Sings.]
"I call'd my love false love; but what said he then?
Sing willow, willow, willow.
If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men—"


    So get thee gone; good night.
Mine eyes do itch;


    Doth that bode weeping?
EMILIA.
'Tis neither here nor there.
DESDEMONA.
I have heard it said so.
O, these men, these men!
Dost thou in conscience think—tell me, Emilia—


    That there be women do abuse their husbands


    In such gross kind?
EMILIA.
There be some such, no question.
DESDEMONA.
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
EMILIA.
Why, would not you?
DESDEMONA.
No, by this heavenly light!
EMILIA.
Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as


well


    i' the dark.
DESDEMONA.
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
EMILIA.
The world's a huge thing; it is a great price


    For a small vice.
DESDEMONA.
In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
EMILIA.
In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.
Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for


    measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor


any


    petty exhibition; but, for the whole world—why, who would


not


    make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch?
I should


    venture purgatory for't.
DESDEMONA.
Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong


    For the whole world.
EMILIA.
Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having


the


    world for your labor, 'tis a wrong in your own world, and you


    might quickly make it right.
DESDEMONA.
I do not think there is any such woman.
EMILIA.
Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would store


the


      world they played for.
But I do think it is their husbands' faults


    If wives do fall; say that they slack their duties


    And pour our treasures into foreign laps,


    Or else break out in peevish jealousies,


    Throwing restraint upon us, or say they strike us,


    Or scant our former having in despite,


    Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,


    Yet have we some revenge.
Let husbands know


    Their wives have sense like them; they see and smell


    And have their palates both for sweet and sour,


    As husbands have.
What is it that they do


    When they change us for others?
Is it sport?
I think it is.
And doth affection breed it?
I think it doth.
Is't frailty that thus errs?
It is so too.
And have not we affections,


    Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Then let them use us well; else let them know,


    The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
DESDEMONA.
Good night, good night.
Heaven me such uses send,


    Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!
Exeunt.

Enter Iago and Roderigo:
  IAGO.
Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come.
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.
Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow.
It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,


    And fix most firm thy resolution.
RODERIGO.
Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
IAGO.
Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand.
Retires.
RODERIGO.
I have no great devotion to the deed;


    And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.
'Tis but a man gone.
Forth, my sword; he dies.
IAGO.
I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,


    And he grows angry.
Now, whether he kill Cassio,


    Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,


    Every way makes my gain.
Live Roderigo,


    He calls me to a restitution large


    Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,


    As gifts to Desdemona;


    It must not be.
If Cassio do remain,


    He hath a daily beauty in his life


    That makes me ugly; and besides, the Moor


    May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril.
No, he must die.
Be't so.
I hear him coming.
Enter Cassio.
RODERIGO.
I know his gait; 'tis he.
Villain, thou diest!
Makes a pass at


Cassio.
CASSIO.
That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,


    But that my coat is better than thou know'st;


    I will make proof of thine.
Draws, and wounds


Roderigo.
RODERIGO.
O, I am slain!
Iago from behind wounds Cassio in the leg, and exit.
CASSIO.
I am maim'd forever.
Help, ho!
Murther!
Murther!
Falls.
Enter Othello.
OTHELLO.
The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word.
RODERIGO.
O, villain that I am!
OTHELLO.
It is even so.
CASSIO.
O, help, ho!
Light!
A surgeon!
OTHELLO.
'Tis he.
O brave Iago, honest and just,


    That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
Thou teachest me.
Minion, your dear lies dead,


    And your unblest fate hies.
Strumpet, I come!
Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;


    Thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted.
Exit.
Enter Lodovico and Gratiano.
CASSIO.
What, ho!
No watch?
No passage?
Murther!
Murther!
GRATIANO.
'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
CASSIO.
O, help!
LODOVICO.
Hark!
RODERIGO.
O wretched villain!
LODOVICO.
Two or three groan; it is a heavy night.
These may be counterfeits; let's think't unsafe


    To come in to the cry without more help.
RODERIGO.
Nobody come?
Then shall I bleed to death.
LODOVICO.
Hark!
Re-enter Iago, with a light.
GRATIANO.
Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and


weapons.
IAGO.
Who's there?
Whose noise is this that cries on murther?
LODOVICO.
We do not know.
IAGO.
Did not you hear a cry?
CASSIO.
Here, here!
for heaven's sake, help me!
IAGO.
What's the matter?
GRATIANO.
This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
LODOVICO.
The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
IAGO.
What are you here that cry so grievously?
CASSIO.
Iago?
O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
Give me some help.
IAGO.
O me, lieutenant!
What villains have done this?
CASSIO.
I think that one of them is hereabout,


    And cannot make away.
IAGO.
O treacherous villains!
[To Lodovico and Gratiano.]
What are you there?
Come in and give some help.
RODERIGO.
O, help me here!
CASSIO.
That's one of them.
IAGO.
O murtherous slave!
O villain!
Stabs


Roderigo.
RODERIGO.
O damn'd Iago!
O inhuman dog!
IAGO.
Kill men i' the dark!
Where be these bloody thieves?
How silent is this town!
Ho!
Murther!
Murther!
What may you be?
Are you of good or evil?
LODOVICO.
As you shall prove us, praise us.
IAGO.
Signior Lodovico?
LODOVICO.
He, sir.
IAGO.
I cry you mercy.
Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
GRATIANO.
Cassio?
IAGO.
How is't, brother?
CASSIO.
My leg is cut in two.
IAGO.
Marry, heaven forbid!
Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
Enter Bianca.
BIANCA.
What is the matter, ho?
Who is't that cried?
IAGO.
Who is't that cried?
BIANCA.
O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio!
O Cassio, Cassio,


     Cassio!
IAGO.
O notable strumpet!
Cassio, may you suspect


    Who they should be that have thus mangled you?
CASSIO.
No.
GRATIANO.
I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.
IAGO.
Lend me a garter.
So.
O, for a chair,


    To bear him easily hence!
BIANCA.
Alas, he faints!
O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
IAGO.
Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash


    To be a party in this injury.
Patience awhile, good Cassio.
Come, come;


    Lend me a light.
Know we this face or no?
Alas, my friend and my dear countryman


    Roderigo?
No—yes, sure.
O heaven!
Roderigo.
GRATIANO.
What, of Venice?
IAGO.
Even he, sir.
Did you know him?
GRATIANO.
Know him!
ay.
IAGO.
Signior Gratiano?
I cry you gentle pardon;


    These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,


    That so neglected you.
GRATIANO.
I am glad to see you.
IAGO.
How do you, Cassio?
O, a chair, a chair!
GRATIANO.
Roderigo!
IAGO.
He, he, 'tis he.
[A chair brought in.]
O, that's well


said:


      the chair.
Some good man bear him carefully from hence;


    I'll fetch the general's surgeon.
[To Bianca.]
For you,


mistress,


    Save you your labor.
He that lies slain here, Cassio,


    Was my dear friend; what malice was between you?
CASSIO.
None in the world; nor do I know the man.
IAGO.
[To Bianca.]
What, look you pale?
O, bear him out o' the


air.
Cassio and Roderigo are borne


off.
Stay you, good gentlemen.
Look you pale, mistress?
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her.
Do you see, gentlemen?
Nay, guiltiness will speak,


    Though tongues were out of use.
Enter Emilia.
EMILIA.
'Las, what's the matter?
What's the matter, husband?
IAGO.
Cassio hath here been set on in the dark


    By Roderigo, and fellows that are 'scaped;


    He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.
EMILIA.
Alas, good gentleman!
alas, good Cassio!
IAGO.
This is the fruit of whoring.
Prithee, Emilia,


    Go know of Cassio where he supp'd tonight.
What, do you shake at that?
BIANCA.
He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
IAGO.
O, did he so?
I charge you, go with me.
EMILIA.
Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!
BIANCA.
I am no strumpet, but of life as honest


    As you that thus abuse me.
EMILIA.
As I!
foh!
fie upon thee!
IAGO.
Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
Emilia, run you to the citadel,


    And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd!
Will you go on?
[Aside.]
This is the night


    That either makes me or fordoes me quite.
Exeunt.
Enter Othello.
OTHELLO.
It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!
It is the cause.
Yet I'll not shed her blood,


    Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow


    And smooth as monumental alabaster.
Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
Put out the light, and then put out the light.
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,


    I can again thy former light restore,


    Should I repent me; but once put out thy light,


    Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,


    I know not where is that Promethean heat


    That can thy light relume.
When I have pluck'd the rose,


    I cannot give it vital growth again,


    It must needs wither; I'll smell it on the tree.
Kisses


her.
O, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade


    Justice to break her sword!
One more, one more;


    Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,


    And love thee after.
One more, and this the last;


    So sweet was ne'er so fatal.
I must weep,


    But they are cruel tears; this sorrow's heavenly,


    It strikes where it doth love.
She wakes.
DESDEMONA.
Who's there?
Othello?
OTHELLO.
Ay, Desdemona.
DESDEMONA.
Will you come to bed, my lord?
OTHELLO.
Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?
DESDEMONA.
Ay, my lord.
OTHELLO.
If you bethink yourself of any crime


    Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,


    Solicit for it straight.
DESDEMONA.
Alas, my lord, what may you mean by that?
OTHELLO.
Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by.
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit.
No, heaven forfend!
I would not kill thy soul.
DESDEMONA.
Talk you of killing?
OTHELLO.
Ay, I do.
DESDEMONA.
Then heaven have mercy on me!
OTHELLO.
Amen, with all my heart!
DESDEMONA.
If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.
OTHELLO.
Hum!
DESDEMONA.
And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then


    When your eyes roll so.
Why I should fear I know not,


    Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.
OTHELLO.
Think on thy sins.
DESDEMONA.
They are loves I bear to you.
OTHELLO.
Ay, and for that thou diest.
DESDEMONA.
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.
These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,


    They do not point on me.
OTHELLO.
Peace, and be still!
DESDEMONA.
I will so.
What's the matter?
OTHELLO.
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee


    Thou gavest to Cassio.
DESDEMONA.
No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man, and ask him.
OTHELLO.
Sweet soul, take heed,


    Take heed of perjury; thou are on thy deathbed.
DESDEMONA.
Ay, but not yet to die.
OTHELLO.
Yes, presently:


    Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin,


    For to deny each article with oath


    Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception


    That I do groan withal.
Thou art to die.
DESDEMONA.
Then Lord have mercy on me!
OTHELLO.
I say, amen.
DESDEMONA.
And have you mercy too!
I never did


    Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio


    But with such general warranty of heaven


    As I might love.
I never gave him token.
OTHELLO.
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in 's hand.
O perjured woman!
Thou dost stone my heart,


    And makest me call what I intend to do


    A murther, which I thought a sacrifice.
I saw the handkerchief.
DESDEMONA.
He found it then;


    I never gave it him.
Send for him hither;


    Let him confess a truth.
OTHELLO.
He hath confess'd.
DESDEMONA.
What, my lord?
OTHELLO.
That he hath used thee.
DESDEMONA.
How?
unlawfully?
OTHELLO.
Ay.
DESDEMONA.
He will not say so.
OTHELLO.
No, his mouth is stopp'd;


    Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.
DESDEMONA.
O, my fear interprets!
What, is he dead?
OTHELLO.
Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge


    Had stomach for them all.
DESDEMONA.
Alas, he is betray'd, and I undone!
OTHELLO.
Out, strumpet!
Weep'st thou for him to my face?
DESDEMONA.
O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!
OTHELLO.
Down, strumpet!
DESDEMONA.
Kill me tomorrow; let me live tonight!
OTHELLO.
Nay, if you strive—


  DESDEMONA.
But half an hour!
OTHELLO.
Being done, there is no pause.
DESDEMONA.
But while I say one prayer!
OTHELLO.
It is too late.
He stifles


her.
EMILIA.
[Within.]
My lord, my lord!
What, ho!
my lord, my lord!
OTHELLO.
What noise is this?
Not dead?
not yet quite dead?
I that am cruel am yet merciful;


    I would not have thee linger in thy pain.
So, so.
EMILIA.
[Within.]
What, ho!
my lord, my lord!
OTHELLO.
Who's there?
EMILIA.
[Within.]
O, good my lord, I would speak a word with


you!
OTHELLO.
Yes, 'tis Emilia.
By and by.
She's dead.
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.
The noise was here.
Ha!
no more moving?
Still as the grave.
Shall she come in?
were't good?
I think she stirs again.
No.
What's best to do?
If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife.
My wife!
My wife!
What wife?
I have no wife.
O, insupportable!
O heavy hour!
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse


    Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe


    Should yawn at alteration.
EMILIA.
[Within.]
I do beseech you


    That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!
OTHELLO.
I had forgot thee.
O, come in, Emilia.
Soft, by and by.
Let me the curtains draw.
Where art thou?
Unlocks the


door.
Enter Emilia.
What's the matter with thee now?
EMILIA.
O, my good lord, yonder's foul murthers done!
OTHELLO.
What, now?
EMILIA.
But now, my lord.
OTHELLO.
It is the very error of the moon;


    She comes more nearer earth than she was wont


    And makes men mad.
EMILIA.
Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian


    Call'd Roderigo.
OTHELLO.
Roderigo kill'd?
And Cassio kill'd?
EMILIA.
No, Cassio is not kill'd.
OTHELLO.
Not Cassio kill'd!
Then murther's out of tune,


    And sweet revenge grows harsh.
DESDEMONA.
O, falsely, falsely murther'd!
EMILIA.
Alas, what cry is


that?
OTHELLO.
That?
what?
EMILIA.
Out, and alas!
That was my lady's voice.
Help!
help, ho!
help!
O lady, speak again!
Sweet Desdemona!
O sweet mistress, speak!
DESDEMONA.
A guiltless death I die.
EMILIA.
O, who hath done this deed?
DESDEMONA.
Nobody; I myself.
Farewell;


    Commend me to my kind lord.
O, farewell!
Dies.
OTHELLO.
Why, how should she be murther'd?
EMILIA.
Alas, who knows?
OTHELLO.
You heard her say herself, it was not I.


  EMILIA.
She said so; I must needs report the truth.
OTHELLO.
She's like a liar gone to burning hell;


    'Twas I that kill'd her.
EMILIA.
O, the more angel she,


    And you the blacker devil!
OTHELLO.
She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
EMILIA.
Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
OTHELLO.
She was false as water.
EMILIA.
Thou art rash as fire, to say


    That she was false.
O, she was heavenly true!
OTHELLO.
Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,


    But that I did proceed upon just grounds


    To this extremity.
Thy husband knew it all.
EMILIA.
My husband?
OTHELLO.
Thy husband.
EMILIA.
That she was false to wedlock?
OTHELLO.
Ay, with Cassio.
Nay, had she been true,


    If heaven would make me such another world


    Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,


    I'ld not have sold her for it.
EMILIA.
My husband?
OTHELLO.
Ay, 'twas he that told me first.
An honest man he is, and hates the slime


    That sticks on filthy deeds.
EMILIA.
My husband?
OTHELLO.
What needs this iteration, woman?
I say thy husband.
EMILIA.
O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!
My husband say that she was false!
OTHELLO.
He, woman;


    I say thy husband.
Dost understand the word?
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.
EMILIA.
If he say so, may his pernicious soul


    Rot half a grain a day!
He lies to the heart.
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.
OTHELLO.
Ha!
EMILIA.
Do thy worst;


    This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven


    Than thou wast worthy her.
OTHELLO.
Peace, you were best.
EMILIA.
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm


    As I have to be hurt.
O gull!
O dolt!
As ignorant as dirt!
Thou hast done a deed—


    I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,


    Though I lost twenty lives.
Help!
help, ho!
help!
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress!
Murther, murther!
Enter Montano, Gratiano, Iago, and others.
MONTANO.
What is the matter?
How now, general?
EMILIA.
O, are you come, Iago?
You have done well,


    That men must lay their murthers on your neck.
GRATIANO.
What is the matter?
EMILIA.
Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man.
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false;


    I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain.
Speak, for my heart is full.
IAGO.
I told him what I thought, and told no more


    Than what he found himself was apt and true.
EMILIA.
But did you ever tell him she was false?
IAGO.
I did.
EMILIA.
You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;


    Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!
She false with Cassio?
Did you say with Cassio?
IAGO.
With Cassio, mistress.
Go to, charm your tongue.
EMILIA.
I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak.
My mistress here lies murther'd in her bed—


  ALL.
O heavens forfend!
EMILIA.
And your reports have set the murther on.
OTHELLO.
Nay, stare not, masters; it is true indeed.
GRATIANO.
'Tis a strange truth.
MONTANO.
O monstrous act!
EMILIA.
Villainy, villainy, villainy!
I think upon't, I think, I smell't, O villainy!
I thought so then.
I'll kill myself for grief.
O villainy, villainy!
IAGO.
What, are you mad?
I charge you, get you home.
EMILIA.
Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak;


    'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
OTHELLO.
O!
O!
O!
Falls on the


bed.
EMILIA.
Nay, lay thee down and roar;


    For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent


    That e'er did lift up eye.
OTHELLO.
[Rises.]
O, she was foul!
I scarce did know you, uncle; there lies your niece,


    Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd.
I know this act shows horrible and grim.
GRATIANO.
Poor Desdemon!
I am glad thy father's dead.
Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief


    Shore his old thread in twain; did he live now,


    This sight would make him do a desperate turn,


    Yea, curse his better angel from his side,


    And fall to reprobation.
OTHELLO.
'Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows


    That she with Cassio hath the act of shame


    A thousand times committed.
Cassio confess'd it,


    And she did gratify his amorous works


    With that recognizance and pledge of love


    Which I first gave her.
I saw it in his hand,


    It was a handkerchief, an antique token


    My father gave my mother.
EMILIA.
O heaven!
O heavenly powers!
IAGO.
'Zounds!
Hold your peace.
EMILIA.
'Twill out, 'twill.
I peace?
No, I will speak as liberal as the north;


    Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,


    All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.
IAGO.
Be wise, and get you home.
EMILIA.
I will not.
Iago offers to stab


Emilia.
GRATIANO.
Fie!
Your sword upon a woman?
EMILIA.
O thou dull Moor!
That handkerchief thou speak'st of


    I found by fortune and did give my husband,


    For often with a solemn earnestness,


    More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,


    He begg'd of me to steal it.
IAGO.
Villainous whore!
EMILIA.
She give it Cassio?
No, alas, I found it,


    And I did give't my husband.
IAGO.
Filth, thou liest!
EMILIA.
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
O murtherous coxcomb!
What should such a fool


    Do with so good a wife?
OTHELLO.
Are there not stones in heaven


    But what serve for thunder?
Precious villain!
He runs at Iago, but


Montano


                                      disarms him.
Iago stabs


Emilia.
GRATIANO.
The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
EMILIA.
Ay, ay!
O, lay me by my mistress' side.
Exit


Iago.
GRATIANO.
He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.
MONTANO.
'Tis a notorious villain.
Take you this weapon,


    Which I have here recover'd from the Moor.
Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,


    But kill him rather.
I'll after that same villain,


    For 'tis a damned slave.
Exeunt all but Othello and


Emilia.
OTHELLO.
I am not valiant neither,


    But every puny whipster gets my sword.
But why should honor outlive honesty?
Let it go all.
EMILIA.
What did thy song bode, lady?
Hark, canst thou hear me?
I will play the swan,


    And die in music.
[Sings.]
"Willow, willow, willow."
Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;


    So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;


    So speaking as I think, I die, I die.
Dies.
OTHELLO.
I have another weapon in this chamber;


    It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper—


    O, here it is.
Uncle, I must come forth.
GRATIANO.
[Within.]
If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear.
Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.
OTHELLO.
Look in upon me then, and speak with me,


    Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.
Re-enter Gratiano.
GRATIANO.
What is the matter?
OTHELLO.
Behold, I have a weapon;


    A better never did itself sustain


    Upon a soldier's thigh.
I have seen the day


    That with this little arm and this good sword


    I have made my way through more impediments


    Than twenty times your stop.
But, O vain boast!
Who can control his fate?
'Tis not so now.
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;


    Here is my journey's end, here is my butt


    And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
Do you go back dismay'd?
'Tis a lost fear.
Man but a rush against Othello's breast,


    And he retires.
Where should Othello go?
Now, how dost thou look now?
O ill-starr'd wench!
Pale as thy smock!
When we shall meet at compt,


    This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,


    And fiends will snatch at it.
Cold, cold, my girl?
Even like thy chastity.
O cursed, cursed slave!
Whip me, ye devils,


    From the possession of this heavenly sight!
Blow me about in winds!
Roast me in sulphur!
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
O Desdemon!
dead, Desdemon!
dead!
O!
O!
O!
Enter Lodovico, Montano, Cassio carried in a chair,


                  and Officers with Iago, prisoner.
LODOVICO.
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
OTHELLO.
That's he that was Othello.
Here I am.
LODOVICO.
Where is that viper?
Bring the villain forth.
OTHELLO.
I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee.
Wounds


Iago.
LODOVICO.
Wrench his sword from him.
IAGO.
I bleed, sir, but not


kill'd.
OTHELLO.
I am not sorry neither.
I'ld have thee live,


    For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.
LODOVICO.
O thou Othello, that wert once so good,


    Fall'n in the practice of a damned slave,


    What shall be said to thee?
OTHELLO.
Why, anything;


    An honorable murtherer, if you will,


    For nought did I in hate, but all in honor.
LODOVICO.
This wretch hath part confess'd his villainy.
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?
OTHELLO.
Ay.
CASSIO.
Dear general, I never gave you cause.
OTHELLO.
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil


    Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?
IAGO.
Demand me nothing; what you know, you know.
From this time forth I never will speak word.
LODOVICO.
What, not to pray?
GRATIANO.
Torments will ope your lips.
OTHELLO.
Well, thou dost best.
LODOVICO.
Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,


    Which, as I think, you know not.
Here is a letter


    Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,


    And here another.
The one of them imports


    The death of Cassio to be undertook


    By Roderigo.
OTHELLO.
O villain!
CASSIO.
Most heathenish and most gross!
LODOVICO.
Now here's another discontented paper,


    Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,


    Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;


    But that, belike, Iago in the interim


    Came in and satisfied him.
OTHELLO.
O the pernicious caitiff!
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief


    That was my wife's?
CASSIO.
I found it in my chamber;


    And he himself confess'd but even now


    That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose


    Which wrought to his desire.
OTHELLO.
O fool!
fool!
fool!
CASSIO.
There is besides in Roderigo's letter,


    How he upbraids Iago, that he made him


    Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came


    That I was cast.
And even but now he spake


    After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,


    Iago set him on.
LODOVICO.
You must forsake this room, and go with us.
Your power and your command is taken off,


    And Cassio rules in Cyprus.
For this slave,


    If there be any cunning cruelty


    That can torment him much and hold him long,


    It shall be his.
You shall close prisoner rest,


    Till that the nature of your fault be known


    To the Venetian state.
Come, bring away.
OTHELLO.
Soft you; a word or two before you go.
I have done the state some service, and they know't.
No more of that.
I pray you, in your letters,


    When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,


    Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,


    Nor set down aught in malice.
Then must you speak


    Of one that loved not wisely but too well;


    Of one not easily jealous, but, being wrought,


    Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,


    Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away


    Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,


    Albeit unused to the melting mood,


    Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees


    Their medicinal gum.
Set you down this;


    And say besides, that in Aleppo once,


    Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk


    Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,


    I took by the throat the circumcised dog


    And smote him, thus.
Stabs


himself.
LODOVICO.
O bloody period!
GRATIANO.
All that's spoke is marr'd.
OTHELLO.
I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee.
No way but this,


    Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
Falls on the bed, and


dies.
CASSIO.
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;


    For he was great of heart.
LODOVICO.
[To Iago.]
O Spartan dog,


    More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!
We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.
A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.
To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.
Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.
Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.
The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.
This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.
If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.
[10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.
At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.
We need your donations more than ever!
All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.
(CMU = Carnegie-
Mellon University).

Why is this "Small Print!"
statement here?
You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.
So, among other things, this "Small Print!"
statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.
It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.
*BEFORE!

etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").
Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!)
can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.
Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.
To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.
Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".
Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.
If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.
If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.
Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.
INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.
DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!"
and all other references to Project Gutenberg,

     etext or this "small print!"
statement.
You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR
     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR
     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC

As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a "cliche".
.
.this is the
original meaning of the term cliche.
.
.and thus, being unwilling
to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd.
.
.such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
above.
.
.and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner.
.
.
.
The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
time when they were out of "v"'s.
.
.possibly having used "vv" in
place of some "w"'s, etc.
This was a common practice of the day,
as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.
You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.
My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose.
To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
.
.
.in great detail.
.
.and determined from the various changes,
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
for signing his name with several different spellings.
So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
that are "not" errors.
.
.
.
So.
.
.with this caveat.
.
.we have NOT changed the canon errors,
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie
of Romeo and Juliet.

Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.
This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text.
The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae.
I have left the spelling,
punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text.
I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them.
Everything within
brackets [] is what I have added.
So if you don't like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare.
Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio.
So there may
be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
this and other first folio editions.
This is due to the printer's
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run.
The proof run wasn't thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies.
This is just the way it is.
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions' best pages.
If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors.
I wish to make this the best
etext possible.
My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
and davidr@inconnect.com.
I hope that you enjoy this.

No, for then we should be Colliars
   Samp.
I mean, if we be in choller, wee'l draw
   Greg.
I, While you liue, draw your necke out
o'th Collar
   Samp.
I strike quickly, being mou'd
   Greg.
But thou art not quickly mou'd to strike
   Samp.
A dog of the house of Mountague, moues me
   Greg.
To moue, is to stir: and to be valiant, is to stand:


Therefore, if thou art mou'd, thou runst away


   Samp.
A dogge of that house shall moue me to stand.
I will take the wall of any Man or Maid of Mountagues


   Greg.
That shewes thee a weake slaue, for the weakest


goes to the wall


   Samp.
True, and therefore women being the weaker


Vessels, are euer thrust to the wall: therefore I will push


Mountagues men from the wall, and thrust his Maides to


the wall


   Greg.
The Quarrell is betweene our Masters, and vs their men
   Samp.
'Tis all one, I will shew my selfe a tyrant: when


I haue fought with the men, I will bee ciuill with the


Maids, and cut off their heads


   Greg.
The heads of the Maids?
Sam.
I, the heads of the Maids, or their Maiden-heads,


Take it in what sence thou wilt


   Greg.
They must take it sence, that feele it
   Samp.
Me they shall feele while I am able to stand:


And 'tis knowne I am a pretty peece of flesh


   Greg.
'Tis well thou art not Fish: If thou had'st, thou
had'st beene poore Iohn.
Draw thy Toole, here comes of
the House of the Mountagues.
Enter two other Seruingmen.

   Sam.
Let vs take the Law of our sides: let them begin
   Gr.
I wil frown as I passe by, & let the[m] take it as they list


  Sam.
Nay, as they dare.
I wil bite my Thumb at them,


which is a disgrace to them, if they beare it


   Abra.
Do you bite your Thumbe at vs sir?
Samp.
I do bite my Thumbe, sir


   Abra.
Do you bite your Thumb at vs, sir?
Sam.
Is the Law of our side, if I say I?
Gre.
No


   Sam.
No sir, I do not bite my Thumbe at you sir: but


I bite my Thumbe sir


   Greg.
Do you quarrell sir?
Abra.
Quarrell sir?

   Sam.
If you do sir, I am for you, I serue as good a man as you


  Abra.
No better?
Samp.
Well sir.
Enter Benuolio.

Ben.
Part Fooles, put vp your Swords, you know not


what you do.
Enter Tibalt.
Tyb.
What art thou drawne, among these heartlesse


Hindes?
Turne thee Benuolio, looke vpon thy death


   Ben.
I do but keepe the peace, put vp thy Sword,


Or manage it to part these men with me


   Tyb.
What draw, and talke of peace?
I hate the word


As I hate hell, all Mountagues, and thee:


Haue at thee Coward.
Fight.
Enter three or foure Citizens with Clubs.
Offi.
Clubs, Bils, and Partisons, strike, beat them down


Downe with the Capulets, downe with the Mountagues.
Enter old Capulet in his Gowne, and his wife.
Cap.
What noise is this?
Giue me my long Sword ho
   Wife.
A crutch, a crutch: why call you for a Sword?
Cap.
My Sword I say: Old Mountague is come,


And flourishes his Blade in spight of me.
Enter old Mountague, & his wife.
Moun.
Thou villaine Capulet.
Hold me not, let me go


  2.Wife.
Thou shalt not stir a foote to seeke a Foe.
Enter Prince Eskales, with his Traine.
Prince.
Rebellious Subiects, Enemies to peace,


Prophaners of this Neighbor-stained Steele,


Will they not heare?
What hoe, you Men, you Beasts,


That quench the fire of your pernitious Rage,


With purple Fountaines issuing from your Veines:


On paine of Torture, from those bloody hands


Throw your mistemper'd Weapons to the ground,


And heare the Sentence of your mooued Prince.
Three ciuill Broyles, bred of an Ayery word,


By thee old Capulet and Mountague,


Haue thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,


And made Verona's ancient Citizens


Cast by their Graue beseeming Ornaments,


To wield old Partizans, in hands as old,


Cankred with peace, to part your Cankred hate,


If euer you disturbe our streets againe,


Your liues shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time all the rest depart away:


You Capulet shall goe along with me,


And Mountague come you this afternoone,


To know our Fathers pleasure in this case:


To old Free-towne, our common iudgement place:


Once more on paine of death, all men depart.
Exeunt.
Moun.
Who set this auncient quarrell new abroach?
Speake Nephew, were you by, when it began:


  Ben.
Heere were the seruants of your aduersarie,


And yours close fighting ere I did approach,


I drew to part them, in the instant came


The fiery Tibalt, with his sword prepar'd,


Which as he breath'd defiance to my eares,


He swong about his head, and cut the windes,


Who nothing hurt withall, hist him in scorne.
While we were enterchanging thrusts and blowes,


Came more and more, and fought on part and part,


Till the Prince came, who parted either part


   Wife.
O where is Romeo, saw you him to day?
Right glad am I, he was not at this fray


   Ben.
Madam, an houre before the worshipt Sun


Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,


A troubled mind draue me to walke abroad,


Where vnderneath the groue of Sycamour,


That West-ward rooteth from this City side:


So earely walking did I see your Sonne:


Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,


And stole into the couert of the wood,


I measuring his affections by my owne,


Which then most sought, wher most might not be found:


Being one too many by my weary selfe,


Pursued my Honour, not pursuing his


And gladly shunn'd, who gladly fled from me


   Mount.
Many a morning hath he there beene seene,


With teares augmenting the fresh mornings deaw,


Adding to cloudes, more cloudes with his deepe sighes,


But all so soone as the all-cheering Sunne,


Should in the farthest East begin to draw


The shadie Curtaines from Auroras bed,


Away from light steales home my heauy Sonne,


And priuate in his Chamber pennes himselfe,


Shuts vp his windowes, lockes faire day-light out,


And makes himselfe an artificiall night:


Blacke and portendous must this humour proue,


Vnlesse good counsell may the cause remoue


   Ben.
My Noble Vncle doe you know the cause?
Moun.
I neither know it, nor can learne of him


   Ben.
Haue you importun'd him by any meanes?
Moun.
Both by my selfe and many other Friends,


But he his owne affections counseller,


Is to himselfe (I will not say how true)


But to himselfe so secret and so close,


So farre from sounding and discouery,


As is the bud bit with an enuious worme,


Ere he can spread his sweete leaues to the ayre,


Or dedicate his beauty to the same.
Could we but learne from whence his sorrowes grow,


We would as willingly giue cure, as know.
Enter Romeo.
Ben.
See where he comes, so please you step aside,


Ile know his greeuance, or be much denide


   Moun.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,


To heare true shrift.
Come Madam let's away.
Exeunt.
Ben.
Good morrow Cousin
   Rom.
Is the day so young?
Ben.
But new strooke nine


   Rom.
Aye me, sad houres seeme long:


Was that my Father that went hence so fast?
Ben.
It was: what sadnes lengthens Romeo's houres?
Ro.
Not hauing that, which hauing, makes them short


  Ben.
In loue


   Romeo.
Out
   Ben.
Of loue
   Rom.
Out of her fauour where I am in loue
   Ben.
Alas that loue so gentle in his view,


Should be so tyrannous and rough in proofe


   Rom.
Alas that loue, whose view is muffled still,


Should without eyes, see path-wayes to his will:


Where shall we dine?
O me: what fray was heere?
Yet tell me not, for I haue heard it all:


Heere's much to do with hate, but more with loue:


Why then, O brawling loue, O louing hate,


O any thing, of nothing first created:


O heauie lightnesse, serious vanity,


Mishapen Chaos of welseeming formes,


Feather of lead, bright smoake, cold fire, sicke health,


Still waking sleepe, that is not what it is:


This loue feele I, that feele no loue in this.
Doest thou not laugh?
Ben.
No Coze, I rather weepe


   Rom.
Good heart, at what?
Ben.
At thy good hearts oppression


   Rom.
Why such is loues transgression.
Griefes of mine owne lie heauie in my breast,


Which thou wilt propagate to haue it preast


With more of thine, this loue that thou hast showne,


Doth adde more griefe, to too much of mine owne.
Loue, is a smoake made with the fume of sighes,


Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in Louers eyes,


Being vext, a Sea nourisht with louing teares,


What is it else?
a madnesse, most discreet,


A choking gall, and a preseruing sweet:


Farewell my Coze


   Ben.
Soft I will goe along.
And if you leaue me so, you do me wrong


   Rom.
Tut I haue lost my selfe, I am not here,


This is not Romeo, hee's some other where


   Ben.
Tell me in sadnesse, who is that you loue?
Rom.
What shall I grone and tell thee?
Ben.
Grone, why no: but sadly tell me who


   Rom.
A sicke man in sadnesse makes his will:


A word ill vrg'd to one that is so ill:


In sadnesse Cozin, I do loue a woman


   Ben.
I aym'd so neare, when I suppos'd you lou'd
   Rom.
A right good marke man, and shee's faire I loue


  Ben.
A right faire marke, faire Coze, is soonest hit


   Rom.
Well in that hit you misse, sheel not be hit


With Cupids arrow, she hath Dians wit:


And in strong proofe of chastity well arm'd:


From loues weake childish Bow, she liues vncharm'd.
Shee will not stay the siege of louing tearmes,


Nor bid th' encounter of assailing eyes.
Nor open her lap to Sainct-seducing Gold:


O she is rich in beautie, onely poore,


That when she dies, with beautie dies her store


   Ben.
Then she hath sworne, that she will still liue chast?
Rom.
She hath, and in that sparing make huge wast?
For beauty steru'd with her seuerity,


Cuts beauty off from all posteritie.
She is too faire, too wise: wisely too faire,


To merit blisse by making me dispaire:


She hath forsworne to loue, and in that vow


Do I liue dead, that liue to tell it now


   Ben.
Be rul'd by me, forget to thinke of her
   Rom.
O teach me how I should forget to thinke
   Ben.
By giuing liberty vnto thine eyes,


Examine other beauties,


  Ro.
'Tis the way to cal hers (exquisit) in question more,


These happy maskes that kisse faire Ladies browes,


Being blacke, puts vs in mind they hide the faire:


He that is strooken blind, cannot forget


The precious treasure of his eye-sight lost:


Shew me a Mistresse that is passing faire,


What doth her beauty serue but as a note,


Where I may read who past that passing faire.
Farewell thou can'st not teach me to forget,


  Ben.
Ile pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
Exeunt.
Enter Capulet, Countie Paris, and the Clowne.
Capu.
Mountague is bound as well as I,


In penalty alike, and 'tis not hard I thinke,


For men so old as wee, to keepe the peace


   Par.
Of Honourable reckoning are you both,


And pittie 'tis you liu'd at ods so long:


But now my Lord, what say you to my sute?
Capu.
But saying ore what I haue said before,


My Child is yet a stranger in the world,


Shee hath not seene the change of fourteene yeares,


Let two more Summers wither in their pride,


Ere we may thinke her ripe to be a Bride


   Pari.
Younger then she, are happy mothers made
   Capu.
And too soone mar'd are those so early made:


Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,


Shee's the hopefull Lady of my earth:


But wooe her gentle Paris, get her heart,


My will to her consent, is but a part,


And shee agree, within her scope of choise,


Lyes my consent, and faire according voice:


This night I hold an old accustom'd Feast,


Whereto I haue inuited many a Guest,


Such as I loue, and you among the store,


One more, most welcome makes my number more:


At my poore house, looke to behold this night,


Earth-treading starres, that make darke heauen light,


Such comfort as do lusty young men feele,


When well apparrel'd Aprill on the heele


Of limping Winter treads, euen such delight


Among fresh Fennell buds shall you this night


Inherit at my house: heare all, all see:


And like her most, whose merit most shall be:


Which one more veiw, of many, mine being one,


May stand in number, though in reckning none.
Come, goe with me: goe sirrah trudge about,


Through faire Verona, find those persons out,


Whose names are written there, and to them say,


My house and welcome, on their pleasure stay.
Enter.
Ser.
Find them out whose names are written.
Heere it
is written, that the Shoo-maker should meddle with his
Yard, and the Tayler with his Last, the Fisher with his
Pensill, and the Painter with his Nets.
But I am sent to
find those persons whose names are writ, & can neuer find
what names the writing person hath here writ (I must to
the learned) in good time.
Enter Benuolio, and Romeo.
Ben.
Tut man, one fire burnes out anothers burning,


One paine is lesned by anothers anguish:


Turne giddie, and be holpe by backward turning:


One desparate greefe, cures with anothers languish:


Take thou some new infection to the eye,


And the rank poyson of the old wil die


   Rom.
Your Plantan leafe is excellent for that
   Ben.
For what I pray thee?
Rom.
For your broken shin


   Ben.
Why Romeo art thou mad?
Rom.
Not mad, but bound more then a mad man is:


Shut vp in prison, kept without my foode,


Whipt and tormented: and Godden good fellow,


  Ser.
Godgigoden, I pray sir can you read?
Rom.
I mine owne fortune in my miserie


   Ser.
Perhaps you haue learn'd it without booke:


But I pray can you read any thing you see?
Rom.
I, if I know the Letters and the Language


   Ser.
Ye say honestly, rest you merry
   Rom.
Stay fellow, I can read.
He reades the Letter.
Seigneur Martino, and his wife and daughter: County Anselme
and his beautious sisters: the Lady widdow of Vtruuio,
Seigneur Placentio, and his louely Neeces: Mercutio and
his brother Valentine: mine vncle Capulet his wife and daughters:
my faire Neece Rosaline, Liuia, Seigneur Valentio, & his
Cosen Tybalt: Lucio and the liuely Helena.
A faire assembly, whither should they come?
Ser.
Vp
   Rom.
Whither?
to supper?
Ser.
To our house


   Rom.
Whose house?
Ser.
My Maisters


   Rom.
Indeed I should haue askt you that before
   Ser.
Now Ile tell you without asking.
My maister is


the great rich Capulet, and if you be not of the house of


Mountagues I pray come and crush a cup of wine.
Rest


you merry.
Enter.
Ben.
At this same auncient Feast of Capulets


Sups the faire Rosaline, whom thou so loues:


With all the admired Beauties of Verona,


Go thither and with vnattainted eye,


Compare her face with some that I shall show,


And I will make thee thinke thy Swan a Crow


   Rom.
When the deuout religion of mine eye


Maintaines such falshood, then turne teares to fire:


And these who often drown'd could neuer die,


Transparent Heretiques be burnt for liers.
One fairer then my loue: the all-seeing Sun


Nere saw her match, since first the world begun


   Ben.
Tut, you saw her faire, none else being by,


Herselfe poys'd with herselfe in either eye:


But in that Christall scales, let there be waid,


Your Ladies loue against some other Maid


That I will show you, shining at this Feast,


And she shew scant shell, well, that now shewes best


   Rom.
Ile goe along, no such sight to be showne,


But to reioyce in splendor of mine owne.
Enter Capulets Wife and Nurse.
Wife.
Nurse wher's my daughter?
call her forth to me
   Nurse.
Now by my Maidenhead, at twelue yeare old


I bad her come, what Lamb: what Ladi-bird, God forbid,


Where's this Girle?
what Iuliet?
Enter Iuliet


   Iuliet.
How now, who calls?
Nur.
Your Mother


   Iuliet.
Madam I am heere, what is your will?
Wife.
This is the matter: Nurse giue me leaue awhile, we
must talke in secret.
Nurse come backe againe, I haue remembred
me, thou'se heare our counsell.
Thou knowest
my daughter's of a prety age
   Nurse.
Faith I can tell her age vnto an houre
   Wife.
Shee's not fourteene
   Nurse.
Ile lay fourteene of my teeth,


And yet to my teene be it spoken,


I haue but foure, shee's not fourteene.
How long is it now to Lammas tide?
Wife.
A fortnight and odde dayes


   Nurse.
Euen or odde, of all daies in the yeare come
Lammas Eue at night shall she be fourteene.
Susan & she,
God rest all Christian soules, were of an age.
Well Susan
is with God, she was too good for me.
But as I said, on Lamas
Eue at night shall she be fourteene, that shall she marie,
I remember it well.
'Tis since the Earth-quake now
eleuen yeares, and she was wean'd I neuer shall forget it,
of all the daies of the yeare, vpon that day: for I had then
laid Worme-wood to my Dug sitting in the Sunne vnder
the Douehouse wall, my Lord and you were then at
Mantua, nay I doe beare a braine.
But as I said, when it
did tast the Worme-wood on the nipple of my Dugge,
and felt it bitter, pretty foole, to see it teachie, and fall out
with the Dugge, Shake quoth the Doue-house, 'twas no
neede I trow to bid mee trudge, and since that time it is
a eleuen yeares, for then she could stand alone, nay bi'th'
roode she could haue runne, & wadled all about: for euen
the day before she broke her brow, & then my Husband
God be with his soule, a was a merrie man, tooke vp the
Child, yea quoth hee, doest thou fall vpon thy face?
thou
wilt fall backeward when thou hast more wit, wilt thou
not Iule?
And by my holy-dam, the pretty wretch lefte
crying, & said I: to see now how a Iest shall come about.
I warrant, & I shall liue a thousand yeares, I neuer should
forget it: wilt thou not Iule quoth he?
and pretty foole it
stinted, and said I
   Old La.
Inough of this, I pray thee hold thy peace
   Nurse.
Yes Madam, yet I cannot chuse but laugh, to
thinke it should leaue crying, & say I: and yet I warrant
it had vpon it brow, a bumpe as big as a young Cockrels
stone?
A perilous knock, and it cryed bitterly.
Yea quoth
my husband, fall'st vpon thy face, thou wilt fall backward
when thou commest to age: wilt thou not Iule?
It
stinted: and said I
   Iule.
And stint thou too, I pray thee Nurse, say I
   Nur.
Peace I haue done: God marke thee too his grace
thou wast the prettiest Babe that ere I nurst, and I might
liue to see thee married once, I haue my wish
   Old La.
Marry that marry is the very theame


I came to talke of, tell me daughter Iuliet,


How stands your disposition to be Married?
Iuli.
It is an houre that I dreame not of


   Nur.
An houre, were I not thine onely Nurse, I would


say thou had'st suckt wisedome from thy teat


   Old La.
Well thinke of marriage now, yonger then you


Heere in Verona, Ladies of esteeme,


Are made already Mothers.
By my count


I was your Mother, much vpon these yeares


That you are now a Maide, thus then in briefe:


The valiant Paris seekes you for his loue


   Nurse.
A man young Lady, Lady, such a man as all


the world.
Why hee's a man of waxe


   Old La.
Veronas Summer hath not such a flower
   Nurse.
Nay hee's a flower, infaith a very flower
   Old La.
What say you, can you loue the Gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our Feast,


Read ore the volume of young Paris face,


And find delight, writ there with Beauties pen:


Examine euery seuerall liniament,


And see how one another lends content:


And what obscur'd in this faire volume lies,


Find written in the Margent of his eyes.
This precious Booke of Loue, this vnbound Louer,


To Beautifie him, onely lacks a Couer.
The fish liues in the Sea, and 'tis much pride


For faire without, the faire within to hide:


That Booke in manies eyes doth share the glorie,


That in Gold claspes, Lockes in the Golden storie:


So shall you share all that he doth possesse,


By hauing him, making your selfe no lesse


   Nurse.
No lesse, nay bigger: women grow by men
   Old La.
Speake briefly, can you like of Paris loue?
Iuli.
Ile looke to like, if looking liking moue.
But no more deepe will I endart mine eye,


Then your consent giues strength to make flye.
Enter a Seruing man.
Ser.
Madam, the guests are come, supper seru'd vp, you
cal'd, my young Lady askt for, the Nurse cur'st in the Pantery,
and euery thing in extremitie: I must hence to wait, I
beseech you follow straight.
Enter.
Mo.
We follow thee, Iuliet, the Countie staies
   Nurse.
Goe Gyrle, seeke happie nights to happy daies.
Exeunt.
Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benuolio, with fiue or sixe other Maskers,


Torch-bearers.
Rom.
What shall this spech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without Apologie?
Ben.
The date is out of such prolixitie,


Weele haue no Cupid, hood winkt with a skarfe,


Bearing a Tartars painted Bow of lath,


Skaring the Ladies like a Crow-keeper.
But let them measure vs by what they will,


Weele measure them with a Measure, and be gone


   Rom.
Giue me a Torch, I am not for this ambling.
Being but heauy I will beare the light


   Mer.
Nay gentle Romeo, we must haue you dance
   Rom.
Not I beleeue me, you haue dancing shooes


With nimble soles, I haue a soale of Lead


So stakes me to the ground, I cannot moue


   Mer.
You are a Louer, borrow Cupids wings,


And soare with them aboue a common bound


   Rom.
I am too sore enpearced with his shaft,


To soare with his light feathers, and to bound:


I cannot bound a pitch aboue dull woe,


Vnder loues heauy burthen doe I sinke


   Hora.
And to sinke in it should you burthen loue,


Too great oppression for a tender thing


   Rom.
Is loue a tender thing?
it is too rough,


Too rude, too boysterous, and it pricks like thorne


   Mer.
If loue be rough with you, be rough with loue,


Pricke loue for pricking, and you beat loue downe,


Giue me a Case to put my visage in,


A Visor for a Visor, what care I


What curious eye doth quote deformities:


Here are the Beetle-browes shall blush for me


   Ben.
Come knocke and enter, and no sooner in,


But euery man betake him to his legs


   Rom.
A Torch for me, let wantons light of heart


Tickle the sencelesse rushes with their heeles:


For I am prouerb'd with a Grandsier Phrase,


Ile be a Candle-holder and looke on,


The game was nere so faire, and I am done


   Mer.
Tut, duns the Mouse, the Constables owne word,


If thou art dun, weele draw thee from the mire.
Or saue your reuerence loue, wherein thou stickest


Vp to the eares, come we burne day-light ho


   Rom.
Nay that's not so
   Mer.
I meane sir I delay,


We wast our lights in vaine, lights, lights, by day;


Take our good meaning, for our Iudgement sits


Fiue times in that, ere once in our fiue wits


   Rom.
And we meane well in going to this Maske,


But 'tis no wit to go


   Mer.
Why may one aske?
Rom.
I dreampt a dreame to night


   Mer.
And so did I
   Rom.
Well what was yours?
Mer.
That dreamers often lye


   Ro.
In bed a sleepe while they do dreame things true
   Mer.
O then I see Queene Mab hath beene with you:
She is the Fairies Midwife, & she comes in shape no bigger
then Agat-stone, on the fore-finger of an Alderman,
drawne with a teeme of little Atomies, ouer mens noses as
they lie asleepe: her Waggon Spokes made of long Spinners
legs: the Couer of the wings of Grashoppers, her
Traces of the smallest Spiders web, her coullers of the
Moonshines watry Beames, her Whip of Crickets bone,
the Lash of Philome, her Waggoner, a small gray-coated
Gnat, not halfe so bigge as a round little Worme, prickt
from the Lazie-finger of a man.
Her Chariot is an emptie
Haselnut, made by the Ioyner Squirrel or old Grub, time
out a mind, the Faries Coach-makers: & in this state she
gallops night by night, through Louers braines: and then
they dreame of Loue.
On Courtiers knees, that dreame on
Cursies strait: ore Lawyers fingers, who strait dreampt on
Fees, ore Ladies lips, who strait on kisses dreame, which
oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, because their
breath with Sweet meats tainted are.
Sometime she gallops
ore a Courtiers nose, & then dreames he of smelling
out a sute: & somtime comes she with Tith pigs tale, tickling
a Parsons nose as a lies asleepe, then he dreames of
another Benefice.
Sometime she driueth ore a Souldiers
necke, & then dreames he of cutting Forraine throats, of
Breaches, Ambuscados, Spanish Blades: Of Healths fiue
Fadome deepe, and then anon drums in his eares, at which
he startes and wakes; and being thus frighted, sweares a
prayer or two & sleepes againe: this is that very Mab that
plats the manes of Horses in the night: & bakes the Elklocks
in foule sluttish haires, which once vntangled, much
misfortune bodes,
This is the hag, when Maides lie on their backs,
That presses them, and learnes them first to beare,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she
   Rom.
Peace, peace, Mercutio peace,


Thou talk'st of nothing


   Mer.
True, I talke of dreames:


Which are the children of an idle braine,


Begot of nothing, but vaine phantasie,


Which is as thin of substance as the ayre,


And more inconstant then the wind, who wooes


Euen now the frozen bosome of the North:


And being anger'd, puffes away from thence,


Turning his side to the dew dropping South


   Ben.
This wind you talke of blowes vs from our selues,


Supper is done, and we shall come too late


   Rom.
I feare too early, for my mind misgiues,


Some consequence yet hanging in the starres,


Shall bitterly begin his fearefull date


With this nights reuels, and expire the tearme


Of a despised life clos'd in my brest:


By some vile forfeit of vntimely death.
But he that hath the stirrage of my course,


Direct my sute: on lustie Gentlemen


   Ben.
Strike Drum.
They march about the Stage, and Seruingmen come forth with
their napkins.
Enter Seruant.
Ser.
Where's Potpan, that he helpes not to take away?
He shift a Trencher?
he scrape a Trencher?
1.
When good manners, shall lie in one or two mens


hands, and they vnwasht too, 'tis a foule thing


   Ser.
Away with the Ioynstooles, remoue the Courtcubbord,
looke to the Plate: good thou, saue mee a piece
of Marchpane, and as thou louest me, let the Porter let in
Susan Grindstone, and Nell, Anthonie and Potpan
   2.
I Boy readie
   Ser.
You are lookt for, and cal'd for, askt for, & sought


for, in the great Chamber


   1.
We cannot be here and there too, chearly Boyes,


Be brisk awhile, and the longer liuer take all.
Exeunt.
Enter all the Guests and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.
1.
Capu.
Welcome Gentlemen,


Ladies that haue their toes


Vnplagu'd with Cornes, will walke about with you:


Ah my Mistresses, which of you all


Will now deny to dance?
She that makes dainty,


She Ile sweare hath Cornes: am I come neare ye now?
Welcome Gentlemen, I haue seene the day


That I haue worne a Visor, and could tell


A whispering tale in a faire Ladies eare:


Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone,


You are welcome Gentlemen, come Musitians play:


Musicke plaies: and they dance.
A Hall, Hall, giue roome, and foote it Girles,


More light you knaues, and turne the Tables vp:


And quench the fire, the Roome is growne too hot.
Ah sirrah, this vnlookt for sport comes well:


Nay sit, nay sit, good Cozin Capulet,


For you and I are past our dauncing daies:


How long 'ist now since last your selfe and I


Were in a Maske?
2.
Capu.
Berlady thirty yeares


   1.
Capu.
What man: 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much,


'Tis since the Nuptiall of Lucentio,


Come Pentycost as quickely as it will,


Some fiue and twenty yeares, and then we Maskt


   2.
Cap.
'Tis more, 'tis more, his Sonne is elder sir:


His Sonne is thirty


   3.
Cap.
Will you tell me that?
His Sonne was but a Ward two yeares agoe


   Rom.
What Ladie is that which doth inrich the hand


Of yonder Knight?
Ser.
I know not sir


   Rom.
O she doth teach the Torches to burne bright:


It seemes she hangs vpon the cheeke of night,


As a rich Iewel in an aethiops eare:


Beauty too rich for vse, for earth too deare:


So shewes a Snowy Doue trooping with Crowes,


As yonder Lady ore her fellowes showes;


The measure done, Ile watch her place of stand,


And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart loue till now, forsweare it sight,


For I neuer saw true Beauty till this night


   Tib.
This by his voice, should be a Mountague.
Fetch me my Rapier Boy, what dares the slaue


Come hither couer'd with an antique face,


To fleere and scorne at our Solemnitie?
Now by the stocke and Honour of my kin,


To strike him dead I hold it not a sin


   Cap.
Why how now kinsman,


Wherefore storme you so?
Tib.
Vncle this is a Mountague, our foe:


A Villaine that is hither come in spight,


To scorne at our Solemnitie this night


   Cap.
Young Romeo is it?
Tib.
'Tis he, that Villaine Romeo


   Cap.
Content thee gentle Coz, let him alone,


A beares him like a portly Gentleman:


And to say truth, Verona brags of him,


To be a vertuous and well gouern'd youth:


I would not for the wealth of all the towne,


Here in my house do him disparagement:


Therfore be patient, take no note of him,


It is my will, the which if thou respect,


Shew a faire presence, and put off these frownes,


An ill beseeming semblance for a Feast


  Tib.
It fits when such a Villaine is a guest,


Ile not endure him


   Cap.
He shall be endur'd.
What goodman boy, I say he shall, go too,


Am I the Maister here or you?
go too,


Youle not endure him, God shall mend my soule,


Youle make a Mutinie among the Guests:


You will set cocke a hoope, youle be the man


   Tib.
Why Vncle, 'tis a shame
   Cap.
Go too, go too,


You are a sawcy Boy, 'ist so indeed?
This tricke may chance to scath you, I know what,


You must contrary me, marry 'tis time.
Well said my hearts, you are a Princox, goe,


Be quiet, or more light, more light for shame,


Ile make you quiet.
What, chearely my hearts


   Tib.
Patience perforce, with wilfull choler meeting,


Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting:


I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall


Now seeming sweet, conuert to bitter gall.
Enter.
Rom.
If I prophane with my vnworthiest hand,


This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,


My lips to blushing Pilgrims did ready stand,


To smooth that rough touch, with a tender kisse


   Iul.
Good Pilgrime,


You do wrong your hand too much.
Which mannerly deuotion shewes in this,


For Saints haue hands, that Pilgrims hands do tuch,


And palme to palme, is holy Palmers kisse


   Rom.
Haue not Saints lips, and holy Palmers too?
Iul.
I Pilgrim, lips that they must vse in prayer


   Rom.
O then deare Saint, let lips do what hands do,


They pray (grant thou) least faith turne to dispaire


   Iul.
Saints do not moue,


Though grant for prayers sake


   Rom.
Then moue not while my prayers effect I take:


Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd


   Iul.
Then haue my lips the sin that they haue tooke
   Rom.
Sin from my lips?
O trespasse sweetly vrg'd:


Giue me my sin againe


   Iul.
You kisse by'th' booke
   Nur.
Madam your Mother craues a word with you
   Rom.
What is her Mother?
Nurs.
Marrie Batcheler,


Her Mother is the Lady of the house,


And a good Lady, and a wise, and Vertuous,


I Nur'st her Daughter that you talkt withall:


I tell you, he that can lay hold of her,


Shall haue the chincks


   Rom.
Is she a Capulet?
O deare account!
My life is my foes debt


   Ben.
Away, be gone, the sport is at the best
   Rom.
I so I feare, the more is my vnrest
   Cap.
Nay Gentlemen prepare not to be gone,


We haue a trifling foolish Banquet towards:


Is it e'ne so?
why then I thanke you all.
I thanke you honest Gentlemen, good night:


More Torches here: come on, then let's to bed.
Ah sirrah, by my faie it waxes late,


Ile to my rest


   Iuli.
Come hither Nurse,


What is yond Gentleman:


  Nur.
The Sonne and Heire of old Tyberio


   Iuli.
What's he that now is going out of doore?
Nur.
Marrie that I thinke be young Petruchio


   Iul.
What's he that follows here that would not dance?
Nur.
I know not


   Iul.
Go aske his name: if he be married,


My graue is like to be my wedded bed


   Nur.
His name is Romeo, and a Mountague,


The onely Sonne of your great Enemie


   Iul.
My onely Loue sprung from my onely hate,


Too early seene, vnknowne, and knowne too late,


Prodigious birth of Loue it is to me,


That I must loue a loathed Enemie


   Nur.
What's this?
whats this?
Iul.
A rime, I learne euen now


Of one I dan'st withall.
One cals within, Iuliet.
Nur.
Anon, anon:


Come let's away, the strangers all are gone.
Exeunt.
Chorus.
Now old desire doth in his death bed lie,


And yong affection gapes to be his Heire,


That faire, for which Loue gron'd for and would die,


With tender Iuliet matcht, is now not faire.
Now Romeo is beloued, and Loues againe,


A like bewitched by the charme of lookes:


But to his foe suppos'd he must complaine,


And she steale Loues sweet bait from fearefull hookes:


Being held a foe, he may not haue accesse


To breath such vowes as Louers vse to sweare,


And she as much in Loue, her meanes much lesse,


To meete her new Beloued any where:


But passion lends them Power, time, meanes to meete,


Temp'ring extremities with extreame sweete.
Enter Romeo alone.
Rom.
Can I goe forward when my heart is here?
Turne backe dull earth, and find thy Center out.
Enter Benuolio, with Mercutio.
Ben.
Romeo, my Cozen Romeo, Romeo
   Merc.
He is wise,


And on my life hath stolne him home to bed


   Ben.
He ran this way and leapt this Orchard wall.
Call good Mercutio:


Nay, Ile coniure too


   Mer.
Romeo, Humours, Madman, Passion, Louer,


Appeare thou in the likenesse of a sigh,


Speake but one time, and I am satisfied:


Cry me but ay me, Prouant, but Loue and day,


Speake to my goship Venus one faire word,


One Nickname for her purblind Sonne and her,


Young Abraham Cupid he that shot so true,


When King Cophetua lou'd the begger Maid,


He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moueth not,


The Ape is dead, I must coniure him,


I coniure thee by Rosalines bright eyes,


By her High forehead, and her Scarlet lip,


By her Fine foote, Straight leg, and Quiuering thigh,


And the Demeanes, that there Adiacent lie,


That in thy likenesse thou appeare to vs


   Ben.
And if he heare thee thou wilt anger him
   Mer.
This cannot anger him, t'would anger him


To raise a spirit in his Mistresse circle,


Of some strange nature, letting it stand


Till she had laid it, and coniured it downe,


That were some spight.
My inuocation is faire and honest, & in his Mistris name,


I coniure onely but to raise vp him


   Ben.
Come, he hath hid himselfe among these Trees


To be consorted with the Humerous night:


Blind is his Loue, and best befits the darke


   Mer.
If Loue be blind, Loue cannot hit the marke,


Now will he sit vnder a Medler tree,


And wish his Mistresse were that kind of Fruite,


As Maides cal Medlers when they laugh alone,


O Romeo that she were, O that she were


An open, or thou a Poprin Peare,


Romeo goodnight, Ile to my Truckle bed,


This Field-bed is to cold for me to sleepe,


Come shall we go?
Ben.
Go then, for 'tis in vaine to seeke him here


That meanes not to be found.
Exeunt.
Rom.
He ieasts at Scarres that neuer felt a wound,


But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the East, and Iuliet is the Sunne,


Arise faire Sun and kill the enuious Moone,


Who is already sicke and pale with griefe,


That thou her Maid art far more faire then she:


Be not her Maid since she is enuious,


Her Vestal liuery is but sicke and greene,


And none but fooles do weare it, cast it off:


It is my Lady, O it is my Loue, O that she knew she were,


She speakes, yet she sayes nothing, what of that?
Her eye discourses, I will answere it:


I am too bold 'tis not to me she speakes:


Two of the fairest starres in all the Heauen,


Hauing some businesse do entreat her eyes,


To twinckle in their Spheres till they returne.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head,


The brightnesse of her cheeke would shame those starres,


As day-light doth a Lampe, her eye in heauen,


Would through the ayrie Region streame so bright,


That Birds would sing, and thinke it were not night:


See how she leanes her cheeke vpon her hand.
O that I were a Gloue vpon that hand,


That I might touch that cheeke


   Iul.
Ay me
   Rom.
She speakes.
Oh speake againe bright Angell, for thou art


As glorious to this night being ore my head,


As is a winged messenger of heauen


Vnto the white vpturned wondring eyes


Of mortalls that fall backe to gaze on him,


When he bestrides the lazie puffing Cloudes,


And sailes vpon the bosome of the ayre


   Iul.
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Denie thy Father and refuse thy name:


Or if thou wilt not, be but sworne to my Loue,


And Ile no longer be a Capulet


   Rom.
Shall I heare more, or shall I speake at this?
Iu.
'Tis but thy name that is my Enemy:


Thou art thy selfe, though not a Mountague,


What's Mountague?
it is nor hand nor foote,


Nor arme, nor face, O be some other name


Belonging to a man.
What?
in a names that which we call a Rose,


By any other word would smell as sweete,


So Romeo would, were he not Romeo cal'd,


Retaine that deare perfection which he owes,


Without that title Romeo, doffe thy name,


And for thy name which is no part of thee,


Take all my selfe


   Rom.
I take thee at thy word:


Call me but Loue, and Ile be new baptiz'd,


Hence foorth I neuer will be Romeo


   Iuli.
What man art thou, that thus bescreen'd in night


So stumblest on my counsell?
Rom.
By a name,


I know not how to tell thee who I am:


My name deare Saint, is hatefull to my selfe,


Because it is an Enemy to thee,


Had I it written, I would teare the word


   Iuli.
My eares haue yet not drunke a hundred words


Of thy tongues vttering, yet I know the sound.
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
Rom.
Neither faire Maid, if either thee dislike


   Iul.
How cam'st thou hither.
Tell me, and wherefore?
The Orchard walls are high, and hard to climbe,


And the place death, considering who thou art,


If any of my kinsmen find thee here,


  Rom.
With Loues light wings


Did I ore-perch these Walls,


For stony limits cannot hold Loue out,


And what Loue can do, that dares Loue attempt:


Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me


   Iul.
If they do see thee, they will murther thee
   Rom.
Alacke there lies more perill in thine eye,


Then twenty of their Swords, looke thou but sweete,


And I am proofe against their enmity


   Iul.
I would not for the world they saw thee here
   Rom.
I haue nights cloake to hide me from their eyes


And but thou loue me, let them finde me here,


My life were better ended by their hate,


Then death proroged wanting of thy Loue


   Iul.
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
Rom.
By Loue that first did prompt me to enquire,


He lent me counsell, and I lent him eyes,


I am no Pylot, yet wert thou as far


As that vast-shore-washet with the farthest Sea,


I should aduenture for such Marchandise


   Iul.
Thou knowest the maske of night is on my face,


Else would a Maiden blush bepaint my cheeke,


For that which thou hast heard me speake to night,


Faine would I dwell on forme, faine, faine, denie


What I haue spoke, but farewell Complement,


Doest thou Loue?
I know thou wilt say I,


And I will take thy word, yet if thou swear'st,


Thou maiest proue false: at Louers periuries


They say Ioue laught, oh gentle Romeo,


If thou dost Loue, pronounce it faithfully:


Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly wonne,


Ile frowne and be peruerse, and say thee nay,


So thou wilt wooe: But else not for the world.
In truth faire Mountague I am too fond:


And therefore thou maiest thinke my behauiour light,


But trust me Gentleman, Ile proue more true,


Then those that haue coying to be strange,


I should haue beene more strange, I must confesse,


But that thou ouer heard'st ere I was ware


My true Loues passion, therefore pardon me,


And not impute this yeelding to light Loue,


Which the darke night hath so discouered


   Rom.
Lady, by yonder Moone I vow,


That tips with siluer all these Fruite tree tops


   Iul.
O sweare not by the Moone, th' inconstant Moone,


That monethly changes in her circled Orbe,


Least that thy Loue proue likewise variable


   Rom.
What shall I sweare by?
Iul.
Do not sweare at all:


Or if thou wilt sweare by thy gratious selfe,


Which is the God of my Idolatry,


And Ile beleeue thee


   Rom.
If my hearts deare loue
   Iuli.
Well do not sweare, although I ioy in thee:


I haue no ioy of this contract to night,


It is too rash, too vnaduis'd, too sudden,


Too like the lightning which doth cease to be


Ere, one can say, it lightens, Sweete good night:


This bud of Loue by Summers ripening breath,


May proue a beautious Flower when next we meete:


Goodnight, goodnight, as sweete repose and rest,


Come to thy heart, as that within my brest


   Rom.
O wilt thou leaue me so vnsatisfied?
Iuli.
What satisfaction can'st thou haue to night?
Ro.
Th' exchange of thy Loues faithfull vow for mine


   Iul.
I gaue thee mine before thou did'st request it:


And yet I would it were to giue againe


   Rom.
Would'st thou withdraw it,


For what purpose Loue?
Iul.
But to be franke and giue it thee againe,


And yet I wish but for the thing I haue,


My bounty is as boundlesse as the Sea,


My Loue as deepe, the more I giue to thee


The more I haue, for both are Infinite:


I heare some noyse within deare Loue adue:


Cals within.
Anon good Nurse, sweet Mountague be true:


Stay but a little, I will come againe


   Rom.
O blessed blessed night, I am afear'd


Being in night, all this is but a dreame,


Too flattering sweet to be substantiall


   Iul.
Three words deare Romeo,


And goodnight indeed,


If that thy bent of Loue be Honourable,


Thy purpose marriage, send me word to morrow,


By one that Ile procure to come to thee,


Where and what time thou wilt performe the right,


And all my Fortunes at thy foote Ile lay,


And follow thee my Lord throughout the world


   Within: Madam.
I come, anon: but if thou meanest not well,


I do beseech thee


  Within: Madam.
(By and by I come)


To cease thy strife, and leaue me to my griefe,


To morrow will I send


   Rom.
So thriue my soule
   Iu.
A thousand times goodnight.
Enter.
Rome.
A thousand times the worse to want thy light,


Loue goes toward Loue as school-boyes fro[m] their books


But Loue fro[m] Loue, towards schoole with heauie lookes.
Enter Iuliet againe.
Iul.
Hist Romeo hist: O for a Falkners voice,


To lure this Tassell gentle backe againe,


Bondage is hoarse, and may not speake aloud,


Else would I teare the Caue where Eccho lies,


And make her ayrie tongue more hoarse, then


With repetition of my Romeo


   Rom.
It is my soule that calls vpon my name.
How siluer sweet, sound Louers tongues by night,


Like softest Musicke to attending eares


   Iul.
Romeo
   Rom.
My Neece
   Iul.
What a clock to morrow


Shall I send to thee?
Rom.
By the houre of nine


   Iul.
I will not faile, 'tis twenty yeares till then,


I haue forgot why I did call thee backe


   Rom.
Let me stand here till thou remember it
   Iul.
I shall forget, to haue thee still stand there,


Remembring how I Loue thy company


   Rom.
And Ile still stay, to haue thee still forget,


Forgetting any other home but this


   Iul.
'Tis almost morning, I would haue thee gone,


And yet no further then a wantons Bird,


That let's it hop a little from his hand,


Like a poore prisoner in his twisted Gyues,


And with a silken thred plucks it backe againe,


So louing Iealous of his liberty


   Rom.
I would I were thy Bird
   Iul.
Sweet so would I,


Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing:


Good night, good night


   Rom.
Parting is such sweete sorrow,


That I shall say goodnight, till it be morrow


   Iul.
Sleepe dwell vpon thine eyes, peace in thy brest
   Rom.
Would I were sleepe and peace so sweet to rest,


The gray ey'd morne smiles on the frowning night,


Checkring the Easterne Clouds with streakes of light,


And darkenesse fleckel'd like a drunkard reeles,


From forth dayes pathway, made by Titans wheeles.
Hence will I to my ghostly Friers close Cell,


His helpe to craue, and my deare hap to tell.
Enter.
Enter Frier alone with a basket.
Fri.
The gray ey'd morne smiles on the frowning night,


Checkring the Easterne Cloudes with streaks of light:


And fleckled darknesse like a drunkard reeles,


From forth daies path, and Titans burning wheeles:


Now ere the Sun aduance his burning eye,


The day to cheere, and nights danke dew to dry,


I must vpfill this Osier Cage of ours,


With balefull weedes, and precious Iuiced flowers,


The earth that's Natures mother, is her Tombe,


What is her burying graue that is her wombe:


And from her wombe children of diuers kind


We sucking on her naturall bosome find:


Many for many vertues excellent:


None but for some, and yet all different.
O mickle is the powerfull grace that lies


In Plants, Hearbs, stones, and their true qualities:


For nought so vile, that on earth doth liue,


But to the earth some speciall good doth giue.
Nor ought so good, but strain'd from that faire vse,


Reuolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
Vertue it selfe turnes vice being misapplied,


And vice sometime by action dignified.
Enter Romeo.
Within the infant rind of this weake flower,


Poyson hath residence, and medicine power:


For this being smelt, with that part cheares each part,


Being tasted stayes all sences with the heart.
Two such opposed Kings encampe them still,


In man as well as Hearbes, grace and rude will:


And where the worser is predominant,


Full soone the Canker death eates vp that Plant


   Rom.
Good morrow Father
   Fri. Benedecite.
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young Sonne, it argues a distempered head,


So soone to bid goodmorrow to thy bed;


Care keepes his watch in euery old mans eye,


And where Care lodges, sleepe will neuer lye:


But where vnbrused youth with vnstuft braine


Doth couch his lims, there, golden sleepe doth raigne;


Therefore thy earlinesse doth me assure,


Thou art vprous'd with some distemprature;


Or if not so, then here I hit it right.
Our Romeo hath not beene in bed to night


   Rom.
That last is true, the sweeter rest was mine
   Fri. God pardon sin: wast thou with Rosaline?
Rom.
With Rosaline, my ghostly Father?
No,


I haue forgot that name, and that names woe


   Fri. That's my good Son, but wher hast thou bin then?
Rom.
Ile tell thee ere thou aske it me agen:


I haue beene feasting with mine enemie,


Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,


That's by me wounded: both our remedies


Within thy helpe and holy phisicke lies:


I beare no hatred, blessed man: for loe


My intercession likewise steads my foe


   Fri. Be plaine good Son, rest homely in thy drift,


Ridling confession, findes but ridling shrift


   Rom.
Then plainly know my hearts deare Loue is set,


On the faire daughter of rich Capulet:


As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;


And all combin'd, saue what thou must combine


By holy marriage: when and where, and how,


We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow:


Ile tell thee as we passe, but this I pray,


That thou consent to marrie vs to day


   Fri. Holy S[aint].
Francis, what a change is heere?
Is Rosaline that thou didst Loue so deare


So soone forsaken?
young mens Loue then lies


Not truely in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Iesu Maria, what a deale of brine


Hath washt thy sallow cheekes for Rosaline?
How much salt water throwne away in wast,


To season Loue that of it doth not tast.
The Sun not yet thy sighes, from heauen cleares,


Thy old grones yet ringing in my auncient eares:


Lo here vpon thy cheeke the staine doth sit,


Of an old teare that is not washt off yet.
If ere thou wast thy selfe, and these woes thine,


Thou and these woes, were all for Rosaline.
And art thou chang'd?
pronounce this sentence then,


Women may fall, when there's no strength in men


   Rom.
Thou chid'st me oft for louing Rosaline
   Fri. For doting, not for louing pupill mine
   Rom.
And bad'st me bury Loue
   Fri. Not in a graue,


To lay one in, another out to haue


   Rom.
I pray thee chide me not, her I Loue now


Doth grace for grace, and Loue for Loue allow:


The other did not so


   Fri. O she knew well,


Thy Loue did read by rote, that could not spell:


But come young wauerer, come goe with me,


In one respect, Ile thy assistant be:


For this alliance may so happy proue,


To turne your houshould rancor to pure Loue


   Rom.
O let vs hence, I stand on sudden hast
   Fri.
Wisely and slow, they stumble that run fast.
Exeunt.
Enter Benuolio and Mercutio.
Mer.
Where the deule should this Romeo be?
came he


not home to night?
Ben.
Not to his Fathers, I spoke with his man


   Mer.
Why that same pale hard-harted wench, that Rosaline


torments him so, that he will sure run mad


   Ben.
Tibalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a Letter


to his Fathers house


   Mer.
A challenge on my life
   Ben.
Romeo will answere it
   Mer.
Any man that can write, may answere a Letter
   Ben.
Nay, he will answere the Letters Maister how he
dares, being dared
   Mer.
Alas poore Romeo, he is already dead stab'd with
a white wenches blacke eye, runne through the eare with
a Loue song, the very pinne of his heart, cleft with the
blind Bowe-boyes but-shaft, and is he a man to encounter
Tybalt?
Ben.
Why what is Tibalt?
Mer.
More then Prince of Cats.
Oh hee's the Couragious
Captaine of Complements: he fights as you sing
pricksong, keeps time, distance, and proportion, he rests
his minum, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very
butcher of a silk button, a Dualist, a Dualist: a Gentleman
of the very first house of the first and second cause: ah the
immortall Passado, the Punto reuerso, the Hay
   Ben.
The what?
Mer.
The Pox of such antique lisping affecting phantacies,
these new tuners of accent: Iesu a very good blade,
a very tall man, a very good whore.
Why is not this a lamentable
thing Grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted
with these strange flies: these fashion Mongers, these
pardon-mee's,
who stand so much on the new form, that they
cannot sit at ease on the old bench.
O their bones, their
bones.
Enter Romeo.
Ben.
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo
   Mer.
Without his Roe, like a dryed Hering.
O flesh,
flesh, how art thou fishified?
Now is he for the numbers
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his Lady, was a kitchen
wench, marrie she had a better Loue to berime her: Dido
a dowdie, Cleopatra a Gipsie, Hellen and Hero, hildings
and Harlots: Thisbie a gray eie or so, but not to the purpose.
Signior Romeo, Bon iour, there's a French salutation to your
French slop: you gaue vs the counterfait fairely last
night
   Romeo.
Good morrow to you both, what counterfeit


did I giue you?
Mer.
The slip sir, the slip, can you not conceiue?
Rom.
Pardon Mercutio, my businesse was great, and in


such a case as mine, a man may straine curtesie


   Mer.
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains


a man to bow in the hams


   Rom.
Meaning to cursie
   Mer.
Thou hast most kindly hit it
   Rom.
A most curteous exposition
   Mer.
Nay, I am the very pinck of curtesie
   Rom.
Pinke for flower
   Mer.
Right
   Rom.
Why then is my Pump well flowr'd
   Mer.
Sure wit, follow me this ieast, now till thou hast
worne out thy Pump, that when the single sole of it is
worne, the ieast may remaine after the wearing, sole-singular
   Rom.
O single sol'd ieast,


Soly singular for the singlenesse


   Mer.
Come betweene vs good Benuolio, my wits faints
   Rom.
Swits and spurs,


Swits and spurs, or Ile crie a match


   Mer.
Nay, if our wits run the Wild-Goose chase, I am
done: For thou hast more of the Wild-Goose in one of
thy wits, then I am sure I haue in my whole fiue.
Was I
with you there for the Goose?
Rom.
Thou wast neuer with mee for any thing, when
thou wast not there for the Goose
   Mer.
I will bite thee by the eare for that iest
   Rom.
Nay, good Goose bite not
   Mer.
Thy wit is a very Bitter-sweeting,


It is a most sharpe sawce


   Rom.
And is it not well seru'd into a Sweet-Goose?
Mer.
Oh here's a wit of Cheuerell, that stretches from


an ynch narrow, to an ell broad


   Rom.
I stretch it out for that word, broad, which added


to the Goose, proues thee farre and wide, abroad Goose


   Mer.
Why is not this better now, then groning for
Loue, now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo: now art
thou what thou art, by Art as well as by Nature, for this
driueling Loue is like a great Naturall, that runs lolling
vp and downe to hid his bable in a hole
   Ben.
Stop there, stop there
   Mer.
Thou desir'st me to stop in my tale against the haire
   Ben.
Thou would'st else haue made thy tale large
   Mer.
O thou art deceiu'd, I would haue made it short,
or I was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant
indeed to occupie the argument no longer.
Enter Nurse and her man.
Rom.
Here's a goodly geare.
A sayle, a sayle


   Mer.
Two, two: a Shirt and a Smocke
   Nur.
Peter?
Peter.
Anon


   Nur.
My Fan Peter?
Mer.
Good Peter to hide her face?
For her Fans the fairer face?
Nur.
God ye good morrow Gentlemen


   Mer.
God ye gooden faire Gentlewoman
   Nur.
Is it gooden?
Mer.
'Tis no lesse I tell you: for the bawdy hand of the


Dyall is now vpon the pricke of Noone


   Nur.
Out vpon you: what a man are you?
Rom.
One Gentlewoman,


That God hath made, himselfe to mar


   Nur.
By my troth it is said, for himselfe to, mar quatha:
Gentlemen, can any of you tel me where I may find
the young Romeo?
Romeo.
I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older
when you haue found him, then he was when you sought
him: I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse
   Nur.
You say well
   Mer.
Yea is the worst well,


Very well tooke: Ifaith, wisely, wisely


   Nur.
If you be he sir,


I desire some confidence with you?
Ben.
She will endite him to some Supper


   Mer.
A baud, a baud, a baud.
So ho
   Rom.
What hast thou found?
Mer.
No Hare sir, vnlesse a Hare sir in a Lenten pie,
that is something stale and hoare ere it be spent.
An old Hare hoare, and an old Hare hoare is very good
meat in Lent.
But a Hare that is hoare is too much for a score, when it
hoares ere it be spent,
Romeo will you come to your Fathers?
Weele to dinner
thither
   Rom.
I will follow you
   Mer.
Farewell auncient Lady:


Farewell Lady, Lady, Lady.
Exit.
Mercutio, Benuolio.
Nur.
I pray you sir, what sawcie Merchant was this
that was so full of his roperie?
Rom.
A Gentleman Nurse, that loues to heare himselfe
talke, and will speake more in a minute, then he will stand
to in a Moneth
   Nur.
And a speake any thing against me, Ile take him
downe, z a were lustier then he is, and twentie such Iacks:
and if I cannot, Ile finde those that shall: scuruie knaue, I
am none of his flurt-gils, I am none of his skaines mates,
and thou must stand by too and suffer euery knaue to vse
me at his pleasure
   Pet.
I saw no man vse you at his pleasure: if I had, my
weapon should quickly haue beene out, I warrant you, I
dare draw assoone as another man, if I see occasion in a
good quarrell, and the law on my side
   Nur.
Now afore God, I am so vext, that euery part about
me quiuers, skuruy knaue: pray you sir a word: and as I
told you, my young Lady bid me enquire you out, what
she bid me say, I will keepe to my selfe: but first let me
tell ye, if ye should leade her in a fooles paradise, as they
say, it were a very grosse kind of behauiour, as they say:
for the Gentlewoman is yong: & therefore, if you should
deale double with her, truely it were an ill thing to be offered
to any Gentlewoman, and very weake dealing
   Nur.
Nurse commend me to thy Lady and Mistresse, I


protest vnto thee


   Nur.
Good heart, and yfaith I will tell her as much:


Lord, Lord she will be a ioyfull woman


   Rom.
What wilt thou tell her Nurse?
thou doest not


marke me?
Nur.
I will tell her sir, that you do protest, which as I


take it, is a Gentleman-like offer


   Rom.
Bid her deuise some meanes to come to shrift this


afternoone,


And there she shall at Frier Lawrence Cell


Be shriu'd and married: here is for thy paines


   Nur.
No truly sir not a penny
   Rom.
Go too, I say you shall
   Nur.
This afternoone sir?
well she shall be there
   Ro.
And stay thou good Nurse behind the Abbey wall,


Within this houre my man shall be with thee,


And bring thee Cords made like a tackled staire,


Which to the high top gallant of my ioy,


Must be my conuoy in the secret night.
Farewell, be trustie and Ile quite thy paines:


Farewell, commend me to thy Mistresse


   Nur.
Now God in heauen blesse thee: harke you sir,


  Rom.
What saist thou my deare Nurse?
Nurse.
Is your man secret, did you nere heare say two


may keepe counsell putting one away


   Ro.
Warrant thee my man is true as steele
   Nur.
Well sir, my Mistresse is the sweetest Lady, Lord,
Lord, when 'twas a little prating thing.
O there is a Noble
man in Towne one Paris, that would faine lay knife aboard:
but she good soule had as leeue see a Toade, a very
Toade as see him: I anger her sometimes, and tell her that
Paris is the properer man, but Ile warrant you, when I say
so, shee lookes as pale as any clout in the versall world.
Doth not Rosemarie and Romeo begin both with a letter?
Rom.
I Nurse, what of that?
Both with an R
  Nur.
A mocker that's the dogs name.
R. is for the no,
I know it begins with some other letter, and she hath the
prettiest sententious of it, of you and Rosemary, that it
would do you good to heare it
   Rom.
Commend me to thy Lady
   Nur.
I a thousand times.
Peter?
Pet.
Anon


   Nur.
Before and apace.
Exit Nurse and Peter.
Enter Iuliet.
Iul.
The clocke strook nine, when I did send the Nurse,


In halfe an houre she promised to returne,


Perchance she cannot meete him: that's not so:


Oh she is lame, Loues Herauld should be thoughts,


Which ten times faster glides then the Sunnes beames,


Driuing backe shadowes ouer lowring hils.
Therefore do nimble Pinion'd Doues draw Loue,


And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings:


Now is the Sun vpon the highmost hill


Of this daies iourney, and from nine till twelue,


Is three long houres, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warme youthfull blood,


She would be as swift in motion as a ball,


My words would bandy her to my sweete Loue,


And his to me, but old folkes,


Many faine as they were dead,


Vnwieldie, slow, heauy, and pale as lead.
Enter Nurse.
O God she comes, O hony Nurse what newes?
Hast thou met with him?
send thy man away


   Nur.
Peter stay at the gate
   Iul.
Now good sweet Nurse:


O Lord, why lookest thou sad?
Though newes, be sad, yet tell them merrily.
If good thou sham'st the musicke of sweet newes,


By playing it to me, with so sower a face


   Nur.
I am a weary, giue me leaue awhile,


Fie how my bones ake, what a iaunt haue I had?
Iul.
I would thou had'st my bones, and I thy newes:


Nay come I pray thee speake, good good Nurse speake


   Nur.
Iesu what hast?
can you not stay a while?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Iul.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breth
To say to me, that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay,
Is longer then the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy newes good or bad?
answere to that,
Say either, and Ile stay the circumstance:
Let me be satisfied, ist good or bad?
Nur.
Well, you haue made a simple choice, you know
not how to chuse a man: Romeo, no not he though his face
be better then any mans, yet his legs excels all mens, and
for a hand, and a foote, and a body, though they be not to
be talkt on, yet they are past compare: he is not the flower
of curtesie, but Ile warrant him as gentle a Lambe: go thy
waies wench, serue God.
What haue you din'd at home?
Iul.
No no: but all this did I know before
What saies he of our marriage?
what of that?
Nur.
Lord how my head akes, what a head haue I?
It beates as it would fall in twenty peeces.
My backe a tother side: o my backe, my backe:
Beshrew your heart for sending me about
To catch my death with iaunting vp and downe
   Iul.
Ifaith: I am sorrie that thou art so well.
Sweet sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me what saies my Loue?
Nur.
Your Loue saies like an honest Gentleman,


And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,


And I warrant a vertuous: where is your Mother?
Iul.
Where is my Mother?
Why she is within, where should she be?
How odly thou repli'st:


Your Loue saies like an honest Gentleman:


Where is your Mother?
Nur.
O Gods Lady deare,


Are you so hot?
marrie come vp I trow,


Is this the Poultis for my aking bones?
Henceforward do your messages your selfe


   Iul.
Heere's such a coile, come what saies Romeo?
Nur.
Haue you got leaue to go to shift to day?
Iul.
I haue


   Nur.
Then high you hence to Frier Lawrence Cell,


There staies a Husband to make you a wife:


Now comes the wanton bloud vp in your cheekes,


Thei'le be in Scarlet straight at any newes:


Hie you to Church, I must an other way,


To fetch a Ladder by the which your Loue


Must climde a birds nest Soone when it is darke:


I am the drudge, and toile in your delight:


But you shall beare the burthen soone at night.
Go Ile to dinner, hie you to the Cell


   Iul.
Hie to high Fortune, honest Nurse, farewell.
Exeunt.
Enter Frier and Romeo.
Fri.
So smile the heauens vpon this holy act,


That after houres, with sorrow chide vs not


   Rom.
Amen, amen, but come what sorrow can,


It cannot counteruaile the exchange of ioy


That one short minute giues me in her sight:


Do thou but close our hands with holy words.
Then Loue-deuouring death do what he dare,


It is inough.
I may call her mine


   Fri.
These violent delights haue violent endes,


And in their triumph: die like fire and powder;


Which as they kisse consume.
The sweetest honey


Is loathsome in his owne deliciousnesse,


And in the taste confoundes the appetite.
Therefore Loue moderately, long Loue doth so,


Too swift arriues as tardie as too slow.
Enter Iuliet.
Here comes the Lady.
Oh so light a foot


Will nere weare out the euerlasting flint,


A Louer may bestride the Gossamours,


That ydles in the wanton Summer ayre,


And yet not fall, so light is vanitie


   Iul.
Good euen to my ghostly Confessor
   Fri. Romeo shall thanke thee Daughter for vs both
   Iul.
As much to him, else in his thanks too much
   Fri. Ah Iuliet, if the measure of thy ioy


Be heapt like mine, and that thy skill be more


To blason it, then sweeten with thy breath


This neighbour ayre, and let rich musickes tongue,


Vnfold the imagin'd happinesse that both


Receiue in either, by this deere encounter


   Iul.
Conceit more rich in matter then in words,


Brags of his substance, not of Ornament:


They are but beggers that can count their worth,


But my true Loue is growne to such excesse,


I cannot sum vp some of halfe my wealth


   Fri. Come, come with me, & we will make short worke,


For by your leaues, you shall not stay alone,


Till holy Church incorporate two in one.
Enter Mercutio, Benuolio, and men.
Ben.
I pray thee good Mercutio lets retire,


The day is hot, the Capulets abroad:


And if we meet, we shal not scape a brawle, for now these


hot dayes, is the mad blood stirring


   Mer.
Thou art like one of these fellowes, that when he
enters the confines of a Tauerne, claps me his Sword vpon
the Table, and sayes, God send me no need of thee: and by
the operation of the second cup, drawes him on the Drawer,
when indeed there is no need
   Ben.
Am I like such a Fellow?
Mer.
Come, come, thou art as hot a Iacke in thy mood,


as any in Italie: and assoone moued to be moodie, and assoone


moodie to be mou'd


   Ben.
And what too?
Mer.
Nay, and there were two such, we should haue
none shortly, for one would kill the other: thou, why thou
wilt quarrell with a man that hath a haire more, or a haire
lesse in his beard, then thou hast: thou wilt quarrell with a
man for cracking Nuts, hauing no other reason, but because
thou hast hasell eyes: what eye, but such an eye,
would spie out such a quarrell?
thy head is full of quarrels,
as an egge is full of meat, and yet thy head hath bin
beaten as addle as an egge for quarreling: thou hast quarrel'd
with a man for coffing in the street, because he hath
wakened thy Dog that hath laine asleepe in the Sun.
Did'st
thou not fall out with a Tailor for wearing his new Doublet
before Easter?
with another, for tying his new shooes
with old Riband, and yet thou wilt Tutor me from quarrelling?
Ben.
And I were so apt to quarell as thou art, any man
should buy the Fee-simple of my life, for an houre and a
quarter
   Mer.
The Fee-simple?
O simple.
Enter Tybalt, Petruchio, and others.
Ben.
By my head here comes the Capulets
   Mer.
By my heele I care not
   Tyb.
Follow me close, for I will speake to them.
Gentlemen, Good den, a word with one of you


   Mer.
And but one word with one of vs?
couple it with


something, make it a word and a blow


   Tib.
You shall find me apt inough to that sir, and you


will giue me occasion


   Mercu.
Could you not take some occasion without


giuing?
Tib.
Mercutio thou consort'st with Romeo


   Mer.
Consort?
what dost thou make vs Minstrels?
&
thou make Minstrels of vs, looke to heare nothing but discords:
heere's my fiddlesticke, heere's that shall make you
daunce.
Come consort
   Ben.
We talke here in the publike haunt of men,


Either withdraw vnto some priuate place,


Or reason coldly of your greeuances:


Or else depart, here all eies gaze on vs


   Mer.
Mens eyes were made to looke, and let them gaze.
I will not budge for no mans pleasure I.
Enter Romeo.
Tib.
Well peace be with you sir, here comes my man
   Mer.
But Ile be hang'd sir if he weare your Liuery.
Marry go before to field, heele be your follower,


Your worship in that sense, may call him man


   Tib.
Romeo, the loue I beare thee, can affoord


No better terme then this: Thou art a Villaine


   Rom.
Tibalt, the reason that I haue to loue thee,


Doth much excuse the appertaining rage


To such a greeting: Villaine am I none;


Therefore farewell, I see thou know'st me not


   Tib.
Boy, this shall not excuse the iniuries


That thou hast done me, therefore turne and draw


   Rom.
I do protest I neuer iniur'd thee,


But lou'd thee better then thou can'st deuise:


Till thou shalt know the reason of my loue,


And so good Capulet, which name I tender


As dearely as my owne, be satisfied


   Mer.
O calme, dishonourable, vile submission:
Alla stucatho carries it away.
Tybalt, you Rat-catcher, will you walke?
Tib.
What wouldst thou haue with me?
Mer.
Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine
liues, that I meane to make bold withall, and as you shall
vse me hereafter dry beate the rest of the eight.
Will you
pluck your Sword out of his Pilcher by the eares?
Make
hast, least mine be about your eares ere it be out
   Tib.
I am for you
   Rom.
Gentle Mercutio, put thy Rapier vp
   Mer.
Come sir, your Passado
   Rom.
Draw Benuolio, beat downe their weapons:


Gentlemen, for shame forbeare this outrage,


Tibalt, Mercutio, the Prince expresly hath


Forbidden bandying in Verona streetes.
Hold Tybalt, good Mercutio.
Exit Tybalt.
Mer.
I am hurt.
A plague a both the Houses, I am sped:


Is he gone and hath nothing?
Ben.
What art thou hurt?
Mer.
I, I, a scratch, a scratch, marry 'tis inough,


Where is my Page?
go Villaine fetch a Surgeon


   Rom.
Courage man, the hurt cannot be much
   Mer.
No: 'tis not so deepe as a well, nor so wide as a
Church doore, but 'tis inough, 'twill serue: aske for me to
morrow, and you shall find me a graue man.
I am pepper'd
I warrant, for this world: a plague a both your houses.
What, a Dog, a Rat, a Mouse, a Cat to scratch a man to
death: a Braggart, a Rogue, a Villaine, that fights by the
booke of Arithmeticke, why the deu'le came you betweene
vs?
I was hurt vnder your arme
   Rom.
I thought all for the best
   Mer.
Helpe me into some house Benuolio,


Or I shall faint: a plague a both your houses.
They haue made wormesmeat of me,


I haue it, and soundly to your Houses.
Enter.
Rom.
This Gentleman the Princes neere Alie,


My very Friend hath got his mortall hurt


In my behalfe, my reputation stain'd


With Tibalts slaunder, Tybalt that an houre


Hath beene my Cozin: O Sweet Iuliet,


Thy Beauty hath made me Effeminate,


And in my temper softned Valours steele.
Enter Benuolio.
Ben.
O Romeo, Romeo, braue Mercutio's is dead,


That Gallant spirit hath aspir'd the Cloudes,


Which too vntimely here did scorne the earth


   Rom.
This daies blacke Fate, on mo daies depend,


This but begins, the wo others must end.
Enter Tybalt.
Ben.
Here comes the Furious Tybalt backe againe
   Rom.
He gon in triumph, and Mercutio slaine?
Away to heauen respectiue Lenitie,


And fire and Fury, be my conduct now.
Now Tybalt take the Villaine backe againe


That late thou gau'st me, for Mercutios soule


Is but a little way aboue our heads,


Staying for thine to keepe him companie:


Either thou or I, or both, must goe with him


   Tib.
Thou wretched Boy that didst consort him here,


Shalt with him hence


   Rom.
This shall determine that.
They fight.
Tybalt falles.
Ben.
Romeo, away be gone:


The Citizens are vp, and Tybalt slaine,


Stand not amaz'd, the Prince will Doome thee death


If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away


   Rom.
O!
I am Fortunes foole
   Ben.
Why dost thou stay?
Exit Romeo.
Enter Citizens.
Citi.
Which way ran he that kild Mercutio?
Tibalt that Murtherer, which way ran he?
Ben.
There lies that Tybalt


   Citi.

Enter Prince, old Montague, Capulet, their Wiues and all.
Prin.
Where are the vile beginners of this Fray?

O Noble Prince, I can discouer all


The vnluckie Mannage of this fatall brall:


There lies the man slaine by young Romeo,


That slew thy kinsman braue Mercutio


   Cap.
Wi.
Tybalt, my Cozin?
O my Brothers Child,


O Prince, O Cozin, Husband, O the blood is spild


Of my deare kinsman.
Prince as thou art true,


For bloud of ours, shed bloud of Mountague.
O Cozin, Cozin


   Prin.
Benuolio, who began this Fray?
Ben.
Tybalt here slaine, whom Romeo's hand did slay,


Romeo that spoke him faire, bid him bethinke


How nice the Quarrell was, and vrg'd withall


Your high displeasure: all this vttered,


With gentle breath, calme looke, knees humbly bow'd


Could not take truce with the vnruly spleene


Of Tybalts deafe to peace, but that he Tilts


With Peircing steele at bold Mercutio's breast,


Who all as hot, turnes deadly point to point,


And with a Martiall scorne, with one hand beates


Cold death aside, and with the other sends


It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity


Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,


Hold Friends, Friends part, and swifter then his tongue,


His aged arme, beats downe their fatall points,


And twixt them rushes, vnderneath whose arme,


An enuious thrust from Tybalt, hit the life


Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.
But by and by comes backe to Romeo,


Who had but newly entertained Reuenge,


And too't they goe like lightning, for ere I


Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slaine:


And as he fell, did Romeo turne and flie:


This is the truth, or let Benuolio die


   Cap.
Wi.
He is a kinsman to the Mountague,


Affection makes him false, he speakes not true:


Some twenty of them fought in this blacke strife,


And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for Iustice, which thou Prince must giue:


Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not liue


   Prin.
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio,


Who now the price of his deare blood doth owe


   Cap.
Not Romeo Prince, he was Mercutios Friend,


His fault concludes, but what the law should end,


The life of Tybalt


   Prin.
And for that offence,


Immediately we doe exile him hence:


I haue an interest in your hearts proceeding:


My bloud for your rude brawles doth lie a bleeding.
But Ile Amerce you with so strong a fine,


That you shall all repent the losse of mine.
It will be deafe to pleading and excuses,


Nor teares, nor prayers shall purchase our abuses.
Therefore vse none, let Romeo hence in hast,


Else when he is found, that houre is his last.
Beare hence his body, and attend our will:


Mercy not Murders, pardoning those that kill.
Exeunt.
Enter Iuliet alone.
Iul.
Gallop apace, you fiery footed steedes,


Towards Phoebus lodging, such a Wagoner


As Phaeton would whip you to the west,


And bring in Cloudie night immediately.
Spred thy close Curtaine Loue-performing night,


That run-awayes eyes may wincke, and Romeo


Leape to these armes, vntalkt of and vnseene,


Louers can see to doe their Amorous rights,


And by their owne Beauties: or if Loue be blind,


It best agrees with night: come ciuill night,


Thou sober suted Matron all in blacke,


And learne me how to loose a winning match,


Plaid for a paire of stainlesse Maidenhoods,


Hood my vnman'd blood bayting in my Cheekes,


With thy Blacke mantle, till strange Loue grow bold,


Thinke true Loue acted simple modestie:


Come night, come Romeo, come thou day in night,


For thou wilt lie vpon the wings of night


Whiter then new Snow vpon a Rauens backe:


Come gentle night, come louing blackebrow'd night.
Giue me my Romeo, and when I shall die,


Take him and cut him out in little starres,


And he will make the Face of heauen so fine,


That all the world will be in Loue with night,


And pay no worship to the Garish Sun.
O I haue bought the Mansion of a Loue,


But not possest it, and though I am sold,


Not yet enioy'd, so tedious is this day,


As is the night before some Festiuall,


To an impatient child that hath new robes


And may not weare them, O here comes my Nurse:


Enter Nurse with cords.
And she brings newes and euery tongue that speaks


But Romeos name, speakes heauenly eloquence:


Now Nurse, what newes?
what hast thou there?
The Cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?
Nur.
I, I, the Cords


   Iuli.
Ay me, what newes?
Why dost thou wring thy hands


   Nur.
A weladay, hee's dead, hee's dead,


We are vndone Lady, we are vndone.
Alacke the day, hee's gone, hee's kil'd, he's dead


   Iul.
Can heauen be so enuious?
Nur.
Romeo can,


Though heauen cannot.
O Romeo, Romeo.
Who euer would haue thought it Romeo


   Iuli.
What diuell art thou,


That dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar'd in dismall hell,


Hath Romeo slaine himselfe?
say thou but I,


And that bare vowell I shall poyson more


Then the death-darting eye of Cockatrice,


I am not I, if there be such an I.
Or those eyes shot, that makes thee answere I:


If he be slaine say I, or if not, no.
Briefe, sounds, determine of my weale or wo


   Nur.
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,


God saue the marke, here on his manly brest,


A pitteous Coarse, a bloody piteous Coarse:


Pale, pale as ashes, all bedawb'd in blood,


All in gore blood I sounded at the sight


   Iul.
O breake my heart,


Poore Banckrout breake at once,


To prison eyes, nere looke on libertie.
Vile earth to earth resigne, end motion here,


And thou and Romeo presse on heauie beere


   Nur.
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best Friend I had:


O curteous Tybalt honest Gentleman,


That euer I should liue to see thee dead


   Iul.
What storme is this that blowes so contrarie?
Is Romeo slaughtred?
and is Tybalt dead?
My dearest Cozen, and my dearer Lord:


Then dreadfull Trumpet sound the generall doome,


For who is liuing, if those two are gone?
Nur.
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,


Romeo that kil'd him, he is banished


   Iul.
O God!
Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalts blood


It did, it did, alas the day, it did


   Nur.
O Serpent heart hid with a flowring face
   Iul.
Did euer Dragon keepe so faire a Caue?
Beautifull Tyrant, fiend Angelicall:


Rauenous Doue-feather'd Rauen,


Woluish-rauening Lambe,


Dispised substance of Diuinest show:


Iust opposite to what thou iustly seem'st,


A dimne Saint, an Honourable Villaine:


O Nature!
what had'st thou to doe in hell,


When thou did'st bower the spirit of a fiend


In mortall paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was euer booke containing such vile matter


So fairely bound?
O that deceit should dwell


In such a gorgeous Pallace


   Nur.
There's no trust, no faith, no honestie in men,


All periur'd, all forsworne, all naught, all dissemblers,


Ah where's my man?
giue me some Aqua-vitae?
These griefes, these woes, these sorrowes make me old:


Shame come to Romeo


   Iul.
Blister'd be thy tongue


For such a wish, he was not borne to shame:


Vpon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;


For 'tis a throane where Honour may be Crown'd


Sole Monarch of the vniuersall earth:


O what a beast was I to chide him?
Nur.
Will you speake well of him,


That kil'd your Cozen?
Iul.
Shall I speake ill of him that is my husband?
Ah poore my Lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,


When I thy three houres wife haue mangled it.
But wherefore Villaine did'st thou kill my Cozin?
That Villaine Cozin would haue kil'd my husband:


Backe foolish teares, backe to your natiue spring,


Your tributarie drops belong to woe,


Which you mistaking offer vp to ioy:


My husband liues that Tibalt would haue slaine,


And Tibalt dead that would haue slaine my husband:


All this is comfort, wherefore weepe I then?
Some words there was worser then Tybalts death


That murdered me, I would forget it feine,


But oh, it presses to my memory,


Like damned guilty deedes to sinners minds,


Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished:


That banished, that one word banished,


Hath slaine ten thousand Tibalts: Tibalts death


Was woe inough if it had ended there:


Or if sower woe delights in fellowship,


And needly will be rankt with other griefes,


Why followed not when she said Tibalts dead,


Thy Father or thy Mother, nay or both,


Which moderne lamentation might haue mou'd.
But which a rere-ward following Tybalts death


Romeo is banished to speake that word,


Is Father, Mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Iuliet,


All slaine, all dead: Romeo is banished,


There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,


In that words death, no words can that woe sound.
Where is my Father and my Mother Nurse?
Nur.
Weeping and wailing ouer Tybalts Coarse,


Will you go to them?
I will bring you thither


   Iu.
Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shal be spent


When theirs are drie for Romeo's banishment.
Take vp those Cordes, poore ropes you are beguil'd,


Both you and I for Romeo is exild:


He made you for a high-way to my bed,


But I a Maid, die Maiden widowed.
Come Cord, come Nurse, Ile to my wedding bed,


And death not Romeo, take my Maiden head


   Nur.
Hie to your Chamber, Ile find Romeo


To comfort you, I wot well where he is:


Harke ye your Romeo will be heere at night,


Ile to him, he is hid at Lawrence Cell


   Iul.
O find him, giue this Ring to my true Knight,


And bid him come, to take his last farewell.
Exit
Enter Frier and Romeo.
Fri. Romeo come forth,


Come forth thou fearfull man,


Affliction is enamor'd of thy parts


And thou art wedded to calamitie,


  Rom.
Father what newes?
What is the Princes Doome?
What sorrow craues acquaintance at my hand,


That I yet know not?
Fri. Too familiar


Is my deare Sonne with such sowre Company


I bring thee tydings of the Princes Doome


   Rom.
What lesse then Doomesday,


Is the Princes Doome?
Fri. A gentler iudgement vanisht from his lips,


Not bodies death, but bodies banishment


   Rom.
Ha, banishment?
be mercifull, say death:


For exile hath more terror in his looke,


Much more then death: do not say banishment


   Fri.
Here from Verona art thou banished:


Be patient, for the world is broad and wide


   Rom.
There is no world without Verona walles,


But Purgatorie, Torture, hell it selfe:


Hence banished, is banisht from the world,


And worlds exile is death.
Then banished,


Is death, mistearm'd, calling death banished,


Thou cut'st my head off with a golden Axe,


And smilest vpon the stroke that murders me


   Fri. O deadly sin, O rude vnthankefulnesse!
Thy falt our Law calles death, but the kind Prince


Taking thy part, hath rusht aside the Law,


And turn'd that blacke word death, to banishment.
This is deare mercy, and thou seest it not


   Rom.
'Tis Torture and not mercy, heauen is here


Where Iuliet liues, and euery Cat and Dog,


And little Mouse, euery vnworthy thing


Liue here in Heauen and may looke on her,


But Romeo may not.
More Validitie,


More Honourable state, more Courtship liues


In carrion Flies, then Romeo: they may seaze


On the white wonder of deare Iuliets hand,


And steale immortall blessing from her lips,


Who euen in pure and vestall modestie


Still blush, as thinking their owne kisses sin.
This may Flies doe, when I from this must flie,


And saist thou yet, that exile is not death?
But Romeo may not, hee is banished.
Had'st thou no poyson mixt, no sharpe ground knife,


No sudden meane of death, though nere so meane,


But banished to kill me?
Banished?
O Frier, the damned vse that word in hell:


Howlings attends it, how hast then the hart


Being a Diuine, a Ghostly Confessor,


A Sin-Absoluer, and my Friend profest:


To mangle me with that word, banished?
Fri. Then fond Mad man, heare me speake


   Rom.
O thou wilt speake againe of banishment
   Fri. Ile giue thee Armour to keepe off that word,


Aduersities sweete milke, Philosophie,


To comfort thee, though thou art banished


   Rom.
Yet banished?
hang vp Philosophie:


Vnlesse Philosophie can make a Iuliet,


Displant a Towne, reuerse a Princes Doome,


It helpes not, it preuailes not, talke no more


   Fri. O then I see, that Mad men haue no eares
   Rom.
How should they,


When wisemen haue no eyes?
Fri. Let me dispaire with thee of thy estate,


  Rom.
Thou can'st not speake of that y dost not feele,


Wert thou as young as Iuliet my Loue:


An houre but married, Tybalt murdered,


Doting like me, and like me banished,


Then mightest thou speake,


Then mightest thou teare thy hayre,


And fall vpon the ground as I doe now,


Taking the measure of an vnmade graue.
Enter Nurse, and knockes.
Frier.
Arise one knockes,


Good Romeo hide thy selfe


   Rom.
Not I,


Vnlesse the breath of Hartsicke groanes


Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.
Knocke
  Fri. Harke how they knocke:


(Who's there) Romeo arise,


Thou wilt be taken, stay a while, stand vp:


Knocke.
Run to my study: by and by, Gods will


What simplenesse is this: I come, I come.
Knocke.
Who knocks so hard?
Whence come you?
what's your will?
Enter Nurse.
Nur.
Let me come in,


And you shall know my errand:


I come from Lady Iuliet


   Fri.
Welcome then
   Nur.
O holy Frier, O tell me holy Frier,


Where's my Ladies Lord?
where's Romeo?
Fri.
There on the ground,


With his owne teares made drunke


   Nur.
O he is euen in my Mistresse case,


Iust in her case.
O wofull simpathy:


Pittious predicament, euen so lies she,


Blubbring and weeping, weeping and blubbring,


Stand vp, stand vp, stand and you be a man,


For Iuliets sake, for her sake rise and stand:


Why should you fall into so deepe an O


   Rom.
Nurse
   Nur.
Ah sir, ah sir, deaths the end of all
   Rom.
Speak'st thou of Iuliet?
how is it with her?
Doth not she thinke me an old Murtherer,


Now I haue stain'd the Childhood of our ioy,


With blood remoued, but little from her owne?
Where is she?
and how doth she?
and what sayes


My conceal'd Lady to our conceal'd Loue?
Nur.
Oh she sayes nothing sir, but weeps and weeps,


And now fals on her bed, and then starts vp,


And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,


And then downe falls againe


   Ro.
As if that name shot from the dead leuell of a Gun,


Did murder her, as that names cursed hand


Murdred her kinsman.
Oh tell me Frier, tell me,


In what vile part of this Anatomie


Doth my name lodge?
Tell me, that I may sacke


The hatefull Mansion


   Fri.
Hold thy desperate hand:


Art thou a man?
thy forme cries out thou art:


Thy teares are womanish, thy wild acts denote


The vnreasonable Furie of a beast.
Vnseemely woman, in a seeming man,


And ill beseeming beast in seeming both,


Thou hast amaz'd me.
By my holy order,


I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
Hast thou slaine Tybalt?
wilt thou slay thy selfe?
And slay thy Lady, that in thy life lies,


By doing damned hate vpon thy selfe?
Why rayl'st thou on thy birth?
the heauen and earth?
Since birth, and heauen and earth, all three do meete


In thee at once, which thou at once would'st loose.
Fie, fie, thou sham'st thy shape, thy loue, thy wit,


Which like a Vsurer abound'st in all:


And vsest none in that true vse indeed,


Which should bedecke thy shape, thy loue, thy wit:


Thy Noble shape, is but a forme of waxe,


Digressing from the Valour of a man,


Thy deare Loue sworne but hollow periurie,


Killing that Loue which thou hast vow'd to cherish.
Thy wit, that Ornament, to shape and Loue,


Mishapen in the conduct of them both:


Like powder in a skillesse Souldiers flaske,


Is set a fire by thine owne ignorance,


And thou dismembred with thine owne defence.
What, rowse thee man, thy Iuliet is aliue,


For whose deare sake thou wast but lately dead.
There art thou happy.
Tybalt would kill thee,


But thou slew'st Tybalt, there art thou happie.
The law that threatned death became thy Friend.
And turn'd it to exile, there art thou happy.
A packe or blessing light vpon thy backe,


Happinesse Courts thee in her best array,


But like a mishaped and sullen wench,


Thou puttest vp thy Fortune and thy Loue:


Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Goe get thee to thy Loue as was decreed,


Ascend her Chamber, hence and comfort her:


But looke thou stay not till the watch be set,


For then thou canst not passe to Mantua,


Where thou shalt liue till we can finde a time


To blaze your marriage, reconcile your Friends,


Beg pardon of thy Prince, and call thee backe,


With twenty hundred thousand times more ioy


Then thou went'st forth in lamentation.
Goe before Nurse, commend me to thy Lady,


And bid her hasten all the house to bed,


Which heauy sorrow makes them apt vnto.
Romeo is comming


   Nur.
O Lord, I could haue staid here all night,


To heare good counsell: oh what learning is!
My Lord Ile tell my Lady you will come


   Rom.
Do so, and bid my Sweete prepare to chide
   Nur.
Heere sir, a Ring she bid me giue you sir:


Hie you, make hast, for it growes very late


   Rom.
How well my comfort is reuiu'd by this
   Fri. Go hence,


Goodnight, and here stands all your state:


Either be gone before the watch be set,


Or by the breake of day disguis'd from hence,


Soiourne in Mantua, Ile find out your man,


And he shall signifie from time to time,


Euery good hap to you, that chaunces heere:


Giue me thy hand, 'tis late, farewell, goodnight


   Rom.
But that a ioy past ioy, calls out on me,


It were a griefe, so briefe to part with thee:


Farewell.
Exeunt.
Enter old Capulet, his Wife and Paris.
Cap.
Things haue falne out sir so vnluckily,


That we haue had no time to moue our Daughter:


Looke you, she Lou'd her kinsman Tybalt dearely,


And so did I.
Well, we were borne to die.
'Tis very late, she'l not come downe to night:


I promise you, but for your company,


I would haue bin a bed an houre ago


   Par.
These times of wo, affoord no times to wooe:


Madam goodnight, commend me to your Daughter


   Lady.
I will, and know her mind early to morrow,


To night, she is mewed vp to her heauinesse


   Cap.
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender


Of my Childes loue: I thinke she will be rul'd


In all respects by me: nay more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,


Acquaint her here, of my Sonne Paris Loue,


And bid her, marke you me, on Wendsday next,


But soft, what day is this?
Par.
Monday my Lord


   Cap.
Monday, ha ha: well Wendsday is too soone,


A Thursday let it be: a Thursday tell her,


She shall be married to this Noble Earle:


Will you be ready?
do you like this hast?
Weele keepe no great adoe, a Friend or two,


For harke you, Tybalt being slaine so late,


It may be thought we held him carelesly,


Being our kinsman, if we reuell much:


Therefore weele haue some halfe a dozen Friends,


And there an end.
But what say you to Thursday?
Paris.
My Lord,


I would that Thursday were to morrow


   Cap.
Well, get you gone, a Thursday, be it then:


Go you to Iuliet ere you go to bed,


Prepare her wife, against this wedding day.
Farewell my Lord, light to my Chamber hoa,


Afore me, it is so late, that we may call it early by and by,


Goodnight.
Exeunt.
Enter Romeo and Iuliet aloft.
Iul.
Wilt thou be gone?
It is not yet neere day:


It was the Nightingale, and not the Larke,


That pier'st the fearefull hollow of thine eare,


Nightly she sings on yond Pomgranet tree,


Beleeue me Loue, it was the Nightingale


   Rom.
It was the Larke the Herauld of the Morne:


No Nightingale: looke Loue what enuious streakes


Do lace the seuering Cloudes in yonder East:


Nights Candles are burnt out, and Iocond day


Stands tipto on the mistie Mountaines tops,


I must be gone and liue, or stay and die


   Iul.
Yond light is not daylight, I know it I:


It is some Meteor that the Sun exhales,


To be to thee this night a Torch-bearer,


And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
Therefore stay yet, thou need'st not be gone,


  Rom.
Let me be tane, let me be put to death,


I am content, so thou wilt haue it so.
Ile say yon gray is not the mornings eye,


'Tis but the pale reflexe of Cinthias brow.
Nor that is not Larke whose noates do beate


The vaulty heauen so high aboue our heads,


I haue more care to stay, then will to go:


Come death and welcome, Iuliet wills it so.
How ist my soule, lets talke, it is not day


   Iuli.
It is, it is, hie hence be gone away:


It is the Larke that sings so out of tune,


Straining harsh Discords, and vnpleasing Sharpes.
Some say the Larke makes sweete Diuision;


This doth not so: for she diuideth vs.
Some say, the Larke and loathed Toad change eyes,


O now I would they had chang'd voyces too:


Since arme from arme that voyce doth vs affray,


Hunting thee hence, with Hunts-vp to the day,


O now be gone, more light and it light growes


   Rom.
More light & light, more darke & darke our woes.
Enter Madam and Nurse.
Nur.
Madam
   Iul.
Nurse
   Nur.
Your Lady Mother is comming to your chamber,


The day is broke, be wary, looke about


   Iul.
Then window let day in, and let life out
   Rom.
Farewell, farewell, one kisse and Ile descend
   Iul.
Art thou gone so?
Loue, Lord, ay Husband, Friend,


I must heare from thee euery day in the houre,


For in a minute there are many dayes,


O by this count I shall be much in yeares,


Ere I againe behold my Romeo


   Rom.
Farewell:


I will omit no oportunitie,


That may conuey my greetings Loue, to thee


   Iul.
O thinkest thou we shall euer meet againe?
Rom.
I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serue


For sweet discourses in our time to come


   Iuliet.
O God!
I haue an ill Diuining soule,


Me thinkes I see thee now, thou art so lowe,


As one dead in the bottome of a Tombe,


Either my eye-sight failes, or thou look'st pale


   Rom.
And trust me Loue, in my eye so do you:


Drie sorrow drinkes our blood.
Adue, adue.
Enter.
Iul.
O Fortune, Fortune, all men call thee fickle,


If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him


That is renown'd for faith?
be fickle Fortune:


For then I hope thou wilt not keepe him long,


But send him backe.
Enter Mother.
Lad.
Ho Daughter, are you vp?
Iul.
Who ist that calls?
Is it my Lady Mother.
Is she not downe so late, or vp so early?
What vnaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
Lad.
Why how now Iuliet?
Iul.
Madam I am not well


   Lad.
Euermore weeping for your Cozins death?
What wilt thou wash him from his graue with teares?
And if thou could'st, thou could'st not make him liue:


Therefore haue done, some griefe shewes much of Loue,


But much of griefe, shewes still some want of wit


   Iul.
Yet let me weepe, for such a feeling losse
   Lad.
So shall you feele the losse, but not the Friend


Which you weepe for


   Iul.
Feeling so the losse,


I cannot chuse but euer weepe the Friend


   La.
Well Girle, thou weep'st not so much for his death,


As that the Villaine liues which slaughter'd him


   Iul.
What Villaine, Madam?
Lad.
That same Villaine Romeo


   Iul.
Villaine and he, be many miles assunder:


God pardon, I doe with all my heart:


And yet no man like he, doth grieue my heart


   Lad.
That is because the Traitor liues
   Iul.
I Madam from the reach of these my hands:


Would none but I might venge my Cozins death


   Lad.
We will haue vengeance for it, feare thou not.
Then weepe no more, Ile send to one in Mantua,


Where that same banisht Run-agate doth liue,


Shall giue him such an vnaccustom'd dram,


That he shall soone keepe Tybalt company:


And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied


   Iul.
Indeed I neuer shall be satisfied


With Romeo, till I behold him.
Dead


Is my poore heart so for a kinsman vext:


Madam, if you could find out but a man


To beare a poyson, I would temper it;


That Romeo should vpon receit thereof,


Soone sleepe in quiet.
O how my heart abhors


To heare him nam'd, and cannot come to him,


To wreake the Loue I bore my Cozin,


Vpon his body that hath slaughter'd him


   Mo.
Find thou the meanes, and Ile find such a man.
But now Ile tell thee ioyfull tidings Gyrle


   Iul.
And ioy comes well, in such a needy time,


What are they, beseech your Ladyship?
Mo.
Well, well, thou hast a carefull Father Child?
One who to put thee from thy heauinesse,


Hath sorted out a sudden day of ioy,


That thou expects not, nor I lookt not for


   Iul.
Madam in happy time, what day is this?
Mo.
Marry my Child, early next Thursday morne,


The gallant, young, and Noble Gentleman,


The Countie Paris at Saint Peters Church,


Shall happily make thee a ioyfull Bride


   Iul.
Now by Saint Peters Church, and Peter too,


He shall not make me there a ioyfull Bride.
I wonder at this hast, that I must wed


Ere he that should be Husband comes to woe:


I pray you tell my Lord and Father Madam,


I will not marrie yet, and when I doe, I sweare


It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate


Rather then Paris.
These are newes indeed


   Mo.
Here comes your Father, tell him so your selfe,


And see how he will take it at your hands.
Enter Capulet and Nurse.
Cap.
When the Sun sets, the earth doth drizzle deaw


But for the Sunset of my Brothers Sonne,


It raines downright.
How now?
A Conduit Gyrle, what still in teares?
Euermore showring in one little body?
Thou counterfaits a Barke, a Sea, a Wind:


For still thy eyes, which I may call the Sea,


Do ebbe and flow with teares, the Barke thy body is


Sayling in this salt floud, the windes thy sighes,


Who raging with the teares and they with them,


Without a sudden calme will ouer set


Thy tempest tossed body.
How now wife?
Haue you deliuered to her our decree?
Lady.
I sir;


But she will none, she giues you thankes,


I would the foole were married to her graue


   Cap.
Soft, take me with you, take me with you wife,


How, will she none?
doth she not giue vs thanks?
Is she not proud?
doth she not count her blest,


Vnworthy as she is, that we haue wrought


So worthy a Gentleman, to be her Bridegroome


  Iul.
Not proud you haue,


But thankfull that you haue:


Proud can I neuer be of what I haue,


But thankfull euen for hate, that is meant Loue


   Cap.
How now?
How now?
Chopt Logicke?
what is this?
Proud, and I thanke you: and I thanke you not.
Thanke me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,


But fettle your fine ioints 'gainst Thursday next,


To go with Paris to Saint Peters Church:


Or I will drag thee, on a Hurdle thither.
Out you greene sicknesse carrion, out you baggage,


You tallow face


   Lady.
Fie, fie, what are you mad?
Iul.
Good Father, I beseech you on my knees


Heare me with patience, but to speake a word


   Fa.
Hang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch,


I tell thee what, get thee to Church a Thursday,


Or neuer after looke me in the face.
Speake not, reply not, do not answere me.
My fingers itch, wife: we scarce thought vs blest,


That God had lent vs but this onely Child,


But now I see this one is one too much,


And that we haue a curse in hauing her:


Out on her Hilding


   Nur.
God in heauen blesse her,


You are too blame my Lord to rate her so


   Fa.
And why my Lady wisedome?
hold your tongue,


Good Prudence, smatter with your gossip, go


   Nur.
I speak no treason,


Father, O Godigoden,


May not one speake?
Fa.
Peace you mumbling foole,


Vtter your grauitie ore a Gossips bowles


For here we need it not


   La.
You are too hot
   Fa.
Gods bread, it makes me mad:


Day, night, houre, ride, time, worke, play,


Alone in companie, still my care hath bin


To haue her matcht, and hauing now prouided


A Gentleman of Noble Parentage,


Of faire Demeanes, Youthfull, and Nobly Allied,


Stuft as they say with Honourable parts,


Proportion'd as ones thought would wish a man,


And then to haue a wretched puling foole,


A whining mammet, in her Fortunes tender,


To answer, Ile not wed, I cannot Loue:


I am too young, I pray you pardon me.
But, and you will not wed, Ile pardon you.
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me:


Looke too't, thinke on't, I do not vse to iest.
Thursday is neere, lay hand on heart, aduise,


And you be mine, Ile giue you to my Friend:


And you be not, hang, beg, starue, die in the streets,


For by my soule, Ile nere acknowledge thee,


Nor what is mine shall neuer do thee good:


Trust too't, bethinke you, Ile not be forsworne


Enter.
Iuli.
Is there no pittie sitting in the Cloudes,


That sees into the bottome of my griefe?
O sweet my Mother cast me not away,


Delay this marriage, for a month, a weeke,


Or if you do not, make the Bridall bed


In that dim Monument where Tybalt lies


   Mo.
Talke not to me, for Ile not speake a word,


Do as thou wilt, for I haue done with thee.
Enter.
Iul.
O God!
O Nurse, how shall this be preuented?
My Husband is on earth, my faith in heauen,


How shall that faith returne againe to earth,


Vnlesse that Husband send it me from heauen,


By leauing earth?
Comfort me, counsaile me:


Alacke, alacke, that heauen should practise stratagems


Vpon so soft a subiect as my selfe.
What saist thou?
hast thou not a word of ioy?
Some comfort Nurse


   Nur.
Faith here it is,


Romeo is banished, and all the world to nothing,


That he dares nere come backe to challenge you:


Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then since the case so stands as now it doth,


I thinke it best you married with the Countie,


O hee's a Louely Gentleman:


Romeos a dish-clout to him: an Eagle Madam


Hath not so greene, so quicke, so faire an eye


As Paris hath, beshrow my very heart,


I thinke you are happy in this second match,


For it excels your first: or if it did not,


Your first is dead, or 'twere as good he were,


As liuing here and you no vse of him


   Iul.
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Nur.
And from my soule too,


Or else beshrew them both


   Iul.
Amen
   Nur.
What?
Iul.
Well, thou hast comforted me marue'lous much,


Go in, and tell my Lady I am gone,


Hauing displeas'd my Father, to Lawrence Cell,


To make confession, and to be absolu'd


   Nur.
Marrie I will, and this is wisely done
   Iul.
Auncient damnation, O most wicked fiend!
It is more sin to wish me thus forsworne,


Or to dispraise my Lord with that same tongue


Which she hath prais'd him with aboue compare,


So many thousand times?
Go Counsellor,


Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twaine:


Ile to the Frier to know his remedie,


If all else faile, my selfe haue power to die.
Exeunt.
Enter Frier and Countie Paris.
Fri. On Thursday sir?
the time is very short
   Par.
My Father Capulet will haue it so,


And I am nothing slow to slack his hast


   Fri. You say you do not know the Ladies mind?
Vneuen is the course, I like it not


   Pa. Immoderately she weepes for Tybalts death,


And therfore haue I little talke of Loue,


For Venus smiles not in a house of teares.
Now sir, her Father counts it dangerous


That she doth giue her sorrow so much sway:


And in his wisedome, hasts our marriage,


To stop the inundation of her teares,


Which too much minded by her selfe alone,


May be put from her by societie.
Now doe you know the reason of this hast?
Fri.
I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
Looke sir, here comes the Lady towards my Cell.
Enter Iuliet.
Par.
Happily met, my Lady and my wife
   Iul.
That may be sir, when I may be a wife
   Par.
That may be, must be Loue, on Thursday next
   Iul.
What must be shall be
   Fri. That's a certaine text
   Par.
Come you to make confession to this Father?
Iul.
To answere that, I should confesse to you


   Par.
Do not denie to him, that you Loue me
   Iul.
I will confesse to you that I Loue him
   Par.
So will ye, I am sure that you Loue me
   Iul.
If I do so, it will be of more price,


Being spoke behind your backe, then to your face


   Par.
Poore soule, thy face is much abus'd with teares
   Iul.
The teares haue got small victorie by that:


For it was bad inough before their spight


   Pa. Thou wrong'st it more then teares with that report
   Iul.
That is no slaunder sir, which is a truth,


And what I spake, I spake it to thy face


   Par.
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slaundred it
   Iul.
It may be so, for it is not mine owne.
Are you at leisure, Holy Father now,


Or shall I come to you at euening Masse?
Fri. My leisure serues me pensiue daughter now.
My Lord you must intreat the time alone


   Par.
Godsheild: I should disturbe Deuotion,


Iuliet, on Thursday early will I rowse yee,


Till then adue, and keepe this holy kisse.
Exit Paris.
Iul.
O shut the doore, and when thou hast done so,


Come weepe with me, past hope, past care, past helpe


   Fri. O Iuliet, I alreadie know thy griefe,


It streames me past the compasse of my wits:


I heare thou must and nothing may prorogue it,


On Thursday next be married to this Countie


   Iul.
Tell me not Frier that thou hearest of this,


Vnlesse thou tell me how I may preuent it:


If in thy wisedome, thou canst giue no helpe,


Do thou but call my resolution wise,


And with this knife, Ile helpe it presently.
God ioyn'd my heart, and Romeos, thou our hands,


And ere this hand by thee to Romeo seal'd:


Shall be the Labell to another Deede,


Or my true heart with trecherous reuolt,


Turne to another, this shall slay them both:


Therefore out of thy long experien'st time,


Giue me some present counsell, or behold


Twixt my extreames and me, this bloody knife


Shall play the vmpeere, arbitrating that,


Which the commission of thy yeares and art,


Could to no issue of true honour bring:


Be not so long to speak, I long to die,


If what thou speak'st, speake not of remedy


   Fri.
Hold Daughter, I doe spie a kind of hope,


Which craues as desperate an execution,


As that is desperate which we would preuent.
If rather then to marrie Countie Paris


Thou hast the strength of will to slay thy selfe,


Then is it likely thou wilt vndertake


A thing like death to chide away this shame,


That coap'st with death himselfe, to scape fro it:


And if thou dar'st, Ile giue thee remedie


   Iul.
Oh bid me leape, rather then marrie Paris,


From of the Battlements of any Tower,


Or walke in theeuish waies, or bid me lurke


Where Serpents are: chaine me with roaring Beares


Or hide me nightly in a Charnell house,


Orecouered quite with dead mens ratling bones,


With reckie shankes and yellow chappels sculls:


Or bid me go into a new made graue,


And hide me with a dead man in his graue,


Things that to heare them told, haue made me tremble,


And I will doe it without feare or doubt,


To liue an vnstained wife to my sweet Loue


   Fri.
Hold then: goe home, be merrie, giue consent,


To marrie Paris: wensday is to morrow,


To morrow night looke that thou lie alone,


Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy Chamber:


Take thou this Violl being then in bed,


And this distilling liquor drinke thou off,


When presently through all thy veines shall run,


A cold and drowsie humour: for no pulse


Shall keepe his natiue progresse, but surcease:


No warmth, no breath shall testifie thou liuest,


The Roses in thy lips and cheekes shall fade


To many ashes, the eyes windowes fall


Like death when he shut vp the day of life:


Each part depriu'd of supple gouernment,


Shall stiffe and starke, and cold appeare like death,


And in this borrowed likenesse of shrunke death


Thou shalt continue two and forty houres,


And then awake, as from a pleasant sleepe.
Now when the Bridegroome in the morning comes,


To rowse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:


Then as the manner of our country is,


In thy best Robes vncouer'd on the Beere,


Be borne to buriall in thy kindreds graue:


Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault,


Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie,


In the meane time against thou shalt awake,


Shall Romeo by my Letters know our drift,


And hither shall he come, and that very night


Shall Romeo beare thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present shame,


If no inconstant toy nor womanish feare,


Abate thy valour in the acting it


   Iul.
Giue me, giue me, O tell me not of care
   Fri.
Hold get you gone, be strong and prosperous:


In this resolue, Ile send a Frier with speed


To Mantua with my Letters to thy Lord


   Iu.
Loue giue me strength,


And the strength shall helpe afford:


Farewell deare father.
Exit
Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Seruing men, two or
three.
Cap.
So many guests inuite as here are writ,


Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning Cookes


   Ser.
You shall haue none ill sir, for Ile trie if they can


licke their fingers


   Cap.
How canst thou trie them so?
Ser.
Marrie sir, 'tis an ill Cooke that cannot licke his


owne fingers: therefore he that cannot licke his fingers


goes not with me


   Cap.
Go be gone, we shall be much vnfurnisht for this


time: what is my Daughter gone to Frier Lawrence?
Nur.
I forsooth


   Cap.
Well he may chance to do some good on her,


A peeuish selfe-wild harlotry it is.
Enter Iuliet.
Nur.
See where she comes from shrift


With merrie looke


   Cap.
How now my headstrong,


Where haue you bin gadding?
Iul.
Where I haue learnt me to repent the sin


Of disobedient opposition:


To you and your behests, and am enioyn'd


By holy Lawrence, to fall prostrate here,


To beg your pardon: pardon I beseech you,


Henceforward I am euer rul'd by you


   Cap.
Send for the Countie, goe tell him of this,


Ile haue this knot knit vp to morrow morning


   Iul.
I met the youthfull Lord at Lawrence Cell,


And gaue him what becomed Loue I might,


Not stepping ore the bounds of modestie


   Cap.
Why I am glad on't, this is well, stand vp,


This is as't should be, let me see the County:


I marrie go I say, and fetch him hither.
Now afore God, this reueren'd holy Frier,


All our whole Cittie is much bound to him


   Iul.
Nurse will you goe with me into my Closet,


To helpe me sort such needfull ornaments,


As you thinke fit to furnish me to morrow?
Mo.
No not till Thursday, there's time inough


   Fa.
Go Nurse, go with her,


Weele to Church to morrow.
Exeunt.
Iuliet and Nurse.
Mo.
We shall be short in our prouision,


'Tis now neere night


   Fa.
Tush, I will stirre about,


And all things shall be well, I warrant thee wife:


Go thou to Iuliet, helpe to decke vp her,


Ile not to bed to night, let me alone:


Ile play the huswife for this once.
What ho?
They are all forth, well I will walke my selfe


To Countie Paris, to prepare him vp


Against to morrow, my heart is wondrous light,


Since this same way-ward Gyrle is so reclaim'd.
Exeunt.
Father and Mother.
Enter Iuliet and Nurse.
Iul.
I those attires are best, but gentle Nurse


I pray thee leaue me to my selfe to night:


For I haue need of many Orysons,


To moue the heauens to smile vpon my state,


Which well thou know'st, is crosse and full of sin.
Enter Mother.
Mo.
What are you busie ho?
need you my help?
Iul.
No Madam, we haue cul'd such necessaries


As are behoouefull for our state to morrow:


So please you, let me now be left alone;


And let the Nurse this night sit vp with you,


For I am sure, you haue your hands full all,


In this so sudden businesse


   Mo.
Goodnight.
Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.
Exeunt.
Iul.
Farewell:


God knowes when we shall meete againe.
I haue a faint cold feare thrills through my veines,


That almost freezes vp the heate of fire:


Ile call them backe againe to comfort me.
Nurse, what should she do here?
My dismall Sceane, I needs must act alone:


Come Viall, what if this mixture do not worke at all?
Shall I be married then to morrow morning?
No, no, this shall forbid it.
Lie thou there,


What if it be a poyson which the Frier


Subtilly hath ministred to haue me dead,


Least in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,


Because he married me before to Romeo?
I feare it is, and yet me thinkes it should not,


For he hath still beene tried a holy man.
How, if when I am laid into the Tombe,


I wake before the time that Romeo


Come to redeeme me?
There's a fearefull point:


Shall I not then be stifled in the Vault?
To whose foule mouth no healthsome ayre breaths in,


And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes.
Or if I liue, is it not very like,


The horrible conceit of death and night,


Together with the terror of the place,


As in a Vaulte, an ancient receptacle,


Where for these many hundred yeeres the bones


Of all my buried Auncestors are packt,


Where bloody Tybalt, yet but greene in earth,


Lies festring in his shrow'd, where as they say,


At some houres in the night, Spirits resort:


Alacke, alacke, is it not like that I


So early waking, what with loathsome smels,


And shrikes like Mandrakes torne out of the earth,


That liuing mortalls hearing them, run mad.
O if I wake, shall I not be distraught,


Inuironed with all these hidious feares,


And madly play with my forefathers ioynts?
And plucke the mangled Tybalt from his shrow'd?
And in this rage, with some great kinsmans bone,


As (with a club) dash out my desperate braines.
O looke, me thinks I see my Cozins Ghost,


Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body


Vpon my Rapiers point: stay Tybalt, stay;


Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here's drinke: I drinke to thee.
Enter Lady of the house, and Nurse.
Lady.
Hold,


Take these keies, and fetch more spices Nurse


   Nur.
They call for Dates and Quinces in the Pastrie.
Enter old Capulet.
Cap.
Come, stir, stir, stir,


The second Cocke hath Crow'd,


The Curphew Bell hath rung, 'tis three a clocke:


Looke to the bakte meates, good Angelica,


Spare not for cost


   Nur.
Go you Cot-queane, go,


Get you to bed, faith youle be sicke to morrow


For this nights watching


   Cap.
No not a whit: what?
I haue watcht ere now


All night for lesse cause, and nere beene sicke


   La.
I you haue bin a Mouse-hunt in your time,


But I will watch you from such watching now.
Exit Lady and Nurse.
Cap.
A iealous hood, a iealous hood,


Now fellow, what there?
Enter three or foure with spits, and logs, and baskets.
Fel.
Things for the Cooke sir, but I know not what
   Cap.
Make hast, make hast, sirrah, fetch drier Logs.
Call Peter, he will shew thee where they are


   Fel.
I haue a head sir, that will find out logs,


And neuer trouble Peter for the matter


   Cap.
Masse and well said, a merrie horson, ha,


Thou shalt be loggerhead; good Father, 'tis day.
Play Musicke
The Countie will be here with Musicke straight,


For so he said he would, I heare him neere,


Nurse, wife, what ho?
what Nurse I say?
Enter Nurse.
Go waken Iuliet, go and trim her vp,


Ile go and chat with Paris: hie, make hast,


Make hast, the Bridegroome, he is come already:


Make hast I say


   Nur.
Mistris, what Mistris?
Iuliet?
Fast I warrant her she.
Why Lambe, why Lady?
fie you sluggabed,


Why Loue I say?
Madam, sweet heart: why Bride?
What not a word?
You take your peniworths now.
Sleepe for a weeke, for the next night I warrant


The Countie Paris hath set vp his rest,


That you shall rest but little, God forgiue me:


Marrie and Amen: how sound is she a sleepe?
I must needs wake her: Madam, Madam, Madam,


I, let the Countie take you in your bed,


Heele fright you vp yfaith.
Will it not be?
What drest, and in your clothes, and downe againe?
I must needs wake you: Lady, Lady, Lady?
Alas, alas, helpe, helpe, my Ladyes dead,


Oh weladay, that euer I was borne,


Some Aqua-vitć ho, my Lord, my Lady?
Mo.
What noise is heere?
Enter Mother.
Nur.
O lamentable day
   Mo.
What is the matter?
Nur.
Looke, looke, oh heauie day


   Mo.
O me, O me, my Child, my onely life:


Reuiue, looke vp, or I will die with thee:


Helpe, helpe, call helpe.
Enter Father.
Fa.
For shame bring Iuliet forth, her Lord is come
   Nur.
Shee's dead: deceast, shee's dead: alacke the day
   M. Alacke the day, shee's dead, shee's dead, shee's dead
   Fa.
Ha?
Let me see her: out alas shee's cold,


Her blood is setled and her ioynts are stiffe:


Life and these lips haue long bene seperated:


Death lies on her like an vntimely frost


Vpon the swetest flower of all the field


   Nur.
O Lamentable day!
Mo.
O wofull time


   Fa.
Death that hath tane her hence to make me waile,


Ties vp my tongue, and will not let me speake.
Enter Frier and the Countie.
Fri. Come, is the Bride ready to go to Church?
Fa.
Ready to go, but neuer to returne.
O Sonne, the night before thy wedding day,


Hath death laine with thy wife: there she lies,


Flower as she was, deflowred by him.
Death is my Sonne in law, death is my Heire,


My Daughter he hath wedded.
I will die,


And leaue him all life liuing, all is deaths


   Pa. Haue I thought long to see this mornings face,


And doth it giue me such a sight as this?
Mo.
Accur'st, vnhappie, wretched hatefull day,


Most miserable houre, that ere time saw


In lasting labour of his Pilgrimage.
But one, poore one, one poore and louing Child,


But one thing to reioyce and solace in,


And cruell death hath catcht it from my sight


   Nur.
O wo, O wofull, wofull, wofull day,


Most lamentable day, most wofull day,


That euer, euer, I did yet behold.
O day, O day, O day, O hatefull day,


Neuer was seene so blacke a day as this:


O wofull day, O wofull day


   Pa. Beguild, diuorced, wronged, spighted, slaine,


Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,


By cruell, cruell thee, quite ouerthrowne:


O loue, O life; not life, but loue in death


   Fat.
Despis'd, distressed, hated, martir'd, kil'd,


Vncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now


To murther, murther our solemnitie?
O Child, O Child; my soule, and not my Child,


Dead art thou, alacke my Child is dead,


And with my Child, my ioyes are buried


   Fri. Peace ho for shame, confusions: Care liues not


In these confusions, heauen and your selfe


Had part in this faire Maid, now heauen hath all,


And all the better is it for the Maid:


Your part in her, you could not keepe from death,


But heauen keepes his part in eternall life:


The most you sought was her promotion,


For 'twas your heauen, she shouldst be aduan'st,


And weepe ye now, seeing she is aduan'st


Aboue the Cloudes, as high as Heauen it selfe?
O in this loue, you loue your Child so ill,


That you run mad, seeing that she is well:


Shee's not well married, that liues married long,


But shee's best married, that dies married yong.
Drie vp your teares, and sticke your Rosemarie


On this faire Coarse, and as the custome is,


And in her best array beare her to Church:


For though some Nature bids all vs lament,


Yet Natures teares are Reasons merriment


   Fa.
All things that we ordained Festiuall,


Turne from their office to blacke Funerall:


Our instruments to melancholy Bells,


Our wedding cheare, to a sad buriall Feast:


Our solemne Hymnes, to sullen Dyrges change:


Our Bridall flowers serue for a buried Coarse:


And all things change them to the contrarie


   Fri. Sir go you in; and Madam, go with him,


And go sir Paris, euery one prepare


To follow this faire Coarse vnto her graue:


The heauens do lowre vpon you, for some ill:


Moue them no more, by crossing their high will.
Exeunt.
Mu.
Faith we may put vp our Pipes and be gone
   Nur.
Honest goodfellowes: Ah put vp, put vp,


For well you know, this is a pitifull case


   Mu.
I by my troth, the case may be amended.
Enter Peter.
Pet.
Musitions, oh Musitions,


Hearts ease, hearts ease,


O, and you will haue me liue, play hearts ease


   Mu.
Why hearts ease;


  Pet.
O Musitions,


Because my heart it selfe plaies, my heart is full


   Mu.
Not a dump we, 'tis no time to play now
   Pet.
You will not then?
Mu.
No


   Pet.
I will then giue it you soundly
   Mu.
What will you giue vs?
Pet.
No money on my faith, but the gleeke.
I will giue you the Minstrell


   Mu.
Then will I giue you the Seruing creature
   Peter.
Then will I lay the seruing Creatures Dagger


on your pate.
I will carie no Crochets, Ile Re you, Ile Fa


you, do you note me?
Mu.
And you Re vs, and Fa vs, you Note vs


   2.M.
Pray you put vp your Dagger,
And put out your wit.
Then haue at you with my wit
   Peter.
I will drie-beate you with an yron wit,


And put vp my yron Dagger.
Answere me like men:


When griping griefes the heart doth wound, then Musicke


with her siluer sound.
Why siluer sound?
why Musicke with her siluer sound?
what say you Simon Catling?
Mu.
Mary sir, because siluer hath a sweet sound


   Pet.
Pratest, what say you Hugh Rebicke?
2.M.
I say siluer sound, because Musitions sound for siluer


  Pet.
Pratest to, what say you Iames Sound-Post?
3.Mu.
Faith I know not what to say


   Pet.
O I cry you mercy, you are the Singer.
I will say for you; it is Musicke with her siluer sound,


Because Musitions haue no gold for sounding:


Then Musicke with her siluer sound, with speedy helpe


doth lend redresse.
Enter.
Mu.
What a pestilent knaue is this same?
M.2.
Hang him Iacke, come weele in here, tarrie for


the Mourners, and stay dinner.
Enter.
Enter Romeo.
Rom.
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleepe,


My dreames presage some ioyfull newes at hand:


My bosomes L[ord].
sits lightly in his throne:


And all this day an vnaccustom'd spirit,


Lifts me aboue the ground with cheerefull thoughts.
I dreamt my Lady came and found me dead,


(Strange dreame that giues a dead man leaue to thinke,)


And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips,


That I reuiu'd and was an Emperour.
Ah me, how sweet is loue it selfe possest,


When but loues shadowes are so rich in ioy.
Enter Romeo's man.
Newes from Verona, how now Balthazer?
Dost thou not bring me Letters from the Frier?
How doth my Lady?
Is my Father well?
How doth my Lady Iuliet?
that I aske againe,


For nothing can be ill, is she be well


   Man.
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
Her body sleepes in Capels Monument,


And her immortall part with Angels liue,


I saw her laid low in her kindreds Vault,


And presently tooke Poste to tell it you:


O pardon me for bringing these ill newes,


Since you did leaue it for my office Sir


   Rom.
Is it euen so?
Then I denie you Starres.
Thou knowest my lodging, get me inke and paper,


And hire Post-Horses, I will hence to night


   Man.
I do beseech you sir, haue patience:


Your lookes are pale and wild, and do import


Some misaduenture


   Rom.
Tush, thou art deceiu'd,


Leaue me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no Letters to me from the Frier?
Man.
No my good Lord.
Exit Man.
Rom.
No matter: Get thee gone,


And hyre those Horses, Ile be with thee straight,


Well Iuliet, I will lie with thee to night:


Lets see for meanes, O mischiefe thou art swift,


To enter in the thoughts of desperate men:


I do remember an Appothecarie,


And here abouts dwells, which late I noted


In tattred weeds, with ouerwhelming browes,


Culling of Simples, meager were his lookes,


Sharp miserie had worne him to the bones:


And in his needie shop a Tortoyrs hung,


An Allegater stuft, and other skins


Of ill shap'd fishes, and about his shelues,


A beggerly account of emptie boxes ,


Greene earthen pots, Bladders, and mustie seedes,


Remnants of packthred, and old cakes of Roses


Were thinly scattered, to make vp a shew.
Noting this penury, to my selfe I said,


An if a man did need a poyson now,


Whose sale is present death in Mantua,


Here liues a Caitiffe wretch would sell it him.
O this same thought did but fore-run my need,


And this same needie man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house,


Being holy day, the beggers shop is shut.
What ho?
Appothecarie?
Enter Appothecarie.
App.
Who call's so low'd?
Rom.
Come hither man, I see that thou art poore,


Hold, there is fortie Duckets, let me haue


A dram of poyson, such soone speeding geare,


As will disperse it selfe through all the veines,


That the life-wearie-taker may fall dead,


And that the Trunke may be discharg'd of breath,


As violently, as hastie powder fier'd


Doth hurry from the fatall Canons wombe


   App.
Such mortall drugs I haue, but Mantuas law


Is death to any he, that vtters them


   Rom.
Art thou so bare and full of wretchednesse,


And fear'st to die?
Famine is in thy cheekes,


Need and opression starueth in thy eyes,


Contempt and beggery hangs vpon thy backe:


The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law:


The world affords no law to make thee rich.
Then be not poore, but breake it, and take this


   App.
My pouerty, but not my will consents
   Rom.
I pray thy pouerty, and not thy will
   App.
Put this in any liquid thing you will


And drinke it off, and if you had the strength


Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight


   Rom.
There's thy Gold,


Worse poyson to mens soules,


Doing more murther in this loathsome world,


Then these poore compounds that thou maiest not sell.
I sell thee poyson, thou hast sold me none,


Farewell, buy food, and get thy selfe in flesh.
Come Cordiall, and not poyson, go with me


To Iuliets graue, for there must I vse thee.
Exeunt.
Enter Frier Iohn to Frier Lawrence.
Iohn.
Holy Franciscan Frier, Brother, ho?
Enter Frier Lawrence.
Law.
This same should be the voice of Frier Iohn.
Welcome from Mantua, what sayes Romeo?
Or if his mind be writ, giue me his Letter


   Iohn.
Going to find a bare-foote Brother out,


One of our order to associate me,


Here in this Citie visiting the sick,


And finding him, the Searchers of the Towne


Suspecting that we both were in a house


Where the infectious pestilence did raigne,


Seal'd vp the doores, and would not let vs forth,


So that my speed to Mantua there was staid


   Law.
Who bare my Letter then to Romeo?
Iohn.
I could not send it, here it is againe,


Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,


So fearefull were they of infection


   Law.
Vnhappie Fortune: by my Brotherhood


The Letter was not nice; but full of charge,


Of deare import; and the neglecting it


May do much danger: Frier Iohn go hence,


Get me an Iron Crow, and bring it straight


Vnto my Cell


   Iohn.
Brother Ile go and bring it thee.
Enter.
Law.
Now must I to the Monument alone,


Within this three houres will faire Iuliet wake,


Shee will beshrew me much that Romeo


Hath had no notice of these accidents:


But I will write againe to Mantua,


And keepe her at my Cell till Romeo come,


Poore liuing Coarse, clos'd in a dead mans Tombe,


Enter.
Enter Paris and his Page.
Par.
Giue me thy Torch Boy, hence and stand aloft,


Yet put it out, for I would not be seene:


Vnder yond young Trees lay thee all along,


Holding thy eare close to the hollow ground,


So shall no foot vpon the Churchyard tread,


Being loose, vnfirme with digging vp of Graues,


But thou shalt heare it: whistle then to me,


As signall that thou hearest some thing approach,


Giue me those flowers.
Do as I bid thee, go


   Page.
I am almost afraid to stand alone


Here in the Churchyard, yet I will aduenture


   Pa. Sweet Flower with flowers thy Bridall bed I strew:


O woe, thy Canopie is dust and stones,


Which with sweet water nightly I will dewe,


Or wanting that, with teares destil'd by mones;


The obsequies that I for thee will keepe,


Nightly shall be, to strew thy graue, and weepe.
Whistle Boy.
The Boy giues warning, something doth approach,


What cursed foot wanders this wayes to night,


To crosse my obsequies, and true loues right?
What with a Torch?
Muffle me night a while.
Enter Romeo, and Peter.
Rom.
Giue me that Mattocke, & the wrenching Iron,


Hold take this Letter, early in the morning


See thou deliuer it to my Lord and Father,


Giue me the light; vpon thy life I charge thee,


What ere thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloofe,


And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death,


Is partly to behold my Ladies face:


But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger,


A precious Ring, a Ring that I must vse,


In deare employment, therefore hence be gone:


But if thou iealous dost returne to prie


In what I further shall intend to do,


By heauen I will teare thee ioynt by ioynt,


And strew this hungry Churchyard with thy limbs:


The time, and my intents are sauage wilde:


More fierce and more inexorable farre,


Them emptie Tygers, or the roaring Sea


   Pet.
I will be gone sir, and not trouble you


  Ro.
So shalt thou shew me friendship: take thou that,


Liue and be prosperous, and farewell good fellow


   Pet.
For all this same, Ile hide me here about,


His lookes I feare, and his intents I doubt


   Rom.
Thou detestable mawe, thou wombe of death,


Gorg'd with the dearest morsell of the earth:


Thus I enforce thy rotten Iawes to open,


And in despight, Ile cram thee with more food


   Par.
This is that banisht haughtie Mountague,


That murdred my Loues Cozin; with which griefe,


It is supposed the faire Creature died,


And here is come to do some villanous shame


To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
Stop thy vnhallowed toyle, vile Mountague:


Can vengeance be pursued further then death?
Condemned villaine, I do apprehend thee.
Obey and go with me, for thou must die,


  Rom.
I must indeed, and therfore came I hither:


Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man,


Flie hence and leaue me, thinke vpon those gone,


Let them affright thee.
I beseech thee Youth,


Put not an other sin vpon my head,


By vrging me to furie.
O be gone,


By heauen I loue thee better then my selfe,


For I come hither arm'd against my selfe:


Stay not, be gone, liue, and hereafter say,


A mad mans mercy bid thee run away


   Par.
I do defie thy commisseration,


And apprehend thee for a Fellon here


   Ro.
Wilt thou prouoke me?
Then haue at thee Boy
   Pet.
O Lord they fight, I will go call the Watch
   Pa. O I am slaine, if thou be mercifull,


Open the Tombe, lay me with Iuliet


   Rom.
In faith I will, let me peruse this face:


Mercutius kinsman, Noble Countie Paris,


What said my man, when my betossed soule


Did not attend him as we rode?
I thinke


He told me Paris should haue married Iuliet.
Said he not so?
Or did I dreame it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talke of Iuliet,


To thinke it was so?
O giue me thy hand,


One, writ with me in sowre misfortunes booke.
Ile burie thee in a triumphant graue.
A Graue; O no, a Lanthorne; slaughtred Youth:


For here lies Iuliet, and her beautie makes


This Vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death lie thou there, by a dead man inter'd,


How oft when men are at the point of death,


Haue they beene merrie?
Which their Keepers call


A lightning before death?
Oh how may I


Call this a lightning?
O my Loue, my Wife,


Death that hath suckt the honey of thy breath,


Hath had no power yet vpon thy Beautie:


Thou are not conquer'd: Beauties ensigne yet


Is Crymson in thy lips, and in thy cheekes,


And Deaths pale flag is not aduanced there.
Tybalt, ly'st thou there in thy bloudy sheet?
O what more fauour can I do to thee,


Then with that hand that cut thy youth in twaine,


To sunder his that was thy enemie?
Forgiue me Cozen.
Ah deare Iuliet:


Why art thou yet so faire?
I will beleeue,


Shall I beleeue, that vnsubstantiall death is amorous?
And that the leane abhorred Monster keepes


Thee here in darke to be his Paramour?
For feare of that, I still will stay with thee,


And neuer from this Pallace of dym night


Depart againe: come lie thou in my armes,


Heere's to thy health, where ere thou tumblest in.
O true Appothecarie!
Thy drugs are quicke.
Thus with a kisse I die.
Depart againe; here, here will I remaine,


With Wormes that are thy Chambermaides: O here


Will I set vp my euerlasting rest:


And shake the yoke of inauspicious starres


From this world-wearied flesh: Eyes looke your last:


Armes take your last embrace: And lips, O you


The doores of breath, seale with a righteous kisse


A datelesse bargaine to ingrossing death:


Come bitter conduct, come vnsauory guide,


Thou desperate Pilot, now at once run on


The dashing Rocks, thy Sea-sicke wearie Barke:


Heere's to my Loue.
O true Appothecary:


Thy drugs are quicke.
Thus with a kisse I die.
Enter Frier with a Lanthorne, Crow, and Spade.
Fri. St. Francis be my speed, how oft to night


Haue my old feet stumbled at graues?
Who's there?
Man.
Here's one, a Friend, & one that knowes you well


   Fri. Blisse be vpon you.
Tell me good my Friend


What Torch is yond that vainely lends his light


To grubs, and eyelesse Sculles?
As I discerne,


It burneth in the Capels Monument


   Man.
It doth so holy sir,


And there's my Master, one that you loue


   Fri. Who is it?
Man.
Romeo


   Fri. How long hath he bin there?
Man.
Full halfe an houre


   Fri. Go with me to the Vault
   Man.
I dare not Sir.
My Master knowes not but I am gone hence,


And fearefully did menace me with death,


If I did stay to looke on his entents


   Fri. Stay, then Ile go alone, feares comes vpon me.
O much I feare some ill vnluckie thing


   Man.
As I did sleepe vnder this young tree here,


I dreamt my maister and another fought,


And that my Maister slew him


   Fri. Romeo.
Alacke, alacke, what blood is this which staines


The stony entrance of this Sepulcher?
What meane these Masterlesse, and goarie Swords


To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
Romeo, oh pale: who else?
what Paris too?
And steept in blood?
Ah what an vnkind houre


Is guiltie of this lamentable chance?
The Lady stirs


   Iul.
O comfortable Frier, where's my Lord?
I do remember well where I should be:


And there I am, where is my Romeo?
Fri.
I heare some noyse Lady, come from that nest


Of death, contagion, and vnnaturall sleepe,


A greater power then we can contradict


Hath thwarted our entents, come, come away,


Thy husband in thy bosome there lies dead:


And Paris too: come Ile dispose of thee,


Among a Sisterhood of holy Nunnes:


Stay not to question, for the watch is comming.
Come, go good Iuliet, I dare no longer stay.
Enter.
Iul.
Go get thee hence, for I will not away,


What's here, A cup clos'd in my true loues hand?
Poyson I see hath bin his timelesse end


O churle, drinke all?
and left no friendly drop,


To helpe me after, I will kisse thy lips,


Happlie some poyson yet doth hang on them,


To make me die with a restoratiue.
Thy lips are warme.
Enter Boy and Watch.
Watch.
Lead Boy, which way?
Iul.
Yea noise?
Then ile be briefe.
O happy Dagger.
'Tis in thy sheath, there rust and let me die.
Kils herselfe.
Boy.
This is the place,


There where the Torch doth burne


  Watch.
The ground is bloody,


Search about the Churchyard.
Go some of you, who ere you find attach.
Pittifull sight, here lies the Countie slaine,


And Iuliet bleeding, warme and newly dead


Who here hath laine these two dayes buried.
Go tell the Prince, runne to the Capulets,


Raise vp the Mountagues, some others search,


We see the ground whereon these woes do lye,


But the true ground of all these piteous woes,


We cannot without circumstance descry.
Enter Romeo's man.
Watch.
Here's Romeo's man,


We found him in the Churchyard


   Con.
Hold him in safety, till the Prince come hither.
Enter Frier, and another Watchman.
3.Wat.
Here is a Frier that trembles, sighes, and weepes
We tooke this Mattocke and this Spade from him,
As he was comming from this Church-yard side
   Con.
A great suspition, stay the Frier too.
Enter the Prince.
Prin.
What misaduenture is so earely vp,


That calls our person from our mornings rest?
Enter Capulet and his Wife.
Cap.
What should it be that they so shrike abroad?
Wife.
O the people in the streete crie Romeo.
Some Iuliet, and some Paris, and all runne


With open outcry toward our Monument


   Pri.
What feare is this which startles in your eares?
Wat.
Soueraigne, here lies the Countie Paris slaine,


And Romeo dead, and Iuliet dead before,


Warme and new kil'd


   Prin.
Search,


Seeke, and know how, this foule murder comes


   Wat.
Here is a Frier, and Slaughter'd Romeos man,


With Instruments vpon them fit to open


These dead mens Tombes


   Cap.
O heauen!
O wife looke how our Daughter bleedes!
This Dagger hath mistaine, for loe his house


Is empty on the backe of Mountague,


And is misheathed in my Daughters bosome


   Wife.
O me, this sight of death, is as a Bell


That warnes my old age to a Sepulcher.
Enter Mountague.
Pri.
Come Mountague, for thou art early vp


To see thy Sonne and Heire, now early downe


   Moun.
Alas my liege, my wife is dead to night,


Griefe of my Sonnes exile hath stopt her breath:


What further woe conspires against my age?
Prin.
Looke: and thou shalt see


   Moun.
O thou vntaught, what manners is in this,


To presse before thy Father to a graue?
Prin.
Seale vp the mouth of outrage for a while,


Till we can cleare these ambiguities,


And know their spring, their head, their true descent,


And then I will be generall of your woes,


And lead you euen to death?
meane time forbeare,


And let mischance be slaue to patience,


Bring forth the parties of suspition


   Fri.
I am the greatest, able to doe least,


Yet most suspected as the time and place


Doth make against me of this direfull murther:


And heere I stand both to impeach and purge


My selfe condemned, and my selfe excus'd


   Prin.
Then say at once, what thou dost know in this?
Fri.
I will be briefe, for my short date of breath


Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo there dead, was husband to that Iuliet,


And she there dead, that's Romeos faithfull wife:


I married them; and their stolne marriage day


Was Tybalts Doomesday: whose vntimely death


Banish'd the new-made Bridegroome from this Citie:


For whom (and not for Tybalt) Iuliet pinde.
You, to remoue that siege of Greefe from her,


Betroth'd, and would haue married her perforce


To Countie Paris.
Then comes she to me,


And (with wilde lookes) bid me deuise some meanes


To rid her from this second Marriage,


Or in my Cell there would she kill her selfe.
Then gaue I her (so Tutor'd by my Art)


A sleeping Potion, which so tooke effect


As I intended, for it wrought on her


The forme of death.
Meane time, I writ to Romeo,


That he should hither come, as this dyre night,


To helpe to take her from her borrowed graue,


Being the time the Potions force should cease.
But he which bore my Letter, Frier Iohn,


Was stay'd by accident; and yesternight


Return'd my Letter backe.
Then all alone,


At the prefixed houre of her waking,


Came I to take her from her Kindreds vault,


Meaning to keepe her closely at my Cell,


Till I conueniently could send to Romeo.
But when I came (some Minute ere the time


Of her awaking) heere vntimely lay


The Noble Paris, and true Romeo dead.
Shee wakes, and I intreated her come foorth,


And beare this worke of Heauen, with patience:


But then, a noyse did scarre me from the Tombe,


And she (too desperate) would not go with me,


But (as it seemes) did violence on her selfe.
All this I know, and to the Marriage her Nurse is priuy:


And if ought in this miscarried by my fault,


Let my old life be sacrific'd, some houre before the time,


Vnto the rigour of seuerest Law


   Prin.
We still haue knowne thee for a Holy man.
Where's Romeo's man?
What can he say to this?
Boy.
I brought my Master newes of Iuliets death,


And then in poste he came from Mantua


To this same place, to this same Monument.
This Letter he early bid me giue his Father,


And threatned me with death, going in the Vault,


If I departed not, and left him there


   Prin.
Giue me the Letter, I will look on it.
Where is the Counties Page that rais'd the Watch?
Sirra, what made your Master in this place?
Page.
He came with flowres to strew his Ladies graue,


And bid me stand aloofe, and so I did:


Anon comes one with light to ope the Tombe,


And by and by my Maister drew on him,


And then I ran away to call the Watch


   Prin.
This Letter doth make good the Friers words,


Their course of Loue, the tydings of her death:


And heere he writes, that he did buy a poyson


Of a poore Pothecarie, and therewithall


Came to this Vault to dye, and lye with Iuliet.
We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.
A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.
To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.
Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.
Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.
The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.
This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.
If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.
[10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.
At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.
We need your donations more than ever!
All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.
(CMU = Carnegie-
Mellon University).

Executive Director's Notes:
In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
are presented herein:

***
As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a "cliche".
.
.this is the
original meaning of the term cliche.
.
.and thus, being unwilling
to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd.
.
.such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
above.
.
.and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner.
.
.
.
The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
time when they were out of "v"'s.
.
.possibly having used "vv" in
place of some "w"'s, etc.
This was a common practice of the day,
as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.
You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.
My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose.
To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
.
.
.in great detail.
.
.and determined from the various changes,
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
for signing his name with several different spellings.
So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
that are "not" errors.
.
.
.
So.
.
.with this caveat.
.
.we have NOT changed the canon errors,
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The first
Part of Henry the Sixt.

Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.
This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text.
The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae.
I have left the spelling,
punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text.
I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them.
Everything within
brackets [] is what I have added.
So if you don't like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare.
Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio.
So there may
be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
this and other first folio editions.
This is due to the printer's
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run.
The proof run wasn't thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies.
This is just the way it is.
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions' best pages.
If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors.
I wish to make this the best
etext possible.
My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
and davidr@inconnect.com.
I hope that you enjoy this.

All's Well, that Ends Well
Actus primus.
Scoena Prima.
Enter yong Bertram Count of Rossillion, his Mother, and Helena,


Lord


Lafew, all in blacke.
Mother.
In deliuering my sonne from me, I burie a second


husband


   Ros.
And I in going Madam, weep ore my
fathers death anew; but I must attend his maiesties
command, to whom I am now in Ward, euermore
in subiection
   Laf.
You shall find of the King a husband Madame,
you sir a father.
He that so generally is at all times good,
must of necessitie hold his vertue to you, whose worthinesse
would stirre it vp where it wanted rather then lack
it where there is such abundance
   Mo.
What hope is there of his Maiesties amendment?
Laf.
He hath abandon'd his Phisitions Madam, vnder
whose practises he hath persecuted time with hope,
and finds no other aduantage in the processe, but onely
the loosing of hope by time
   Mo.
This yong Gentlewoman had a father, O that
had, how sad a passage tis, whose skill was almost as
great as his honestie, had it stretch'd so far, would haue
made nature immortall, and death should haue play for
lacke of worke.
Would for the Kings sake hee were liuing,
I thinke it would be the death of the Kings disease
   Laf.
How call'd you the man you speake of Madam?
Mo.
He was famous sir in his profession, and it was


his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon


   Laf.
He was excellent indeed Madam, the King very
latelie spoke of him admiringly, and mourningly: hee
was skilfull enough to haue liu'd stil, if knowledge could
be set vp against mortallitie
   Ros.
What is it (my good Lord) the King languishes


of?
Laf.
A Fistula my Lord


   Ros.
I heard not of it before
   Laf.
I would it were not notorious.
Was this Gentlewoman
the Daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
Mo.
His sole childe my Lord, and bequeathed to my
ouer looking.
I haue those hopes of her good, that her
education promises her dispositions shee inherits, which
makes faire gifts fairer: for where an vncleane mind carries
vertuous qualities, there commendations go with
pitty, they are vertues and traitors too: in her they are
the better for their simplenesse; she deriues her honestie,
and atcheeues her goodnesse
   Lafew.
Your commendations Madam get from her
teares
   Mo.
'Tis the best brine a Maiden can season her praise
in.
The remembrance of her father neuer approches her
heart, but the tirrany of her sorrowes takes all liuelihood
from her cheeke.
No more of this Helena, go too, no
more least it be rather thought you affect a sorrow, then
to haue-
  Hell.
I doe affect a sorrow indeed, but I haue it too
   Laf.
Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,


excessiue greefe the enemie to the liuing


   Mo.
If the liuing be enemie to the greefe, the excesse


makes it soone mortall


   Ros.
Maddam I desire your holie wishes
   Laf.
How vnderstand we that?
Mo.
Be thou blest Bertrame, and succeed thy father


In manners as in shape: thy blood and vertue


Contend for Empire in thee, and thy goodnesse


Share with thy birth-right.
Loue all, trust a few,


Doe wrong to none: be able for thine enemie


Rather in power then vse: and keepe thy friend


Vnder thy owne lifes key.
Be checkt for silence,


But neuer tax'd for speech.
What heauen more wil,


That thee may furnish, and my prayers plucke downe,


Fall on thy head.
Farwell my Lord,


'Tis an vnseason'd Courtier, good my Lord


Aduise him


   Laf.
He cannot want the best


That shall attend his loue


   Mo.
Heauen blesse him: Farwell Bertram
   Ro.
The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoghts
be seruants to you: be comfortable to my mother, your
Mistris, and make much of her
   Laf.
Farewell prettie Lady, you must hold the credit


of your father


   Hell.
O were that all, I thinke not on my father,


And these great teares grace his remembrance more


Then those I shed for him.
What was he like?
I haue forgott him.
My imagination


Carries no fauour in't but Bertrams.
I am vndone, there is no liuing, none,


If Bertram be away.
'Twere all one,


That I should loue a bright particuler starre,


And think to wed it, he is so aboue me


In his bright radience and colaterall light,


Must I be comforted, not in his sphere;


Th' ambition in my loue thus plagues it selfe:


The hind that would be mated by the Lion


Must die for loue.
'Twas prettie, though a plague


To see him euerie houre to sit and draw


His arched browes, his hawking eie, his curles


In our hearts table: heart too capeable


Of euerie line and tricke of his sweet fauour.
But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancie


Must sanctifie his Reliques.
Who comes heere?
Enter Parrolles.
One that goes with him: I loue him for his sake,


And yet I know him a notorious Liar,


Thinke him a great way foole, solie a coward,


Yet these fixt euils sit so fit in him,


That they take place, when Vertues steely bones


Lookes bleake i'th cold wind: withall, full ofte we see


Cold wisedome waighting on superfluous follie


   Par.
Saue you faire Queene
   Hel.
And you Monarch
   Par.
No
   Hel.
And no
   Par.
Are you meditating on virginitie?
Hel.
I: you haue some staine of souldier in you: Let


mee aske you a question.
Man is enemie to virginitie,


how may we barracado it against him?
Par.
Keepe him out


   Hel.
But he assailes, and our virginitie though valiant,
in the defence yet is weak: vnfold to vs some war-like
resistance
   Par.
There is none: Man setting downe before you,
will vndermine you, and blow you vp
   Hel.
Blesse our poore Virginity from vnderminers
and blowers vp.
Is there no Military policy how Virgins
might blow vp men?
Par.
Virginity beeing blowne downe, Man will
quicklier be blowne vp: marry in blowing him downe
againe, with the breach your selues made, you lose your
Citty.
It is not politicke, in the Common-wealth of
Nature, to preserue virginity.
Losse of Virginitie, is
rationall encrease, and there was neuer Virgin goe, till
virginitie was first lost.
That you were made of, is mettall
to make Virgins.
Virginitie, by beeing once lost,
may be ten times found: by being euer kept, it is euer
lost: 'tis too cold a companion: Away with't
   Hel.
I will stand for't a little, though therefore I die
a Virgin
   Par.
There's little can bee saide in't, 'tis against the
rule of Nature.
To speake on the part of virginitie, is
to accuse your Mothers; which is most infallible disobedience.
He that hangs himselfe is a Virgin: Virginitie
murthers it selfe, and should be buried in highwayes
out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate Offendresse against
Nature.
Virginitie breedes mites, much like a
Cheese, consumes it selfe to the very payring, and so
dies with feeding his owne stomacke.
Besides, Virginitie
is peeuish, proud, ydle, made of selfe-loue, which
is the most inhibited sinne in the Cannon.
Keepe it not,
you cannot choose but loose by't.
Out with't: within
ten yeare it will make it selfe two, which is a goodly increase,
and the principall it selfe not much the worse.
Away with't
   Hel.
How might one do sir, to loose it to her owne
liking?
Par.
Let mee see.
Marry ill, to like him that ne're
it likes.
'Tis a commodity wil lose the glosse with lying:
The longer kept, the lesse worth: Off with't while 'tis
vendible.
Answer the time of request, Virginitie like
an olde Courtier, weares her cap out of fashion, richly
suted, but vnsuteable, iust like the brooch & the tooth-pick,
which were not now: your Date is better in your
Pye and your Porredge, then in your cheeke: and your
virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French
wither'd peares, it lookes ill, it eates drily, marry 'tis a
wither'd peare: it was formerly better, marry yet 'tis a
wither'd peare: Will you any thing with it?
Hel.
Not my virginity yet:
There shall your Master haue a thousand loues,
A Mother, and a Mistresse, and a friend,
A Phenix, Captaine, and an enemy,
A guide, a Goddesse, and a Soueraigne,
A Counsellor, a Traitoresse, and a Deare:
His humble ambition, proud humility:
His iarring, concord: and his discord, dulcet:
His faith, his sweet disaster: with a world
Of pretty fond adoptious christendomes
That blinking Cupid gossips.
Now shall he:
I know not what he shall, God send him well,
The Courts a learning place, and he is one
   Par.
What one ifaith?
Hel.
That I wish well, 'tis pitty


   Par.
What's pitty?
Hel.
That wishing well had not a body in't,


Which might be felt, that we the poorer borne,


Whose baser starres do shut vs vp in wishes,


Might with effects of them follow our friends,


And shew what we alone must thinke, which neuer


Returnes vs thankes.
Enter Page.
Pag.
Monsieur Parrolles,


My Lord cals for you


   Par.
Little Hellen farewell, if I can remember thee, I


will thinke of thee at Court


   Hel.
Monsieur Parolles, you were borne vnder a


charitable starre


   Par.
Vnder Mars I
   Hel.
I especially thinke, vnder Mars
   Par.
Why vnder Mars?
Hel.
The warres hath so kept you vnder, that you


must needes be borne vnder Mars


   Par.
When he was predominant
   Hel.
When he was retrograde I thinke rather
   Par.
Why thinke you so?
Hel.
You go so much backward when you fight


   Par.
That's for aduantage
   Hel.
So is running away,
When feare proposes the safetie:
But the composition that your valour and feare makes
in you, is a vertue of a good wing, and I like the
weare well
   Paroll.
I am so full of businesses, I cannot answere
thee acutely: I will returne perfect Courtier, in the
which my instruction shall serue to naturalize thee, so
thou wilt be capeable of a Courtiers councell, and vnderstand
what aduice shall thrust vppon thee, else thou
diest in thine vnthankfulnes, and thine ignorance makes
thee away, farewell: When thou hast leysure, say thy
praiers: when thou hast none, remember thy Friends:
Get thee a good husband, and vse him as he vses thee:
So farewell
   Hel.
Our remedies oft in our selues do lye,


Which we ascribe to heauen: the fated skye


Giues vs free scope, onely doth backward pull


Our slow designes, when we our selues are dull.
What power is it, which mounts my loue so hye,


That makes me see, and cannot feede mine eye?
The mightiest space in fortune, Nature brings


To ioyne like, likes; and kisse like natiue things.
Impossible be strange attempts to those


That weigh their paines in sence, and do suppose


What hath beene, cannot be.
Who euer stroue


To shew her merit, that did misse her loue?
(The Kings disease) my proiect may deceiue me,


But my intents are fixt, and will not leaue me.

King.
The Florentines and Senoys are by th' eares,


Haue fought with equall fortune, and continue

So tis reported sir
   King.
Nay tis most credible, we heere receiue it,


A certaintie vouch'd from our Cosin Austria,


With caution, that the Florentine will moue vs


For speedie ayde: wherein our deerest friend


Preiudicates the businesse, and would seeme


To haue vs make deniall

His loue and wisedome
Approu'd so to your Maiesty, may pleade
For amplest credence

It is the Count Rosignoll my good Lord,


Yong Bertram


   King.
Youth, thou bear'st thy Fathers face,


Franke Nature rather curious then in hast


Hath well compos'd thee: Thy Fathers morall parts


Maist thou inherit too: Welcome to Paris


   Ber.
My thankes and dutie are your Maiesties
   Kin.
I would I had that corporall soundnesse now,


As when thy father, and my selfe, in friendship


First tride our souldiership: he did looke farre


Into the seruice of the time, and was


Discipled of the brauest.
He lasted long,


But on vs both did haggish Age steale on,


And wore vs out of act: It much repaires me


To talke of your good father; in his youth


He had the wit, which I can well obserue


To day in our yong Lords: but they may iest


Till their owne scorne returne to them vnnoted


Ere they can hide their leuitie in honour:


So like a Courtier, contempt nor bitternesse


Were in his pride, or sharpnesse; if they were,


His equall had awak'd them, and his honour


Clocke to it selfe, knew the true minute when


Exception bid him speake: and at this time


His tongue obey'd his hand.
Who were below him,


He vs'd as creatures of another place,


And bow'd his eminent top to their low rankes,


Making them proud of his humilitie,


In their poore praise he humbled: Such a man


Might be a copie to these yonger times;


Which followed well, would demonstrate them now


But goers backward


   Ber.
His good remembrance sir


Lies richer in your thoughts, then on his tombe:


So in approofe liues not his Epitaph,


As in your royall speech


   King.
Would I were with him he would alwaies say,


(Me thinkes I heare him now) his plausiue words


He scatter'd not in eares, but grafted them


To grow there and to beare: Let me not liue,


This his good melancholly oft began


On the Catastrophe and heele of pastime


When it was out: Let me not liue (quoth hee)


After my flame lackes oyle, to be the snuffe


Of yonger spirits, whose apprehensiue senses


All but new things disdaine; whose iudgements are


Meere fathers of their garments: whose constancies


Expire before their fashions: this he wish'd.
I after him, do after him wish too:


Since I nor wax nor honie can bring home,


I quickly were dissolued from my hiue


To giue some Labourers roome


   2.L.E.
You'r loued Sir,


They that least lend it you, shall lacke you first


   Kin.
I fill a place I know't: how long ist Count


Since the Physitian at your fathers died?
He was much fam'd


   Ber.
Some six moneths since my Lord
   Kin.
If he were liuing, I would try him yet.
Lend me an arme: the rest haue worne me out


With seuerall applications: Nature and sicknesse


Debate it at their leisure.
Welcome Count,

Maddam the care I haue had to euen your content,
I wish might be found in the Kalender of my past
endeuours, for then we wound our Modestie, and make
foule the clearnesse of our deseruings, when of our selues
we publish them
   Coun.
What doe's this knaue heere?
Get you gone
sirra: the complaints I haue heard of you I do not all beleeue,
'tis my slownesse that I doe not: For I know you
lacke not folly to commit them, & haue abilitie enough
to make such knaueries yours
   Clo.
'Tis not vnknown to you Madam, I am a poore
fellow
   Coun.
Well sir
   Clo.
No maddam,
'Tis not so well that I am poore, though manie
of the rich are damn'd, but if I may haue your Ladiships
good will to goe to the world, Isbell the woman and I
will doe as we may
   Coun.
Wilt thou needes be a begger?
Clo.
I doe beg your good will in this case


   Cou.
In what case?
Clo.
In Isbels case and mine owne: seruice is no heritage,


and I thinke I shall neuer haue the blessing of God,


till I haue issue a my bodie: for they say barnes are blessings


   Cou.
Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marrie?
Clo.
My poore bodie Madam requires it, I am driuen


on by the flesh, and hee must needes goe that the diuell


driues


   Cou.
Is this all your worships reason?
Clo.
Faith Madam I haue other holie reasons, such as


they are


   Cou.
May the world know them?
Clo.
I haue beene Madam a wicked creature, as you


and all flesh and blood are, and indeede I doe marrie that


I may repent


   Cou.
Thy marriage sooner then thy wickednesse
   Clo.
I am out a friends Madam, and I hope to haue
friends for my wiues sake
   Cou.
Such friends are thine enemies knaue
   Clo.
Y'are shallow Madam in great friends, for the
knaues come to doe that for me which I am a wearie of:
he that eres my Land, spares my teame, and giues mee
leaue to Inne the crop: if I be his cuckold hee's my
drudge; he that comforts my wife, is the cherisher of
my flesh and blood; hee that cherishes my flesh and
blood, loues my flesh and blood; he that loues my flesh
and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my
friend: if men could be contented to be what they are,
there were no feare in marriage, for yong Charbon the
Puritan, and old Poysam the Papist, how somere their
hearts are seuer'd in Religion, their heads are both one,
they may ioule horns together like any Deare i'th Herd
   Cou.
Wilt thou euer be a foule mouth'd and calumnious
knaue?
Clo.
A Prophet I Madam, and I speake the truth the
next waie, for I the Ballad will repeate, which men full
true shall finde, your marriage comes by destinie, your
Cuckow sings by kinde
   Cou.
Get you gone sir, Ile talke with you more anon
   Stew.
May it please you Madam, that hee bid Hellen


come to you, of her I am to speake


   Cou.
Sirra tell my gentlewoman I would speake with


her, Hellen I meane


   Clo.
Was this faire face the cause, quoth she,


Why the Grecians sacked Troy,


Fond done, done, fond was this King Priams ioy,


With that she sighed as she stood,


bis
And gaue this sentence then, among nine bad if one be
good, among nine bad if one be good, there's yet one
good in ten
   Cou.
What, one good in tenne?
you corrupt the song
sirra
   Clo.
One good woman in ten Madam, which is a purifying
ath' song: would God would serue the world so
all the yeere, weed finde no fault with the tithe woman
if I were the Parson, one in ten quoth a?
and wee might
haue a good woman borne but ore euerie blazing starre,
or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the Lotterie well, a
man may draw his heart out ere a plucke one
   Cou.
Youle begone sir knaue, and doe as I command
you?
Clo.
That man should be at womans command, and
yet no hurt done, though honestie be no Puritan, yet
it will doe no hurt, it will weare the Surplis of humilitie
ouer the blacke-Gowne of a bigge heart: I am going
forsooth, the businesse is for Helen to come hither.
Enter.
Cou.
Well now
   Stew.
I know Madam you loue your Gentlewoman
intirely
   Cou.
Faith I doe: her Father bequeath'd her to mee,
and she her selfe without other aduantage, may lawfullie
make title to as much loue as shee findes, there is
more owing her then is paid, and more shall be paid
her then sheele demand
   Stew.
Madam, I was verie late more neere her then
I thinke shee wisht mee, alone shee was, and did
communicate to her selfe her owne words to her
owne eares, shee thought, I dare vowe for her, they
toucht not anie stranger sence, her matter was, shee
loued your Sonne; Fortune shee said was no goddesse,
that had put such difference betwixt their two
estates: Loue no god, that would not extend his might
onelie, where qualities were leuell, Queene of Virgins,
that would suffer her poore Knight surpris'd
without rescue in the first assault or ransome afterward:
This shee deliuer'd in the most bitter touch of
sorrow that ere I heard Virgin exclaime in, which I held
my dutie speedily to acquaint you withall, sithence in
the losse that may happen, it concernes you something
to know it
   Cou.
You haue discharg'd this honestlie, keepe it
to your selfe, manie likelihoods inform'd mee of this
before, which hung so tottring in the ballance, that
I could neither beleeue nor misdoubt: praie you
leaue mee, stall this in your bosome, and I thanke
you for your honest care: I will speake with you further
anon.
Exit Steward.
Enter Hellen.
Old.Cou.
Euen so it was with me when I was yong:


If euer we are natures, these are ours, this thorne


Doth to our Rose of youth rightlie belong


Our bloud to vs, this to our blood is borne,


It is the show, and seale of natures truth,


Where loues strong passion is imprest in youth,


By our remembrances of daies forgon,


Such were our faults, or then we thought them none,


Her eie is sicke on't, I obserue her now


   Hell.
What is your pleasure Madam?
Ol.Cou.
You know Hellen I am a mother to you


   Hell.
Mine honorable Mistris
   Ol.Cou.
Nay a mother, why not a mother?
when I


sed a mother


Me thought you saw a serpent, what's in mother,


That you start at it?
I say I am your mother,


And put you in the Catalogue of those


That were enwombed mine, 'tis often seene


Adoption striues with nature, and choise breedes


A natiue slip to vs from forraine seedes:


You nere opprest me with a mothers groane,


Yet I expresse to you a mothers care,


(Gods mercie maiden) dos it curd thy blood


To say I am thy mother?
what's the matter,


That this distempered messenger of wet?
The manie colour'd Iris rounds thine eye?
- Why, that you are my


daughter?
Hell.
That I am not


   Old.Cou.
I say I am your Mother
   Hell.
Pardon Madam.
The Count Rosillion cannot be my brother:


I am from humble, he from honored name:


No note vpon my Parents, his all noble,


My Master, my deere Lord he is, and I


His seruant liue, and will his vassall die:


He must not be my brother


   Ol.Cou.
Nor I your Mother
   Hell.
You are my mother Madam, would you were


So that my Lord your sonne were not my brother,


Indeede my mother, or were you both our mothers,


I care no more for, then I doe for heauen,


So I were not his sister, cant no other,


But I your daughter, he must be my brother


   Old.Cou.
Yes Hellen, you might be my daughter in law,


God shield you meane it not, daughter and mother


So striue vpon your pulse; what pale agen?
My feare hath catcht your fondnesse!
now I see


The mistrie of your louelinesse, and finde


Your salt teares head, now to all sence 'tis grosse:


You loue my sonne, inuention is asham'd


Against the proclamation of thy passion


To say thou doost not: therefore tell me true,


But tell me then 'tis so, for looke, thy cheekes


Confesse it 'ton tooth to th' other, and thine eies


See it so grosely showne in thy behauiours,


That in their kinde they speake it, onely sinne


And hellish obstinacie tye thy tongue


That truth should be suspected, speake, ist so?
If it be so, you haue wound a goodly clewe:


If it be not, forsweare't how ere I charge thee,


As heauen shall worke in me for thine auaile


To tell me truelie


   Hell.
Good Madam pardon me
   Cou.
Do you loue my Sonne?
Hell.
Your pardon noble Mistris


   Cou.
Loue you my Sonne?
Hell.
Doe not you loue him Madam?
Cou.
Goe not about; my loue hath in't a bond


Whereof the world takes note: Come, come, disclose:


The state of your affection, for your passions


Haue to the full appeach'd


   Hell.
Then I confesse


Here on my knee, before high heauen and you,


That before you, and next vnto high heauen, I loue your


Sonne:


My friends were poore but honest, so's my loue:


Be not offended, for it hurts not him


That he is lou'd of me; I follow him not


By any token of presumptuous suite,


Nor would I haue him, till I doe deserue him,


Yet neuer know how that desert should be:


I know I loue in vaine, striue against hope:


Yet in this captious, and intemible Siue.
I still poure in the waters of my loue


And lacke not to loose still; thus Indian like


Religious in mine error, I adore


The Sunne that lookes vpon his worshipper,


But knowes of him no more.
My deerest Madam,


Let not your hate incounter with my loue,


For louing where you doe; but if your selfe,


Whose aged honor cites a vertuous youth,


Did euer, in so true a flame of liking,


Wish chastly, and loue dearely, that your Dian


Was both her selfe and loue, O then giue pittie


To her whose state is such, that cannot choose


But lend and giue where she is sure to loose;


That seekes not to finde that, her search implies,


But riddle like, liues sweetely where she dies


   Cou.
Had you not lately an intent, speake truely,


To goe to Paris?
Hell.
Madam I had


   Cou.
Wherefore?
tell true
   Hell.
I will tell truth, by grace it selfe I sweare:


You know my Father left me some prescriptions


Of rare and prou'd effects, such as his reading


And manifest experience, had collected


For generall soueraigntie: and that he wil'd me


In heedefull'st reseruation to bestow them,


As notes, whose faculties inclusiue were,


More then they were in note: Amongst the rest,


There is a remedie, approu'd, set downe,


To cure the desperate languishings whereof


The King is render'd lost


   Cou.
This was your motiue for Paris, was it, speake?
Hell.
My Lord, your sonne, made me to think of this;


Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King,


Had from the conuersation of my thoughts,


Happily beene absent then


   Cou.
But thinke you Hellen,


If you should tender your supposed aide,


He would receiue it?
He and his Phisitions


Are of a minde, he, that they cannot helpe him:


They, that they cannot helpe, how shall they credit


A poore vnlearned Virgin, when the Schooles


Embowel'd of their doctrine, haue left off


The danger to it selfe


   Hell.
There's something in't


More then my Fathers skill, which was the great'st


Of his profession, that his good receipt,


Shall for my legacie be sanctified


Byth' luckiest stars in heauen, and would your honor


But giue me leaue to trie successe, I'de venture


The well lost life of mine, on his Graces cure,


By such a day, an houre


   Cou.
Doo'st thou beleeue't?
Hell.
I Madam knowingly


   Cou.
Why Hellen thou shalt haue my leaue and loue,


Meanes and attendants, and my louing greetings


To those of mine in Court, Ile staie at home


And praie Gods blessing into thy attempt:


Begon to morrow, and be sure of this,


What I can helpe thee to, thou shalt not misse.
Exeunt.
Actus Secundus.
Enter the King with diuers yong Lords, taking leaue for the
Florentine
warre: Count, Rosse, and Parrolles.
Florish Cornets.
King.
Farewell yong Lords, these warlike principles


Doe not throw from you, and you my Lords farewell:


Share the aduice betwixt you, if both gaine, all


The guift doth stretch it selfe as 'tis receiu'd,


And is enough for both


   Lord.G.
'Tis our hope sir,


After well entred souldiers, to returne


And finde your grace in health


   King.
No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart


Will not confesse he owes the mallady


That doth my life besiege: farwell yong Lords,


Whether I liue or die, be you the sonnes


Of worthy French men: let higher Italy


(Those bated that inherit but the fall


Of the last Monarchy) see that you come


Not to wooe honour, but to wed it, when


The brauest questant shrinkes: finde what you seeke,


That fame may cry you loud: I say farewell


   L.G.
Health at your bidding serue your Maiesty
   King.
Those girles of Italy, take heed of them,


They say our French, lacke language to deny


If they demand: beware of being Captiues


Before you serue


   Bo.
Our hearts receiue your warnings
   King.
Farewell, come hether to me
   1.Lo.G.
Oh my sweet Lord y you wil stay behind vs
   Parr.
'Tis not his fault the spark
   2.Lo.E.
Oh 'tis braue warres
   Parr.
Most admirable, I haue seene those warres
   Rossill.
I am commanded here, and kept a coyle with,


Too young, and the next yeere, and 'tis too early


   Parr.
And thy minde stand too't boy,


Steale away brauely


   Rossill.
I shal stay here the for-horse to a smocke,


Creeking my shooes on the plaine Masonry,


Till honour be bought vp, and no sword worne


But one to dance with: by heauen, Ile steale away


   1.Lo.G.
There's honour in the theft
   Parr.
Commit it Count
   2.Lo.E.
I am your accessary, and so farewell
   Ros.
I grow to you, & our parting is a tortur'd body
   1.Lo.G.
Farewell Captaine
   2.Lo.E.
Sweet Mounsier Parolles
   Parr.
Noble Heroes; my sword and yours are kinne,
good sparkes and lustrous, a word good mettals.
You
shall finde in the Regiment of the Spinij, one Captaine
Spurio his sicatrice, with an Embleme of warre heere on
his sinister cheeke; it was this very sword entrench'd it:
say to him I liue, and obserue his reports for me
   Lo.G.
We shall noble Captaine
   Parr.
Mars doate on you for his nouices, what will


ye doe?
Ross.
Stay the King


   Parr.
Vse a more spacious ceremonie to the Noble
Lords, you haue restrain'd your selfe within the List of
too cold an adieu: be more expressiue to them; for they
weare themselues in the cap of the time, there do muster
true gate; eat, speake, and moue vnder the influence of
the most receiu'd starre, and though the deuill leade the
measure, such are to be followed: after them, and take a
more dilated farewell
   Ross.
And I will doe so
   Parr.
Worthy fellowes, and like to prooue most sinewie
sword-men.
Exeunt.
Enter Lafew.
L.Laf.
Pardon my Lord for mee and for my tidings
   King.
Ile see thee to stand vp
   L.Laf.
Then heres a man stands that has brought his pardon,


I would you had kneel'd my Lord to aske me mercy,


And that at my bidding you could so stand vp


   King.
I would I had, so I had broke thy pate


And askt thee mercy for't


   Laf.
Goodfaith a-crosse, but my good Lord 'tis thus,


Will you be cur'd of your infirmitie?
King.
No


   Laf.
O will you eat no grapes my royall foxe?
Yes but you will, my noble grapes, and if


My royall foxe could reach them: I haue seen a medicine


That's able to breath life into a stone,


Quicken a rocke, and make you dance Canari


With sprightly fire and motion, whose simple touch


Is powerfull to arayse King Pippen, nay


To giue great Charlemaine a pen in's hand


And write to her a loue-line


   King.
What her is this?
Laf.
Why doctor she: my Lord, there's one arriu'd,


If you will see her: now by my faith and honour,


If seriously I may conuay my thoughts


In this my light deliuerance, I haue spoke


With one, that in her sexe, her yeeres, profession,


Wisedome and constancy, hath amaz'd mee more


Then I dare blame my weakenesse: will you see her?
For that is her demand, and know her businesse?
That done, laugh well at me


   King.
Now good Lafew,


Bring in the admiration, that we with thee


May spend our wonder too, or take off thine


By wondring how thou tookst it


   Laf.
Nay, Ile fit you,


And not be all day neither


   King.
Thus he his speciall nothing euer prologues
   Laf.
Nay, come your waies.
Enter Hellen.
King.
This haste hath wings indeed
   Laf.
Nay, come your waies,


This is his Maiestie, say your minde to him,


A Traitor you doe looke like, but such traitors


His Maiesty seldome feares, I am Cresseds Vncle,


That dare leaue two together, far you well.
Enter.
King.
Now faire one, do's your busines follow vs?
Hel.
I my good Lord,


Gerard de Narbon was my father,


In what he did professe, well found


   King.
I knew him
   Hel.
The rather will I spare my praises towards him,


Knowing him is enough: on's bed of death,


Many receits he gaue me, chieflie one,


Which as the dearest issue of his practice


And of his olde experience, th' onlie darling,


He bad me store vp, as a triple eye,


Safer then mine owne two: more deare I haue so,


And hearing your high Maiestie is toucht


With that malignant cause, wherein the honour


Of my deare fathers gift, stands cheefe in power,


I come to tender it, and my appliance,


With all bound humblenesse


   King.
We thanke you maiden,


But may not be so credulous of cure,


When our most learned Doctors leaue vs, and


The congregated Colledge haue concluded,


That labouring Art can neuer ransome nature


From her inaydible estate: I say we must not


So staine our iudgement, or corrupt our hope,


To prostitute our past-cure malladie


To empericks, or to disseuer so


Our great selfe and our credit, to esteeme


A sencelesse helpe, when helpe past sence we deeme


   Hell.
My dutie then shall pay me for my paines:


I will no more enforce mine office on you,


Humbly intreating from your royall thoughts,


A modest one to beare me backe againe


   King.
I cannot giue thee lesse to be cal'd gratefull:


Thou thoughtst to helpe me, and such thankes I giue,


As one neere death to those that wish him liue:


But what at full I know, thou knowst no part,


I knowing all my perill, thou no Art


   Hell.
What I can doe, can doe no hurt to try,


Since you set vp your rest 'gainst remedie:


He that of greatest workes is finisher,


Oft does them by the weakest minister:


So holy Writ, in babes hath iudgement showne,


When Iudges haue bin babes; great flouds haue flowne


From simple sources: and great Seas haue dried


When Miracles haue by the great'st beene denied.
Oft expectation failes, and most oft there


Where most it promises: and oft it hits,


Where hope is coldest, and despaire most shifts


   King.
I must not heare thee, fare thee wel kind maide,


Thy paines not vs'd, must by thy selfe be paid,


Proffers not tooke, reape thanks for their reward


   Hel.
Inspired Merit so by breath is bard,


It is not so with him that all things knowes


As 'tis with vs, that square our guesse by showes:


But most it is presumption in vs, when


The help of heauen we count the act of men.
Deare sir, to my endeauors giue consent,


Of heauen, not me, make an experiment.
I am not an Imposture, that proclaime


My selfe against the leuill of mine aime,


But know I thinke, and thinke I know most sure,


My Art is not past power, nor you past cure


   King.
Art thou so confident?
Within what space


Hop'st thou my cure?
Hel.
The greatest grace lending grace,


Ere twice the horses of the sunne shall bring


Their fiery torcher his diurnall ring,


Ere twice in murke and occidentall dampe


Moist Hesperus hath quench'd her sleepy Lampe:


Or foure and twenty times the Pylots glasse


Hath told the theeuish minutes, how they passe:


What is infirme, from your sound parts shall flie,


Health shall liue free, and sickenesse freely dye


   King.
Vpon thy certainty and confidence,


What dar'st thou venter?
Hell.
Taxe of impudence,


A strumpets boldnesse, a divulged shame


Traduc'd by odious ballads: my maidens name


Seard otherwise, ne worse of worst extended


With vildest torture, let my life be ended


   Kin.
Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak


His powerfull sound, within an organ weake:


And what impossibility would slay


In common sence, sence saues another way:


Thy life is deere, for all that life can rate


Worth name of life, in thee hath estimate:


Youth, beauty, wisedome, courage, all


That happines and prime, can happy call:


Thou this to hazard, needs must intimate


Skill infinite, or monstrous desperate,


Sweet practiser, thy Physicke I will try,


That ministers thine owne death if I die


   Hel.
If I breake time, or flinch in property


Of what I spoke, vnpittied let me die,


And well deseru'd: not helping, death's my fee,


But if I helpe, what doe you promise me


   Kin.
Make thy demand
   Hel.
But will you make it euen?
Kin.
I by my Scepter, and my hopes of helpe


   Hel.
Then shalt thou giue me with thy kingly hand


What husband in thy power I will command:


Exempted be from me the arrogance


To choose from forth the royall bloud of France,


My low and humble name to propagate


With any branch or image of thy state:


But such a one thy vassall, whom I know


Is free for me to aske, thee to bestow


   Kin.
Heere is my hand, the premises obseru'd,


Thy will by my performance shall be seru'd:


So make the choice of thy owne time, for I


Thy resolv'd Patient, on thee still relye:


More should I question thee, and more I must,


Though more to know, could not be more to trust:


From whence thou cam'st, how tended on, but rest


Vnquestion'd welcome, and vndoubted blest.
Giue me some helpe heere hoa, if thou proceed,


As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.
Florish.
Exit.
Enter Countesse and Clowne.
Lady.
Come on sir, I shall now put you to the height


of your breeding


   Clown.
I will shew my selfe highly fed, and lowly


taught, I know my businesse is but to the Court


   Lady.
To the Court, why what place make you speciall,
when you put off that with such contempt, but to
the Court?
Clo.
Truly Madam, if God haue lent a man any manners,
hee may easilie put it off at Court: hee that cannot
make a legge, put off's cap, kisse his hand, and say nothing,
has neither legge, hands, lippe, nor cap; and indeed
such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
Court, but for me, I haue an answere will serue all men
   Lady.
Marry that's a bountifull answere that fits all
questions
   Clo.
It is like a Barbers chaire that fits all buttockes,
the pin buttocke, the quatch-buttocke, the brawn buttocke,
or any buttocke
   Lady.
Will your answere serue fit to all questions?
Clo.
As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an Atturney,
as your French Crowne for your taffety punke, as
Tibs rush for Toms fore-finger, as a pancake for Shroue-tuesday,
a Morris for May-day, as the naile to his hole,
the Cuckold to his horne, as a scolding queane to a
wrangling knaue, as the Nuns lip to the Friers mouth,
nay as the pudding to his skin
   Lady.
Haue you, I say, an answere of such fitnesse for


all questions?
Clo.
From below your Duke, to beneath your Constable,


it will fit any question


   Lady.
It must be an answere of most monstrous size,


that must fit all demands


   Clo.
But a triflle neither in good faith, if the learned
should speake truth of it: heere it is, and all that belongs
to't.
Aske mee if I am a Courtier, it shall doe you no
harme to learne
   Lady.
To be young againe if we could: I will bee a


foole in question, hoping to bee the wiser by your answer


   La.
I pray you sir, are you a Courtier?
Clo.
O Lord sir theres a simple putting off: more,


more, a hundred of them


   La.
Sir I am a poore freind of yours, that loues you
   Clo.
O Lord sir, thicke, thicke, spare not me
   La.
I thinke sir, you can eate none of this homely
meate
   Clo.
O Lord sir; nay put me too't, I warrant you
   La.
You were lately whipt sir as I thinke
   Clo.
O Lord sir, spare not me
   La.
Doe you crie O Lord sir at your whipping, and
spare not me?
Indeed your O Lord sir, is very sequent
to your whipping: you would answere very well to a
whipping if you were but bound too't
   Clo.
I nere had worse lucke in my life in my O Lord


sir: I see things may serue long, but not serue euer


   La.
I play the noble huswife with the time, to entertaine


it so merrily with a foole


   Clo.
O Lord sir, why there't serues well agen
   La.
And end sir to your businesse: giue Hellen this,


And vrge her to a present answer backe,


Commend me to my kinsmen, and my sonne,


This is not much


   Clo.
Not much commendation to them
   La.
Not much imployement for you, you vnderstand
me
   Clo.
Most fruitfully, I am there, before my legges
   La.
Hast you agen.
Exeunt.
Enter Count, Lafew, and Parolles.
Ol.Laf.
They say miracles are past, and we haue our
Philosophicall persons, to make moderne and familiar
things supernaturall and causelesse.
Hence is it, that we
make trifles of terrours, ensconcing our selues into seeming
knowledge, when we should submit our selues to
an vnknowne feare
   Par.
Why 'tis the rarest argument of wonder, that
hath shot out in our latter times
   Ros.
And so 'tis
   Ol.Laf.
To be relinquisht of the Artists
   Par.
So I say both of Galen and Paracelsus
   Ol.Laf.
Of all the learned and authenticke fellowes
   Par.
Right so I say
   Ol.Laf.
That gaue him out incureable
   Par.
Why there 'tis, so say I too
   Ol.Laf.
Not to be help'd
   Par.
Right, as 'twere a man assur'd of a-


  Ol.Laf.
Vncertaine life, and sure death


   Par.
Iust, you say well: so would I haue said
   Ol.Laf.
I may truly say, it is a noueltie to the world
   Par.
It is indeede if you will haue it in shewing, you


shall reade it in what do ye call there


   Ol.Laf.
A shewing of a heauenly effect in an earthly


Actor


   Par.
That's it, I would haue said, the verie same
   Ol.Laf.
Why your Dolphin is not lustier: fore mee


I speake in respect-


  Par.
Nay 'tis strange, 'tis very straunge, that is the


breefe and the tedious of it, and he's of a most facinerious


spirit, that will not acknowledge it to be the-


  Ol.Laf.
Very hand of heauen


   Par.
I, so I say
   Ol.Laf.
In a most weake-


  Par.
And debile minister great power, great trancendence,


which should indeede giue vs a further vse to


be made, then alone the recou'ry of the king, as to bee


  Old Laf.
Generally thankfull.
Enter King, Hellen, and attendants.
Par.
I would haue said it, you say well: heere comes


the King


   Ol.Laf.
Lustique, as the Dutchman saies: Ile like a
maide the Better whil'st I haue a tooth in my head: why
he's able to leade her a Carranto
   Par.
Mor du vinager, is not this Helen?
Ol.Laf.
Fore God I thinke so


   King.
Goe call before mee all the Lords in Court,


Sit my preseruer by thy patients side,


And with this healthfull hand whose banisht sence


Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receyue


The confirmation of my promis'd guift,


Which but attends thy naming.
Enter 3 or 4 Lords.
Faire Maide send forth thine eye, this youthfull parcell


Of Noble Batchellors, stand at my bestowing,


Ore whom both Soueraigne power, and fathers voice


I haue to vse; thy franke election make,


Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake


   Hel.
To each of you, one faire and vertuous Mistris;


Fall when loue please, marry to each but one


   Old Laf.
I'de giue bay curtall, and his furniture


My mouth no more were broken then these boyes,


And writ as little beard


   King.
Peruse them well:


Not one of those, but had a Noble father.
She addresses her to a Lord.
Hel.
Gentlemen, heauen hath through me, restor'd
the king to health
   All.
We vnderstand it, and thanke heauen for you
   Hel.
I am a simple Maide, and therein wealthiest


That I protest, I simply am a Maide:


Please it your Maiestie, I haue done already:


The blushes in my cheekes thus whisper mee,


We blush that thou shouldst choose, but be refused;


Let the white death sit on thy cheeke for euer,


Wee'l nere come there againe


   King.
Make choise and see,


Who shuns thy loue, shuns all his loue in mee


   Hel.
Now Dian from thy Altar do I fly,


And to imperiall loue, that God most high


Do my sighes streame: Sir, wil you heare my suite?
1.Lo.
And grant it


   Hel.
Thankes sir, all the rest is mute
   Ol.Laf.
I had rather be in this choise, then throw


Ames-ace for my life


   Hel.
The honor sir that flames in your faire eyes,


Before I speake too threatningly replies:


Loue make your fortunes twentie times aboue


Her that so wishes, and her humble loue


   2.Lo.
No better if you please
   Hel.
My wish receiue,


Which great loue grant, and so I take my leaue


   Ol.Laf.
Do all they denie her?
And they were sons
of mine, I'de haue them whip'd, or I would send them
to'th Turke to make Eunuches of
   Hel.
Be not afraid that I your hand should take,


Ile neuer do you wrong for your owne sake:


Blessing vpon your vowes, and in your bed


Finde fairer fortune, if you euer wed


   Old Laf.
These boyes are boyes of Ice, they'le none
haue heere: sure they are bastards to the English, the
French nere got em
   La.
You are too young, too happie, and too good


To make your selfe a sonne out of my blood


   4.Lord.
Faire one, I thinke not so
   Ol.Lord There's one grape yet, I am sure thy father
drunke wine.
But if thou be'st not an asse, I am a youth
of fourteene: I haue knowne thee already
   Hel.
I dare not say I take you, but I giue


Me and my seruice, euer whilst I liue


Into your guiding power: This is the man


   King.
Why then young Bertram take her shee's thy


wife


   Ber.
My wife my Leige?
I shal beseech your highnes


In such a busines, giue me leaue to vse


The helpe of mine owne eies


   King.
Know'st thou not Bertram what shee ha's


done for mee?
Ber.
Yes my good Lord, but neuer hope to know


why I should marrie her


   King.
Thou know'st shee ha's rais'd me from my sickly


bed


   Ber.
But followes it my Lord, to bring me downe


Must answer for your raising?
I knowe her well:


Shee had her breeding at my fathers charge:


A poore Physitians daughter my wife?
Disdaine


Rather corrupt me euer


   King.
Tis onely title thou disdainst in her, the which


I can build vp: strange is it that our bloods


Of colour, waight, and heat, pour'd all together,


Would quite confound distinction: yet stands off


In differences so mightie.
If she bee


All that is vertuous (saue what thou dislik'st)


A poore Phisitians daughter, thou dislik'st


Of vertue for the name: but doe not so:


From lowest place, whence vertuous things proceed,


The place is dignified by th' doers deede.
Where great additions swell's, and vertue none,


It is a dropsied honour.
Good alone,


Is good without a name?
Vilenesse is so:


The propertie by what is is, should go,


Not by the title.
Shee is young, wise, faire,


In these, to Nature shee's immediate heire:


And these breed honour: that is honours scorne,


Which challenges it selfe as honours borne,


And is not like the sire: Honours thriue,


When rather from our acts we them deriue


Then our fore-goers: the meere words, a slaue


Debosh'd on euerie tombe, on euerie graue:


A lying Trophee, and as oft is dumbe,


Where dust, and damn'd obliuion is the Tombe.
Of honour'd bones indeed, what should be saide?
If thou canst like this creature, as a maide,


I can create the rest: Vertue, and shee


Is her owne dower: Honour and wealth, from mee


   Ber.
I cannot loue her, nor will striue to doo't
   King.
Thou wrong'st thy selfe, if thou shold'st striue


to choose


   Hel.
That you are well restor'd my Lord, I'me glad:


Let the rest go


   King.
My Honor's at the stake, which to defeate


I must produce my power.
Heere, take her hand,


Proud scornfull boy, vnworthie this good gift,


That dost in vile misprision shackle vp


My loue, and her desert: that canst not dreame,


We poizing vs in her defectiue scale,


Shall weigh thee to the beame: That wilt not know,


It is in Vs to plant thine Honour, where


We please to haue it grow.
Checke thy contempt:


Obey Our will, which trauailes in thy good:


Beleeue not thy disdaine, but presentlie


Do thine owne fortunes that obedient right


Which both thy dutie owes, and Our power claimes,


Or I will throw thee from my care for euer


Into the staggers, and the carelesse lapse


Of youth and ignorance: both my reuenge and hate


Loosing vpon thee, in the name of iustice,


Without all termes of pittie.
Speake, thine answer


   Ber.
Pardon my gracious Lord: for I submit


My fancie to your eies, when I consider


What great creation, and what dole of honour


Flies where you bid it: I finde that she which late


Was in my Nobler thoughts, most base: is now


The praised of the King, who so ennobled,


Is as 'twere borne so


   King.
Take her by the hand,


And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise


A counterpoize: If not to thy estate,


A ballance more repleat


   Ber.
I take her hand
   Kin.
Good fortune, and the fauour of the King


Smile vpon this Contract: whose Ceremonie


Shall seeme expedient on the now borne briefe,


And be perform'd to night: the solemne Feast


Shall more attend vpon the coming space,


Expecting absent friends.
As thou lou'st her,


Thy loue's to me Religious: else, do's erre.
Exeunt.
Parolles and Lafew stay behind, commenting of this wedding.
Laf.
Do you heare Monsieur?
A word with you
   Par.
Your pleasure sir
   Laf.
Your Lord and Master did well to make his recantation
   Par.
Recantation?
My Lord?
my Master?
Laf.
I: Is it not a Language I speake?
Par.
A most harsh one, and not to bee vnderstoode


without bloudie succeeding.
My Master?
Laf.
Are you Companion to the Count Rosillion?
Par.
To any Count, to all Counts: to what is man


   Laf.
To what is Counts man: Counts maister is of


another stile


   Par.
You are too old sir: Let it satisfie you, you are


too old


   Laf.
I must tell thee sirrah, I write Man: to which


title age cannot bring thee


   Par.
What I dare too well do, I dare not do
   Laf.
I did thinke thee for two ordinaries: to bee a
prettie wise fellow, thou didst make tollerable vent of
thy trauell, it might passe: yet the scarffes and the bannerets
about thee, did manifoldlie disswade me from beleeuing
thee a vessell of too great a burthen.
I haue now
found thee, when I loose thee againe, I care not: yet art
thou good for nothing but taking vp, and that th'ourt
scarce worth
   Par.
Hadst thou not the priuiledge of Antiquity vpon
thee
   Laf.
Do not plundge thy selfe to farre in anger, least
thou hasten thy triall: which if, Lord haue mercie on
thee for a hen, so my good window of Lettice fare thee
well, thy casement I neede not open, for I look through
thee.
Giue me thy hand
   Par.
My Lord, you giue me most egregious indignity
   Laf.
I with all my heart, and thou art worthy of it
   Par.
I haue not my Lord deseru'd it
   Laf.
Yes good faith, eu'ry dramme of it, and I will
not bate thee a scruple
   Par.
Well, I shall be wiser
   Laf.
Eu'n as soone as thou can'st, for thou hast to pull
at a smacke a'th contrarie.
If euer thou bee'st bound
in thy skarfe and beaten, thou shall finde what it is to be
proud of thy bondage, I haue a desire to holde my acquaintance
with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I
may say in the default, he is a man I know
   Par.
My Lord you do me most insupportable vexation
   Laf.
I would it were hell paines for thy sake, and my
poore doing eternall: for doing I am past, as I will by
thee, in what motion age will giue me leaue.
Enter.
Par.
Well, thou hast a sonne shall take this disgrace
off me; scuruy, old, filthy, scuruy Lord: Well, I must
be patient, there is no fettering of authority.
Ile beate
him (by my life) if I can meete him with any conuenience,
and he were double and double a Lord.
Ile haue
no more pittie of his age then I would haue of- Ile
beate him, and if I could but meet him agen.
Enter Lafew.
Laf.
Sirra, your Lord and masters married, there's
newes for you: you haue a new Mistris
   Par.
I most vnfainedly beseech your Lordshippe to
make some reseruation of your wrongs.
He is my good
Lord, whom I serue aboue is my master
   Laf.
Who?
God
   Par.
I sir
   Laf.
The deuill it is, that's thy master.
Why dooest
thou garter vp thy armes a this fashion?
Dost make hose
of thy sleeues?
Do other seruants so?
Thou wert best set
thy lower part where thy nose stands.
By mine Honor,
if I were but two houres yonger, I'de beate thee: mee-think'st
thou art a generall offence, and euery man shold
beate thee: I thinke thou wast created for men to breath
themselues vpon thee
   Par.
This is hard and vndeserued measure my Lord
   Laf.
Go too sir, you were beaten in Italy for picking
a kernell out of a Pomgranat, you are a vagabond, and
no true traueller: you are more sawcie with Lordes and
honourable personages, then the Commission of your
birth and vertue giues you Heraldry.
You are not worth
another word, else I'de call you knaue.
I leaue you.
Exit
Enter Count Rossillion.
Par.
Good, very good, it is so then: good, very
good, let it be conceal'd awhile
   Ros.
Vndone, and forfeited to cares for euer
   Par.
What's the matter sweet-heart?
Rossill.
Although before the solemne Priest I haue


sworne, I will not bed her


   Par.
What?
what sweet heart?
Ros.
O my Parrolles, they haue married me:


Ile to the Tuscan warres, and neuer bed her


   Par.
France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits,


The tread of a mans foot: too'th warres


   Ros.
There's letters from my mother: What th' import


is, I know not yet


   Par.
I that would be knowne: too'th warrs my boy,


too'th warres:


He weares his honor in a boxe vnseene,


That hugges his kickie wickie heare at home,


Spending his manlie marrow in her armes


Which should sustaine the bound and high curuet


Of Marses fierie steed: to other Regions,


France is a stable, wee that dwell in't Iades,


Therefore too'th warre


   Ros.
It shall be so, Ile send her to my house,


Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,


And wherefore I am fled: Write to the King


That which I durst not speake.
His present gift


Shall furnish me to those Italian fields


Where noble fellowes strike: Warres is no strife


To the darke house, and the detected wife


   Par.
Will this Caprichio hold in thee, art sure?
Ros.
Go with me to my chamber, and aduice me.
Ile send her straight away: To morrow,


Ile to the warres, she to her single sorrow


   Par.
Why these bals bound, ther's noise in it.
Tis hard


A yong man maried, is a man that's mard:


Therefore away, and leaue her brauely: go,


The King ha's done you wrong: but hush 'tis so.
Exit
Enter Helena and Clowne.
Hel.
My mother greets me kindly, is she well?
Clo.
She is not well, but yet she has her health, she's
very merrie, but yet she is not well: but thankes be giuen
she's very well, and wants nothing i'th world: but
yet she is not well
   Hel.
If she be verie wel, what do's she ayle, that she's


not verie well?
Clo.
Truly she's very well indeed, but for two things


  Hel.
What two things?
Clo.
One, that she's not in heauen, whether God send


her quickly: the other, that she's in earth, from whence


God send her quickly.
Enter Parolles.
Par.
Blesse you my fortunate Ladie
   Hel.
I hope sir I haue your good will to haue mine


owne good fortune


   Par.
You had my prayers to leade them on, and to


keepe them on, haue them still.
O my knaue, how do's


my old Ladie?
Clo.
So that you had her wrinkles, and I her money,


I would she did as you say


   Par.
Why I say nothing
   Clo.
Marry you are the wiser man: for many a mans
tongue shakes out his masters vndoing: to say nothing,
to do nothing, to know nothing, and to haue nothing,
is to be a great part of your title, which is within a verie
little of nothing
   Par.
Away, th'art a knaue
   Clo.
You should haue said sir before a knaue, th'art a
knaue, that's before me th'art a knaue: this had beene
truth sir
   Par.
Go too, thou art a wittie foole, I haue found
thee
   Clo.
Did you finde me in your selfe sir, or were you
taught to finde me?
Clo.
The search sir was profitable, and much Foole
may you find in you, euen to the worlds pleasure, and the
encrease of laughter
   Par.
A good knaue ifaith, and well fed.
Madam, my Lord will go awaie to night,


A verie serrious businesse call's on him:


The great prerogatiue and rite of loue,


Which as your due time claimes, he do's acknowledge,


But puts it off to a compell'd restraint:


Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets


Which they distill now in the curbed time,


To make the comming houre oreflow with ioy,


And pleasure drowne the brim


   Hel.
What's his will else?
Par.
That you will take your instant leaue a'th king,


And make this hast as your owne good proceeding,


Strengthned with what Apologie you thinke


May make it probable neede


   Hel.
What more commands hee?
Par.
That hauing this obtain'd, you presentlie


Attend his further pleasure


   Hel.
In euery thing I waite vpon his will
   Par.
I shall report it so.
Exit Par.
Hell.
I pray you come sirrah.
Exit
Enter Lafew and Bertram.
Laf.
But I hope your Lordshippe thinkes not him a
souldier
   Ber.
Yes my Lord and of verie valiant approofe
   Laf.
You haue it from his owne deliuerance
   Ber.
And by other warranted testimonie
   Laf.
Then my Diall goes not true, I tooke this Larke


for a bunting


   Ber.
I do assure you my Lord he is very great in knowledge,


and accordinglie valiant


   Laf.
I haue then sinn'd against his experience, and
transgrest against his valour, and my state that way is
dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent:
Heere he comes, I pray you make vs freinds, I will pursue
the amitie.
Enter Parolles.
Par.
These things shall be done sir
   Laf.
Pray you sir whose his Tailor?
Par.
Sir?
Laf.
O I know him well, I sir, hee sirs a good workeman,


a verie good Tailor


   Ber.
Is shee gone to the king?
Par.
Shee is


   Ber.
Will shee away to night?
Par.
As you'le haue her


   Ber.
I haue writ my letters, casketted my treasure,


Giuen order for our horses, and to night,


When I should take possession of the Bride,


And ere I doe begin


   Laf.
A good Trauailer is something at the latter end
of a dinner, but on that lies three thirds, and vses a
known truth to passe a thousand nothings with, should
bee once hard, and thrice beaten.
God saue you Captaine
   Ber.
Is there any vnkindnes betweene my Lord and


you Monsieur?
Par.
I know not how I haue deserued to run into my


Lords displeasure


   Laf.
You haue made shift to run into't, bootes and
spurres and all: like him that leapt into the Custard, and
out of it you'le runne againe, rather then suffer question
for your residence
   Ber.
It may bee you haue mistaken him my Lord
   Laf.
And shall doe so euer, though I tooke him at's
prayers.
Fare you well my Lord, and beleeue this of
me, there can be no kernell in this light Nut: the soule
of this man is his cloathes: Trust him not in matter of
heauie consequence: I haue kept of them tame, & know
their natures.
Farewell Monsieur, I haue spoken better
of you, then you haue or will to deserue at my hand, but
we must do good against euill
   Par.
An idle Lord, I sweare
   Ber.
I thinke so
   Par.
Why do you not know him?
Ber.
Yes, I do know him well, and common speech


Giues him a worthy passe.
Heere comes my clog.
Enter Helena.
Hel.
I haue sir as I was commanded from you


Spoke with the King, and haue procur'd his leaue


For present parting, onely he desires


Some priuate speech with you


   Ber.
I shall obey his will.
You must not meruaile Helen at my course,


Which holds not colour with the time, nor does


The ministration, and required office


On my particular.
Prepar'd I was not


For such a businesse, therefore am I found


So much vnsetled: This driues me to intreate you,


That presently you take your way for home,


And rather muse then aske why I intreate you,


For my respects are better then they seeme,


And my appointments haue in them a neede


Greater then shewes it selfe at the first view,


To you that know them not.
This to my mother,


'Twill be two daies ere I shall see you, so


I leaue you to your wisedome


   Hel.
Sir, I can nothing say,


But that I am your most obedient seruant


   Ber.
Come, come, no more of that
   Hel.
And euer shall


With true obseruance seeke to eeke out that


Wherein toward me my homely starres haue faild


To equall my great fortune


   Ber.
Let that goe: my hast is verie great.
Farwell:


Hie home


   Hel.
Pray sir your pardon
   Ber.
Well, what would you say?
Hel.
I am not worthie of the wealth I owe,


Nor dare I say 'tis mine: and yet it is,


But like a timorous theefe, most faine would steale


What law does vouch mine owne


   Ber.
What would you haue?
Hel.
Something, and scarse so much: nothing indeed,


I would not tell you what I would my Lord: Faith yes,


Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kisse


   Ber.
I pray you stay not, but in hast to horse
   Hel.
I shall not breake your bidding, good my Lord:


Where are my other men?
Monsieur, farwell.
Exit
  Ber.
Go thou toward home, where I wil neuer come,


Whilst I can shake my sword, or heare the drumme:


Away, and for our flight

Souldiers.
Duke.
So that from point to point, now haue you heard


The fundamentall reasons of this warre,


Whose great decision hath much blood let forth


And more thirsts after


   1.Lord.
Holy seemes the quarrell
Vpon your Graces part: blacke and fearefull
On the opposer
   Duke.
Therefore we meruaile much our Cosin France


Would in so iust a businesse, shut his bosome


Against our borrowing prayers


   French E. Good my Lord,


The reasons of our state I cannot yeelde,


But like a common and an outward man,


That the great figure of a Counsaile frames,


By selfe vnable motion, therefore dare not


Say what I thinke of it, since I haue found


My selfe in my incertaine grounds to faile


As often as I guest


   Duke.
Be it his pleasure
   Fren.G.
But I am sure the yonger of our nature,


That surfet on their ease, will day by day


Come heere for Physicke


   Duke.
Welcome shall they bee:


And all the honors that can flye from vs,


Shall on them settle: you know your places well,


When better fall, for your auailes they fell,


To morrow to'th the field.

Count.
It hath happen'd all, as I would haue had it, saue

   Clo.
By my troth I take my young Lord to be a verie


melancholly man


   Count.
By what obseruance I pray you
   Clo.
Why he will looke vppon his boote, and sing:
mend the Ruffe and sing, aske questions and sing, picke
his teeth, and sing: I know a man that had this tricke of
melancholy hold a goodly Mannor for a song
   Lad.
Let me see what he writes, and when he meanes
to come
   Clow.
I haue no minde to Isbell since I was at Court.
Our old Lings, and our Isbels a'th Country, are nothing
like your old Ling and your Isbels a'th Court: the brains
of my Cupid's knock'd out, and I beginne to loue, as an
old man loues money, with no stomacke
   Lad.
What haue we heere?
Clo.
In that you haue there.

A Letter.
I haue sent you a daughter-in-Law, shee hath recouered the

You shall heare I am
runne away, know it before the report come.
If there bee
bredth enough in the world, I will hold a long distance.
My
duty to you.
Your vnfortunate sonne,
Bertram.
This is not well rash and vnbridled boy,
To flye the fauours of so good a King,
To plucke his indignation on thy head,
By the misprising of a Maide too vertuous
For the contempt of Empire.
Enter Clowne.
Clow.
O Madam, yonder is heauie newes within betweene
two souldiers, and my yong Ladie
   La.
What is the matter
   Clo.
Nay there is some comfort in the newes, some
comfort, your sonne will not be kild so soone as I thoght
he would
   La.
Why should he be kill'd?
Clo.
So say I Madame, if he runne away, as I heare he
does, the danger is in standing too't, that's the losse of
men, though it be the getting of children.
Heere they
come will tell you more.
For my part I onely heare your
sonne was run away.
Enter Hellen and two Gentlemen.
French E. Saue you good Madam

   French G. Do not say so
   La.
Thinke vpon patience, pray you Gentlemen,


I haue felt so many quirkes of ioy and greefe,


That the first face of neither on the start


Can woman me vntoo't.
Where is my sonne I pray you?
Fren.G.
Madam he's gone to serue the Duke of Florence,


We met him thitherward, for thence we came:


And after some dispatch in hand at Court,


Thither we bend againe


   Hel.
Looke on his Letter Madam, here's my Pasport.
When thou canst get the Ring vpon my finger, which neuer
shall come off, and shew mee a childe begotten of thy bodie,

for our paines


   Old La.
I prethee Ladie haue a better cheere,


If thou engrossest, all the greefes are thine,

But I do wash his name out of my blood,


And thou art all my childe.
Towards Florence is he?
Fren.G.

   La.
And to be a souldier
   Fren.G.
Such is his noble purpose, and beleeu't


The Duke will lay vpon him all the honor


That good conuenience claimes

Returne you thither

   Hel.
Till I haue no wife, I haue nothing in France,


'Tis bitter


   La.
Finde you that there?
Hel.
I Madame


   Fren.E.
'Tis but the boldnesse of his hand haply, which


his heart was not consenting too


   Lad.
Nothing in France, vntill he haue no wife:


There's nothing heere that is too good for him


But onely she, and she deserues a Lord


That twenty such rude boyes might tend vpon,


And call her hourely Mistris.
Who was with him?
Fren.E.
A seruant onely, and a Gentleman: which I


haue sometime knowne


   La.
Parolles was it not?
Fren.E.
I my good Ladie, hee


   La.
A verie tainted fellow, and full of wickednesse,


My sonne corrupts a well deriued nature


With his inducement

Indeed good Ladie the fellow has a deale of


that, too much, which holds him much to haue


   La.
Y'are welcome Gentlemen, I will intreate you
when you see my sonne, to tell him that his sword can
neuer winne the honor that he looses: more Ile intreate

We serue you Madam in that and all your


worthiest affaires

Not so, but as we change our courtesies,


Will you draw neere?

Till I haue no wife I haue nothing in France.

Thou shalt haue none Rossillion, none in France,


Then hast thou all againe: poore Lord, is't I


That chase thee from thy Countrie, and expose


Those tender limbes of thine, to the euent


Of the none-sparing warre?
And is it I,


That driue thee from the sportiue Court, where thou


Was't shot at with faire eyes, to be the marke


Of smoakie Muskets?
O you leaden messengers,


That ride vpon the violent speede of fire,


Fly with false ayme, moue the still-peering aire


That sings with piercing, do not touch my Lord:


Who euer shoots at him, I set him there.
Who euer charges on his forward brest


I am the Caitiffe that do hold him too't,


And though I kill him not, I am the cause


His death was so effected: Better 'twere


I met the rauine Lyon when he roar'd


With sharpe constraint of hunger: better 'twere,


That all the miseries which nature owes


Were mine at once.
No come thou home Rossillion,


Whence honor but of danger winnes a scarre,


As oft it looses all.
I will be gone:


My being heere it is, that holds thee hence,


Shall I stay heere to doo't?
No, no, although


The ayre of Paradise did fan the house,


And Angels offic'd all: I will be gone,


That pittifull rumour may report my flight


To consolate thine eare.
Come night, end day,


For with the darke (poore theefe) Ile steale away.

He is too good and faire for death, and mee,

Is deerest to me, I haue no skill in sence


To make distinction: prouide this Messenger:


My heart is heauie, and mine age is weake,


Greefe would haue teares, and sorrow bids me speake.
Exeunt.
A Tucket afarre off.
Enter old Widdow of Florence, her daughter Violenta and
Mariana, with
other Citizens.
Widdow.
Nay come,


For if they do approach the Citty,


We shall loose all the sight


   Diana.
They say, the French Count has done


Most honourable seruice


   Wid.
It is reported,


That he has taken their great'st Commander,


And that with his owne hand he slew


The Dukes brother: we haue lost our labour,


They are gone a contrarie way: harke,


you may know by their Trumpets


   Maria.
Come lets returne againe,


And suffice our selues with the report of it.
Well Diana, take heed of this French Earle,


The honor of a Maide is her name,


And no Legacie is so rich


As honestie


   Widdow.
I haue told my neighbour


How you haue beene solicited by a Gentleman


His Companion


   Maria.
I know that knaue, hang him, one Parolles,
a filthy Officer he is in those suggestions for the young
Earle, beware of them Diana; their promises, entisements,
oathes, tokens, and all these engines of lust, are
not the things they go vnder: many a maide hath beene
seduced by them, and the miserie is example, that so
terrible shewes in the wracke of maiden-hood, cannot
for all that disswade succession, but that they are limed
with the twigges that threatens them.
I hope I neede
not to aduise you further, but I hope your owne grace
will keepe you where you are, though there were no
further danger knowne, but the modestie which is so
lost
   Dia.
You shall not neede to feare me.
Enter Hellen.
Wid.
I hope so: looke here comes a pilgrim, I know


she will lye at my house, thither they send one another,


Ile question her.
God saue you pilgrim, whether are


bound?
Hel.
To S[aint].
Iaques la grand.
Where do the Palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
Wid.
At the S[aint].
Francis heere beside the Port


   Hel.
Is this the way?
A march afarre.
Wid.
I marrie ist.
Harke you, they come this way:


If you will tarrie holy Pilgrime


But till the troopes come by,


I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd,


The rather for I thinke I know your hostesse


As ample as my selfe


   Hel.
Is it your selfe?
Wid.
If you shall please so Pilgrime


   Hel.
I thanke you, and will stay vpon your leisure
   Wid.
You came I thinke from France?
Hel.
I did so


   Wid.
Heere you shall see a Countriman of yours


That has done worthy seruice


   Hel.
His name I pray you?
Dia.
The Count Rossillion: know you such a one?
Hel.
But by the eare that heares most nobly of him:


His face I know not


   Dia.
What somere he is


He's brauely taken heere.
He stole from France


As 'tis reported: for the King had married him


Against his liking.
Thinke you it is so?
Hel.
I surely meere the truth, I know his Lady


   Dia.
There is a Gentleman that serues the Count,


Reports but coursely of her


   Hel.
What's his name?
Dia.
Monsieur Parrolles


   Hel.
Oh I beleeue with him,


In argument of praise, or to the worth


Of the great Count himselfe, she is too meane


To haue her name repeated, all her deseruing


Is a reserued honestie, and that


I haue not heard examin'd


   Dian.
Alas poore Ladie,


'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife


Of a detesting Lord


   Wid.
I write good creature, wheresoere she is,


Her hart waighes sadly: this yong maid might do her


A shrewd turne if she pleas'd


   Hel.
How do you meane?
May be the amorous Count solicites her


In the vnlawfull purpose


   Wid.
He does indeede,


And brokes with all that can in such a suite


Corrupt the tender honour of a Maide:


But she is arm'd for him, and keepes her guard


In honestest defence.
Drumme and Colours.
Enter Count Rossillion, Parrolles, and the


whole


Armie.
Mar.
The goddes forbid else
   Wid.
So, now they come:


That is Anthonio the Dukes eldest sonne,


That Escalus


   Hel.
Which is the Frenchman?
Dia.
Hee,


That with the plume, 'tis a most gallant fellow,


I would he lou'd his wife: if he were honester


He were much goodlier.
Is't not a handsom Gentleman


  Hel.
I like him well


   Di.
'Tis pitty he is not honest: yonds that same knaue


That leades him to these places: were I his Ladie,


I would poison that vile Rascall


   Hel.
Which is he?
Dia.
That Iacke-an-apes with scarfes.
Why is hee


melancholly?
Hel.
Perchance he's hurt i'th battaile


   Par.
Loose our drum?
Well
   Mar.
He's shrewdly vext at something.
Looke he
has spyed vs
   Wid.
Marrie hang you
   Mar.
And your curtesie, for a ring-carrier.
Enter.
Wid.
The troope is past: Come pilgrim, I wil bring


you, Where you shall host: Of inioyn'd penitents


There's foure or fiue, to great S[aint].
Iaques bound,


Alreadie at my house


   Hel.
I humbly thanke you:


Please it this Matron, and this gentle Maide


To eate with vs to night, the charge and thanking


Shall be for me, and to requite you further,


I will bestow some precepts of this Virgin,


Worthy the note


   Both.
Wee'l take your offer kindly.
Exeunt.
Enter Count Rossillion and the Frenchmen, as at first.
Cap.E.
Nay good my Lord put him too't: let him


haue his way


   Cap.G.
If your Lordshippe finde him not a Hilding,


hold me no more in your respect


   Cap.E.
On my life my Lord, a bubble
   Ber.
Do you thinke I am so farre


Deceiued in him


   Cap.E.
Beleeue it my Lord, in mine owne direct
knowledge, without any malice, but to speake of him
as my kinsman, hee's a most notable Coward, an infinite
and endlesse Lyar, an hourely promise-breaker, the
owner of no one good qualitie, worthy your Lordships
entertainment
   Cap.G.
It were fit you knew him, least reposing too
farre in his vertue which he hath not, he might at some
great and trustie businesse, in a maine daunger, fayle
you
   Ber.
I would I knew in what particular action to try
him
   Cap.G.
None better then to let him fetch off his
drumme, which you heare him so confidently vndertake
to do
   C.E.
I with a troop of Florentines wil sodainly surprize
him; such I will haue whom I am sure he knowes
not from the enemie: wee will binde and hoodwinke
him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried
into the Leager of the aduersaries, when we bring
him to our owne tents: be but your Lordship present
at his examination, if he do not for the promise of his
life, and in the highest compulsion of base feare, offer to
betray you, and deliuer all the intelligence in his power
against you, and that with the diuine forfeite of his
soule vpon oath, neuer trust my iudgement in anie
thing
   Cap.G.
O for the loue of laughter, let him fetch his
drumme, he sayes he has a stratagem for't: when your
Lordship sees the bottome of this successe in't, and to
what mettle this counterfeyt lump of ours will be melted
if you giue him not Iohn drummes entertainement,
your inclining cannot be remoued.
Heere he comes.
Enter Parrolles.
Cap.E.
O for the loue of laughter hinder not the honor
of his designe, let him fetch off his drumme in any
hand
   Ber.
How now Monsieur?
This drumme sticks sorely
in your disposition
   Cap.G.
A pox on't, let it go, 'tis but a drumme
   Par.
But a drumme: Ist but a drumme?
A drum so
lost.
There was excellent command, to charge in with
our horse vpon our owne wings, and to rend our owne
souldiers
   Cap.G.
That was not to be blam'd in the command
of the seruice: it was a disaster of warre that Cćsar him
selfe could not haue preuented, if he had beene there to
command
   Ber.
Well, wee cannot greatly condemne our successe:
some dishonor wee had in the losse of that drum,
but it is not to be recouered
   Par.
It might haue beene recouered
   Ber.
It might, but it is not now
   Par.
It is to be recouered, but that the merit of seruice
is sildome attributed to the true and exact performer,
I would haue that drumme or another, or hic iacet
   Ber.
Why if you haue a stomacke, too't Monsieur: if
you thinke your mysterie in stratagem, can bring this
instrument of honour againe into his natiue quarter, be
magnanimious in the enterprize and go on, I wil grace
the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speede well in
it, the Duke shall both speake of it, and extend to you
what further becomes his greatnesse, euen to the vtmost
syllable of your worthinesse
   Par.
By the hand of a souldier I will vndertake it
   Ber.
But you must not now slumber in it
   Par.
Ile about it this euening, and I will presently
pen downe my dilemma's, encourage my selfe in my
certaintie, put my selfe into my mortall preparation:
and by midnight looke to heare further from me
   Ber.
May I bee bold to acquaint his grace you are


gone about it


   Par.
I know not what the successe wil be my Lord,


but the attempt I vow


   Ber.
I know th'art valiant,


And to the possibility of thy souldiership,


Will subscribe for thee: Farewell


   Par.
I loue not many words.
Exit
  Cap.E.
No more then a fish loues water.
Is not this
a strange fellow my Lord, that so confidently seemes to
vndertake this businesse, which he knowes is not to be
done, damnes himselfe to do, & dares better be damnd
then to doo't
   Cap.G.
You do not know him my Lord as we doe,
certaine it is that he will steale himselfe into a mans fauour,
and for a weeke escape a great deale of discoueries,
but when you finde him out, you haue him euer after
   Ber.
Why do you thinke he will make no deede at
all of this that so seriouslie hee dooes addresse himselfe
vnto?
Cap.E.
None in the world, but returne with an inuention,
and clap vpon you two or three probable lies:
but we haue almost imbost him, you shall see his fall to
night; for indeede he is not for your Lordshippes respect
   Cap.G.
Weele make you some sport with the Foxe
ere we case him.
He was first smoak'd by the old Lord
Lafew, when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what
a sprat you shall finde him, which you shall see this verie
night
   Cap.E.
I must go looke my twigges,


He shall be caught


   Ber.
Your brother he shall go along with me
   Cap.G.
As't please your Lordship, Ile leaue you
   Ber.
Now wil I lead you to the house, and shew you


The Lasse I spoke of


   Cap.E.
But you say she's honest
   Ber.
That's all the fault: I spoke with hir but once,


And found her wondrous cold, but I sent to her


By this same Coxcombe that we haue i'th winde


Tokens and Letters, which she did resend,


And this is all I haue done: She's a faire creature,


Will you go see her?
Cap.E.
With all my heart my Lord.
Exeunt.
Enter Hellen, and Widdow.
Hel.
If you misdoubt me that I am not shee,


I know not how I shall assure you further,


But I shall loose the grounds I worke vpon


   Wid.
Though my estate be falne, I was well borne,


Nothing acquainted with these businesses,


And would not put my reputation now


In any staining act


   Hel.
Nor would I wish you.
First giue me trust, the Count he is my husband,


And what to your sworne counsaile I haue spoken,


Is so from word to word: and then you cannot


By the good ayde that I of you shall borrow,


Erre in bestowing it


   Wid.
I should beleeue you,


For you haue shew'd me that which well approues


Y'are great in fortune


   Hel.
Take this purse of Gold,


And let me buy your friendly helpe thus farre,


Which I will ouer-pay, and pay againe


When I haue found it.
The Count he woes your


daughter,


Layes downe his wanton siedge before her beautie,


Resolue to carrie her: let her in fine consent


As wee'l direct her how 'tis best to beare it:


Now his important blood will naught denie,


That shee'l demand: a ring the Countie weares,


That downward hath succeeded in his house


From sonne to sonne, some foure or fiue discents,


Since the first father wore it.
This Ring he holds


In most rich choice: yet in his idle fire,


To buy his will, it would not seeme too deere,


How ere repented after


   Wid.
Now I see the bottome of your purpose
   Hel.
You see it lawfull then, it is no more,


But that your daughter ere she seemes as wonne,


Desires this Ring; appoints him an encounter;


In fine, deliuers me to fill the time,


Her selfe most chastly absent: after


To marry her, Ile adde three thousand Crownes


To what is past already


   Wid.
I haue yeelded:


Instruct my daughter how she shall perseuer,


That time and place with this deceite so lawfull


May proue coherent.
Euery night he comes


With Musickes of all sorts, and songs compos'd


To her vnworthinesse: It nothing steeds vs


To chide him from our eeues, for he persists


As if his life lay on't


   Hel.
Why then to night


Let vs assay our plot, which if it speed,


Is wicked meaning in a lawfull deede;


And lawfull meaning in a lawfull act,


Where both not sinne, and yet a sinfull fact.
But let's about it.
Actus Quartus.
Enter one of the Frenchmen, with fiue or sixe other souldiers in
ambush.
Lord E. He can come no other way but by this hedge
corner: when you sallie vpon him, speake what terrible
Language you will: though you vnderstand it not your
selues, no matter: for we must not seeme to vnderstand
him, vnlesse some one among vs, whom wee must produce
for an Interpreter
   1.Sol.
Good Captaine, let me be th' Interpreter
   Lor.E.
Art not acquainted with him?
knowes he not


thy voice?
1.Sol.
No sir I warrant you


   Lo.E.
But what linsie wolsy hast thou to speake to vs


againe


   1.Sol.
E'n such as you speake to me
   Lo.E.
He must thinke vs some band of strangers, i'th
aduersaries entertainment.
Now he hath a smacke of all
neighbouring Languages: therefore we must euery one
be a man of his owne fancie, not to know what we speak
one to another: so we seeme to know, is to know straight
our purpose: Choughs language, gabble enough, and
good enough.
As for you interpreter, you must seeme
very politicke.
But couch hoa, heere hee comes, to beguile
two houres in a sleepe, and then to returne & swear
the lies he forges.
Enter Parrolles.
Par.
Ten a clocke: Within these three houres 'twill
be time enough to goe home.
What shall I say I haue
done?
It must bee a very plausiue inuention that carries
it.
They beginne to smoake mee, and disgraces haue of
late, knock'd too often at my doore: I finde my tongue
is too foole-hardie, but my heart hath the feare of Mars
before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of
my tongue
   Lo.E.
This is the first truth that ere thine own tongue
was guiltie of
   Par.
What the diuell should moue mee to vndertake
the recouerie of this drumme, being not ignorant of the
impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose?
I
must giue my selfe some hurts, and say I got them in exploit:
yet slight ones will not carrie it.
They will say,
came you off with so little?
And great ones I dare not
giue, wherefore what's the instance.
Tongue, I must put
you into a Butter-womans mouth, and buy my selfe another
of Baiazeths Mule, if you prattle mee into these
perilles
   Lo.E.
Is it possible he should know what hee is, and


be that he is


   Par.
I would the cutting of my garments wold serue


the turne, or the breaking of my Spanish sword


   Lo.E.
We cannot affoord you so
   Par.
Or the baring of my beard, and to say it was in
stratagem
   Lo.E.
'Twould not do
   Par.
Or to drowne my cloathes, and say I was stript
   Lo.E.
Hardly serue
   Par.
Though I swore I leapt from the window of the


Citadell


   Lo.E.
How deepe?
Par.
Thirty fadome


   Lo.E.
Three great oathes would scarse make that be


beleeued


   Par.
I would I had any drumme of the enemies, I


would sweare I recouer'd it


   Lo.E.
You shall heare one anon
   Par.
A drumme now of the enemies.
Alarum within.
Lo.E.
Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo
   All.
Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo
   Par.
O ransome, ransome,


Do not hide mine eyes


   Inter.
Boskos thromuldo boskos
   Par.
I know you are the Muskos Regiment,


And I shall loose my life for want of language.
If there be heere German or Dane, Low Dutch,


Italian, or French, let him speake to me,


Ile discouer that, which shal vndo the Florentine


   Int.
Boskos vauvado, I vnderstand thee, & can speake

Oh pray, pray, pray,


Manka reuania dulche


   Lo.E.
Oscorbidulchos voliuorco
   Int.
The Generall is content to spare thee yet,


And hoodwinkt as thou art, will leade thee on


To gather from thee.
Haply thou mayst informe


Something to saue thy life


   Par.
O let me liue,


And all the secrets of our campe Ile shew,


Their force, their purposes: Nay, Ile speake that,


Which you will wonder at


   Inter.
But wilt thou faithfully?
Par.
If I do not, damne me


   Inter.
Acordo linta.
Come on, thou are granted space.
Exit
A short Alarum within.
L.E.
Go tell the Count Rossillion and my brother,


We haue caught the woodcocke, and will keepe him mufled


Till we do heare from them


   Sol.
Captaine I will
   L.E.
A will betray vs all vnto our selues,


Informe on that


   Sol.
So I will sir
   L.E.
Till then Ile keepe him darke and safely lockt.
Exit
Enter Bertram, and the Maide called Diana.
Ber.
They told me that your name was Fontybell
   Dia.
No my good Lord, Diana
   Ber.
Titled Goddesse,


And worth it with addition: but faire soule,


In your fine frame hath loue no qualitie?
If the quicke fire of youth light not your minde,


You are no Maiden but a monument


When you are dead you should be such a one


As you are now: for you are cold and sterne,


And now you should be as your mother was


When your sweet selfe was got


   Dia.
She then was honest
   Ber.
So should you be
   Dia.
No:


My mother did but dutie, such (my Lord)


As you owe to your wife


   Ber.
No more a'that:


I prethee do not striue against my vowes:


I was compell'd to her, but I loue thee


By loues owne sweet constraint, and will for euer


Do thee all rights of seruice


   Dia.
I so you serue vs


Till we serue you: But when you haue our Roses,


You barely leaue our thornes to pricke our selues,


And mocke vs with our barenesse


   Ber.
How haue I sworne
   Dia.
Tis not the many oathes that makes the truth,


But the plaine single vow, that is vow'd true:


What is not holie, that we sweare not by,


But take the high'st to witnesse: then pray you tell me,


If I should sweare by Ioues great attributes,


I lou'd you deerely, would you beleeue my oathes,


When I did loue you ill?
This ha's no holding


To sweare by him whom I protest to loue


That I will worke against him.
Therefore your oathes


Are words and poore conditions, but vnseal'd


At lest in my opinion


   Ber.
Change it, change it:


Be not so holy cruell: Loue is holie,


And my integritie ne're knew the crafts


That you do charge men with: Stand no more off,


But giue thy selfe vnto my sicke desires,


Who then recouers.
Say thou art mine, and euer


My loue as it beginnes, shall so perseuer


   Dia.
I see that men make rope's in such a scarre,


That wee'l forsake our selues.
Giue me that Ring


   Ber.
Ile lend it thee my deere; but haue no power


To giue it from me


   Dia.
Will you not my Lord?
Ber.
It is an honour longing to our house,


Bequeathed downe from manie Ancestors,


Which were the greatest obloquie i'th world,


In me to loose


   Dian.
Mine Honors such a Ring,


My chastities the Iewell of our house,


Bequeathed downe from many Ancestors,


Which were the greatest obloquie i'th world,


In mee to loose.
Thus your owne proper wisedome


Brings in the Champion honor on my part,


Against your vaine assault


   Ber.
Heere, take my Ring,


My house, mine honor, yea my life be thine,


And Ile be bid by thee


   Dia.
When midnight comes, knocke at my chamber


window:


Ile order take, my mother shall not heare.
Now will I charge you in the band of truth,


When you haue conquer'd my yet maiden-bed,


Remaine there but an houre, nor speake to mee:


My reasons are most strong, and you shall know them,


When backe againe this Ring shall be deliuer'd:


And on your finger in the night, Ile put


Another Ring, that what in time proceeds,


May token to the future, our past deeds.
Adieu till then, then faile not: you haue wonne


A wife of me, though there my hope be done


   Ber.
A heauen on earth I haue won by wooing thee
   Di.
For which, liue long to thank both heauen & me,


You may so in the end.
My mother told me iust how he would woo,


As if she sate in's heart.
She sayes, all men


Haue the like oathes: He had sworne to marrie me


When his wife's dead: therfore Ile lye with him


When I am buried.
Since Frenchmen are so braide,


Marry that will, I liue and die a Maid:


Onely in this disguise, I think't no sinne,


To cosen him that would vniustly winne.
Exit
Enter the two French Captaines, and some two or three Souldiours.
Cap.G.
You haue not giuen him his mothers letter
   Cap.E.
I haue deliu'red it an houre since, there is som
thing in't that stings his nature: for on the reading it,
he chang'd almost into another man
   Cap.G.
He has much worthy blame laid vpon him,
for shaking off so good a wife, and so sweet a Lady
   Cap.E.
Especially, hee hath incurred the euerlasting
displeasure of the King, who had euen tun'd his bounty
to sing happinesse to him.
I will tell you a thing, but
you shall let it dwell darkly with you
   Cap.G.
When you haue spoken it 'tis dead, and I am
the graue of it
   Cap.E.
Hee hath peruerted a young Gentlewoman
heere in Florence, of a most chaste renown, & this night
he fleshes his will in the spoyle of her honour: hee hath
giuen her his monumentall Ring, and thinkes himselfe
made in the vnchaste composition
   Cap.G.
Now God delay our rebellion as we are our
selues, what things are we
   Cap.E.
Meerely our owne traitours.
And as in the
common course of all treasons, we still see them reueale
themselues, till they attaine to their abhorr'd ends: so
he that in this action contriues against his owne Nobility
in his proper streame, ore-flowes himselfe
   Cap.G.
Is it not meant damnable in vs, to be Trumpeters
of our vnlawfull intents?
We shall not then haue
his company to night?
Cap.E.
Not till after midnight: for hee is dieted to
his houre
   Cap.G.
That approaches apace: I would gladly haue
him see his company anathomiz'd, that hee might take
a measure of his owne iudgements, wherein so curiously
he had set this counterfeit
   Cap.E.
We will not meddle with him till he come;


for his presence must be the whip of the other


   Cap.G.
In the meane time, what heare you of these


Warres?
Cap.E.
I heare there is an ouerture of peace


   Cap.G.
Nay, I assure you a peace concluded
   Cap.E.
What will Count Rossillion do then?
Will he


trauaile higher, or returne againe into France?
Cap.G.
I perceiue by this demand, you are not altogether


of his councell


   Cap.E.
Let it be forbid sir, so should I bee a great


deale of his act


   Cap.G.
Sir, his wife some two months since fledde
from his house, her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Iaques
le grand; which holy vndertaking, with most austere
sanctimonie she accomplisht: and there residing,
the tendernesse of her Nature, became as a prey to her
greefe: in fine, made a groane of her last breath, & now
she sings in heauen
   Cap.E.
How is this iustified?
Cap.G.
The stronger part of it by her owne Letters,
which makes her storie true, euen to the poynt of her
death: her death it selfe, which could not be her office
to say, is come: was faithfully confirm'd by the Rector
of the place
   Cap.E.
Hath the Count all this intelligence?
Cap.G.
I, and the particular confirmations, point


from point, to the full arming of the veritie


   Cap.E.
I am heartily sorrie that hee'l bee gladde of


this


   Cap.G.
How mightily sometimes, we make vs comforts


of our losses


   Cap.E.
And how mightily some other times, wee
drowne our gaine in teares, the great dignitie that his
valour hath here acquir'd for him, shall at home be encountred
with a shame as ample
   Cap.G.
The webbe of our life, is of a mingled yarne,
good and ill together: our vertues would bee proud, if
our faults whipt them not, and our crimes would dispaire
if they were not cherish'd by our vertues.
Enter a Messenger.
How now?
Where's your master?
Ser.
He met the Duke in the street sir, of whom hee
hath taken a solemne leaue: his Lordshippe will next
morning for France.
The Duke hath offered him Letters
of commendations to the King
   Cap.E.
They shall bee no more then needfull there,
if they were more then they can commend.
Enter Count Rossillion.
Ber.
They cannot be too sweete for the Kings tartnesse,
heere's his Lordship now.
How now my Lord,
i'st not after midnight?
Ber.
I haue to night dispatch'd sixteene businesses, a
moneths length a peece, by an abstract of successe: I
haue congied with the Duke, done my adieu with his
neerest; buried a wife, mourn'd for her, writ to my Ladie
mother, I am returning, entertain'd my Conuoy, &
betweene these maine parcels of dispatch, affected many
nicer needs: the last was the greatest, but that I haue
not ended yet
   Cap.E.
If the businesse bee of any difficulty, and this
morning your departure hence, it requires hast of your
Lordship
   Ber.
I meane the businesse is not ended, as fearing
to heare of it hereafter: but shall we haue this dialogue
betweene the Foole and the Soldiour.
Come, bring
forth this counterfet module, ha's deceiu'd mee, like a
double-meaning Prophesier
   Cap.E.
Bring him forth, ha's sate i'th stockes all night
poore gallant knaue
   Ber.
No matter, his heeles haue deseru'd it, in vsurping
his spurres so long.
How does he carry himselfe?
Cap.E.
I haue told your Lordship alreadie: The
stockes carrie him.
But to answer you as you would be
vnderstood, hee weepes like a wench that had shed her
milke, he hath confest himselfe to Morgan, whom hee
supposes to be a Friar, fro[m] the time of his remembrance
to this very instant disaster of his setting i'th stockes:
and what thinke you he hath confest?
Ber.
Nothing of me, ha's a?
Cap.E.
His confession is taken, and it shall bee read
to his face, if your Lordshippe be in't, as I beleeue you
are, you must haue the patience to heare it.
Enter Parolles with his Interpreter.
Ber.
A plague vpon him, muffeld; he can say nothing
of me: hush, hush
   Cap.G.
Hoodman comes: Portotartarossa
   Inter.
He calles for the tortures, what will you say


without em


   Par.
I will confesse what I know without constraint,


If ye pinch me like a Pasty, I can say no more


   Int.
Bosko Chimurcho
   Cap.
Boblibindo chicurmurco
   Int.
You are a mercifull Generall: Our Generall
bids you answer to what I shall aske you out of a Note
   Par.
And truly, as I hope to liue
   Int.
First demand of him, how many horse the Duke
is strong.
What say you to that?
Par.
Fiue or sixe thousand, but very weake and vnseruiceable:
the troopes are all scattered, and the Commanders
verie poore rogues, vpon my reputation and
credit, and as I hope to liue
   Int.
Shall I set downe your answer so?
Par.
Do, Ile take the Sacrament on't, how & which


way you will: all's one to him


   Ber.
What a past-sauing slaue is this?
Cap.G.
Y'are deceiu'd my Lord, this is Mounsieur
Parrolles the gallant militarist, that was his owne phrase
that had the whole theoricke of warre in the knot of his
scarfe, and the practise in the chape of his dagger
   Cap.E.
I will neuer trust a man againe, for keeping
his sword cleane, nor beleeue he can haue euerie thing
in him, by wearing his apparrell neatly
   Int.
Well, that's set downe
   Par.
Fiue or six thousand horse I sed, I will say true,
or thereabouts set downe, for Ile speake truth
   Cap.G.
He's very neere the truth in this
   Ber.
But I con him no thankes for't in the nature he
deliuers it
   Par.
Poore rogues, I pray you say
   Int.
Well, that's set downe
   Par.
I humbly thanke you sir, a truth's a truth, the


Rogues are maruailous poore


   Interp.
Demaund of him of what strength they are a
foot.
What say you to that?
Par.
By my troth sir, if I were to liue this present
houre, I will tell true.
Let me see, Spurio a hundred &
fiftie, Sebastian so many, Corambus so many, Iaques so
many: Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowicke, and Gratij, two hundred
fiftie each: Mine owne Company, Chitopher, Vaumond,
Bentij, two hundred fiftie each: so that the muster
file, rotten and sound, vppon my life amounts not to fifteene
thousand pole, halfe of the which, dare not shake
the snow from off their Cassockes, least they shake themselues
to peeces
   Ber.
What shall be done to him?
Cap.G.
Nothing, but let him haue thankes.
Demand


of him my condition: and what credite I haue with the


Duke


   Int.
Well that's set downe: you shall demaund of
him, whether one Captaine Dumaine bee i'th Campe, a
Frenchman: what his reputation is with the Duke, what
his valour, honestie, and expertnesse in warres: or whether
he thinkes it were not possible with well-waighing
summes of gold to corrupt him to a reuolt.
What say you
to this?
What do you know of it?
Par.
I beseech you let me answer to the particular of
the intergatories.
Demand them singly
   Int.
Do you know this Captaine Dumaine?
Par.
I know him, a was a Botchers Prentize in Paris,
from whence he was whipt for getting the Shrieues fool
with childe, a dumbe innocent that could not say him
nay
   Ber.
Nay, by your leaue hold your hands, though I


know his braines are forfeite to the next tile that fals


   Int.
Well, is this Captaine in the Duke of Florences


campe?
Par.
Vpon my knowledge he is, and lowsie


   Cap.G.
Nay looke not so vpon me: we shall heare of


your Lord anon


   Int.
What is his reputation with the Duke?
Par.
The Duke knowes him for no other, but a poore


Officer of mine, and writ to mee this other day, to turne


him out a'th band.
I thinke I haue his Letter in my pocket


   Int.
Marry we'll search
   Par.
In good sadnesse I do not know, either it is there,
or it is vpon a file with the Dukes other Letters, in my
Tent
   Int.
Heere 'tis, heere's a paper, shall I reade it to you?
Par.
I do not know if it be it or no


   Ber.
Our Interpreter do's it well
   Cap.G.
Excellently
   Int.
Dian, the Counts a foole, and full of gold
   Par.
That is not the Dukes letter sir: that is an aduertisement
to a proper maide in Florence, one Diana, to
take heede of the allurement of one Count Rossillion, a
foolish idle boy: but for all that very ruttish.
I pray you
sir put it vp againe
   Int.
Nay, Ile reade it first by your fauour
   Par.
My meaning in't I protest was very honest in the
behalfe of the maid: for I knew the young Count to be a
dangerous and lasciuious boy, who is a whale to Virginity,
and deuours vp all the fry it finds
   Ber.
Damnable both-sides rogue
   Int.
Let.
When he sweares oathes, bid him drop gold, and


take it:


After he scores, he neuer payes the score:


Halfe won is match well made, match and well make it,


He nere payes after-debts, take it before,


And say a souldier (Dian) told thee this:


Men are to mell with, boyes are not to kis.
For count of this, the Counts a Foole I know it,


Who payes before, but not when he does owe it.
Thine as he vow'd to thee in thine eare,


Parolles


   Ber.
He shall be whipt through the Armie with this


rime in's forehead


   Cap.E.
This is your deuoted friend sir, the manifold


Linguist, and the army-potent souldier


   Ber.
I could endure any thing before but a Cat, and


now he's a Cat to me


   Int.
I perceiue sir by your Generals lookes, wee shall


be faine to hang you


   Par.
My life sir in any case: Not that I am afraide to
dye, but that my offences beeing many, I would repent
out the remainder of Nature.
Let me liue sir in a dungeon,
i'th stockes, or any where, so I may liue
   Int.
Wee'le see what may bee done, so you confesse
freely: therefore once more to this Captaine Dumaine:
you haue answer'd to his reputation with the Duke, and
to his valour.
What is his honestie?
Par.
He will steale sir an Egge out of a Cloister: for
rapes and rauishments he paralels Nessus.
Hee professes
not keeping of oaths, in breaking em he is stronger then
Hercules.
He will lye sir, with such volubilitie, that you
would thinke truth were a foole: drunkennesse is his best
vertue, for he will be swine-drunke, and in his sleepe he
does little harme, saue to his bed-cloathes about him:
but they know his conditions, and lay him in straw.
I
haue but little more to say sir of his honesty, he ha's euerie
thing that an honest man should not haue; what an
honest man should haue, he has nothing
   Cap.G.
I begin to loue him for this
   Ber.
For this description of thine honestie?
A pox
vpon him for me, he's more and more a Cat
   Int.
What say you to his expertnesse in warre?
Par.
Faith sir, ha's led the drumme before the English
Tragedians: to belye him I will not, and more of his
souldiership I know not, except in that Country, he had
the honour to be the Officer at a place there called Mile-end,
to instruct for the doubling of files.
I would doe the
man what honour I can, but of this I am not certaine
   Cap.G.
He hath out-villain'd villanie so farre, that the
raritie redeemes him
   Ber.
A pox on him, he's a Cat still
   Int.
His qualities being at this poore price, I neede
not to aske you, if Gold will corrupt him to reuolt
   Par.
Sir, for a Cardceue he will sell the fee-simple of
his saluation, the inheritance of it, and cut th' intaile from
all remainders, and a perpetuall succession for it perpetually
   Int.
What's his Brother, the other Captain Dumain?
Cap.E.
Why do's he aske him of me?
Int.
What's he?
Par.
E'ne a Crow a'th same nest: not altogether so
great as the first in goodnesse, but greater a great deale in
euill.
He excels his Brother for a coward, yet his Brother
is reputed one of the best that is.
In a retreate hee outrunnes
any Lackey; marrie in comming on, hee ha's the
Crampe
   Int.
If your life be saued, will you vndertake to betray
the Florentine
   Par.
I, and the Captaine of his horse, Count Rossillion
   Int.
Ile whisper with the Generall, and knowe his
pleasure
   Par.
Ile no more drumming, a plague of all drummes,
onely to seeme to deserue well, and to beguile the supposition
of that lasciuious yong boy the Count, haue I run
into this danger: yet who would haue suspected an ambush
where I was taken?
Int.
There is no remedy sir, but you must dye: the
Generall sayes, you that haue so traitorously discouerd
the secrets of your army, and made such pestifferous reports
of men very nobly held, can serue the world for
no honest vse: therefore you must dye.
Come headesman,
off with his head
   Par.
O Lord sir let me liue, or let me see my death
   Int.
That shall you, and take your leaue of all your


friends:


So, looke about you, know you any heere?
Count.
Good morrow noble Captaine


   Lo.E.
God blesse you Captaine Parolles
   Cap.G.
God saue you noble Captaine
   Lo.E.
Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord


Lafew?
I am for France


   Cap.G.
Good Captaine will you giue me a Copy of
the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalfe of the Count
Rossillion, and I were not a verie Coward, I'de compell
it of you, but far you well.
Exeunt.
Int.
You are vndone Captaine all but your scarfe,
that has a knot on't yet
   Par.
Who cannot be crush'd with a plot?
Inter.
If you could finde out a Countrie where but
women were that had receiued so much shame, you
might begin an impudent Nation.
Fare yee well sir, I
am for France too, we shall speake of you there.
Exit
  Par.
Yet am I thankfull: if my heart were great


'Twould burst at this: Captaine Ile be no more,


But I will eate, and drinke, and sleepe as soft


As Captaine shall.
Simply the thing I am


Shall make me liue: who knowes himselfe a braggart


Let him feare this; for it will come to passe,


That euery braggart shall be found an Asse.
Rust sword, coole blushes, and Parrolles liue


Safest in shame: being fool'd, by fool'rie thriue;


There's place and meanes for euery man aliue.
Ile after them.
Enter.
Enter Hellen, Widdow, and Diana.
Hel.
That you may well perceiue I haue not


wrong'd you,


One of the greatest in the Christian world


Shall be my suretie: for whose throne 'tis needfull


Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneele.
Time was, I did him a desired office


Deere almost as his life, which gratitude


Through flintie Tartars bosome would peepe forth,


And answer thankes.
I duly am inform'd,


His grace is at Marcellae, to which place


We haue conuenient conuoy: you must know


I am supposed dead, the Army breaking,


My husband hies him home, where heauen ayding,


And by the leaue of my good Lord the King,


Wee'l be before our welcome


   Wid.
Gentle Madam,


You neuer had a seruant to whose trust


Your busines was more welcome


   Hel.
Nor your Mistris


Euer a friend, whose thoughts more truly labour


To recompence your loue: Doubt not but heauen


Hath brought me vp to be your daughters dower,


As it hath fated her to be my motiue


And helper to a husband.
But O strange men,


That can such sweet vse make of what they hate,


When sawcie trusting of the cosin'd thoughts


Defiles the pitchy night, so lust doth play


With what it loathes, for that which is away,


But more of this heereafter: you Diana,


Vnder my poore instructions yet must suffer


Something in my behalfe


   Dia.
Let death and honestie


Go with your impositions, I am yours


Vpon your will to suffer


   Hel.
Yet I pray you:


But with the word the time will bring on summer,


When Briars shall haue leaues as well as thornes,


And be as sweet as sharpe: we must away,


Our Wagon is prepar'd, and time reuiues vs,


All's well that ends well, still the fines the Crowne;


What ere the course, the end is the renowne.
Exeunt.
Enter Clowne, old Lady, and Lafew.
Laf.
No, no, no, your sonne was misled with a snipt
taffata fellow there, whose villanous saffron wold haue
made all the vnbak'd and dowy youth of a nation in his
colour: your daughter-in-law had beene aliue at this
houre, and your sonne heere at home, more aduanc'd
by the King, then by that red-tail'd humble Bee I speak
of
   La.
I would I had not knowne him, it was the death
of the most vertuous gentlewoman, that euer Nature
had praise for creating.
If she had pertaken of my flesh
and cost mee the deerest groanes of a mother, I could
not haue owed her a more rooted loue
   Laf.
Twas a good Lady, 'twas a good Lady.
Wee
may picke a thousand sallets ere wee light on such another
hearbe
   Clo.
Indeed sir she was the sweete Margerom of the
sallet, or rather the hearbe of grace
   Laf.
They are not hearbes you knaue, they are nose-hearbes
   Clowne.
I am no great Nabuchadnezar sir, I haue not


much skill in grace


   Laf.
Whether doest thou professe thy selfe, a knaue


or a foole?
Clo.
A foole sir at a womans seruice, and a knaue at a


mans


   Laf.
Your distinction
   Clo.
I would cousen the man of his wife, and do his
seruice
   Laf.
So you were a knaue at his seruice indeed
   Clo.
And I would giue his wife my bauble sir to doe


her seruice


   Laf.
I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knaue


and foole


   Clo.
At your seruice
   Laf.
No, no, no
   Clo.
Why sir, if I cannot serue you, I can serue as


great a prince as you are


   Laf.
Whose that, a Frenchman?
Clo.
Faith sir a has an English maine, but his fisnomie


is more hotter in France then there


   Laf.
What prince is that?
Clo.
The blacke prince sir, alias the prince of darkenesse,


alias the diuell


   Laf.
Hold thee there's my purse, I giue thee not this
to suggest thee from thy master thou talk'st off, serue
him still
   Clo.
I am a woodland fellow sir, that alwaies loued
a great fire, and the master I speak of euer keeps a good
fire, but sure he is the Prince of the world, let his Nobilitie
remaine in's Court.
I am for the house with the
narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pompe to
enter: some that humble themselues may, but the manie
will be too chill and tender, and theyle bee for the
flowrie way that leads to the broad gate, and the great
fire
   Laf.
Go thy waies, I begin to bee a wearie of thee,
and I tell thee so before, because I would not fall out
with thee.
Go thy wayes, let my horses be wel look'd
too, without any trickes
   Clo.
If I put any trickes vpon em sir, they shall bee


Iades trickes, which are their owne right by the law of


Nature.
Exit
  Laf.
A shrewd knaue and an vnhappie
   Lady.
So a is.
My Lord that's gone made himselfe
much sport out of him, by his authoritie hee remaines
heere, which he thinkes is a pattent for his sawcinesse,
and indeede he has no pace, but runnes where he will
   Laf.
I like him well, 'tis not amisse: and I was about
to tell you, since I heard of the good Ladies death, and
that my Lord your sonne was vpon his returne home.
I
moued the King my master to speake in the behalfe of
my daughter, which in the minoritie of them both, his
Maiestie out of a selfe gracious remembrance did first
propose, his Highnesse hath promis'd me to doe it, and
to stoppe vp the displeasure he hath conceiued against
your sonne, there is no fitter matter.
How do's your
Ladyship like it?
La.
With verie much content my Lord, and I wish
it happily effected
   Laf.
His Highnesse comes post from Marcellus, of as
able bodie as when he number'd thirty, a will be heere
to morrow, or I am deceiu'd by him that in such intelligence
hath seldome fail'd
   La.
It reioyces me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
die.
I haue letters that my sonne will be heere to night:
I shall beseech your Lordship to remaine with mee, till
they meete together
   Laf.
Madam, I was thinking with what manners I
might safely be admitted
   Lad.
You neede but pleade your honourable priuiledge
   Laf.
Ladie, of that I haue made a bold charter, but


I thanke my God, it holds yet.
Enter Clowne.
Clo.
O Madam, yonders my Lord your sonne with
a patch of veluet on's face, whether there bee a scar vnder't
or no, the Veluet knowes, but 'tis a goodly patch
of Veluet, his left cheeke is a cheeke of two pile and a
halfe, but his right cheeke is worne bare
   Laf.
A scarre nobly got,


Or a noble scarre, is a good liu'rie of honor,


So belike is that


   Clo.
But it is your carbinado'd face
   Laf.
Let vs go see
your sonne I pray you, I long to talke
With the yong noble souldier
   Clowne.
'Faith there's a dozen of em, with delicate
fine hats, and most courteous feathers, which bow the
head, and nod at euerie man.
Exeunt.
Actus Quintus.
Enter Hellen, Widdow, and Diana, with two Attendants.
Hel.
But this exceeding posting day and night,


Must wear your spirits low, we cannot helpe it:


But since you haue made the daies and nights as one,


To weare your gentle limbes in my affayres,


Be bold you do so grow in my requitall,


As nothing can vnroote you.
In happie time,


Enter a gentle Astringer.
This man may helpe me to his Maiesties eare,


If he would spend his power.
God saue you sir

And you

Sir, I haue seene you in the Court of France
   Gent.
I haue beene sometimes there
   Hel.
I do presume sir, that you are not falne


From the report that goes vpon your goodnesse,


And therefore goaded with most sharpe occasions,


Which lay nice manners by, I put you to


The vse of your owne vertues, for the which


I shall continue thankefull


   Gent.
What's your will?

That it will please you


To giue this poore petition to the King,


And ayde me with that store of power you haue


To come into his presence

The Kings not heere

Not heere sir?
Gen. Not indeed,


He hence remou'd last night, and with more hast


Then is his vse


   Wid.
Lord how we loose our paines
   Hel.
All's well that ends well yet,


Though time seeme so aduerse, and meanes vnfit:


I do beseech you, whither is he gone?
Gent.
Marrie as I take it to Rossillion,


Whither I am going


   Hel.
I do beseech you sir,


Since you are like to see the King before me,


Commend the paper to his gracious hand,


Which I presume shall render you no blame,


But rather make you thanke your paines for it,


I will come after you with what good speede


Our meanes will make vs meanes


   Gent.
This Ile do for you
   Hel.
And you shall finde your selfe to be well thankt


what e're falles more.
We must to horse againe, Go, go,

Par.
Good Mr Lauatch giue my Lord Lafew this letter,
I haue ere now sir beene better knowne to you, when
I haue held familiaritie with fresher cloathes: but I am
now sir muddied in fortunes mood, and smell somewhat
strong of her strong displeasure
   Clo.
Truely, Fortunes displeasure is but sluttish if it
smell so strongly as thou speak'st of: I will hencefoorth
eate no Fish of Fortunes butt'ring.
Prethee alow the
winde
   Par.
Nay you neede not to stop your nose sir: I spake
but by a Metaphor
   Clo.
Indeed sir, if your Metaphor stinke, I will stop
my nose, or against any mans Metaphor.
Prethe get thee
further
   Par.
Pray you sir deliuer me this paper
   Clo.
Foh, prethee stand away: a paper from fortunes


close-stoole, to giue to a Nobleman.
Looke heere he


comes himselfe.
Enter Lafew.
Clo.
Heere is a purre of Fortunes sir, or of Fortunes
Cat, but not a Muscat, that ha's falne into the vncleane
fish-pond of her displeasure, and as he sayes is muddied
withall.
Pray you sir, vse the Carpe as you may, for he
lookes like a poore decayed, ingenious, foolish, rascally
knaue.
I doe pittie his distresse in my smiles of comfort,
and leaue him to your Lordship
   Par.
My Lord I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly
scratch'd
   Laf.
And what would you haue me to doe?
'Tis too
late to paire her nailes now.
Wherein haue you played
the knaue with fortune that she should scratch you, who
of her selfe is a good Lady, and would not haue knaues
thriue long vnder?
There's a Cardecue for you: Let the
Iustices make you and fortune friends; I am for other
businesse
   Par.
I beseech your honour to heare mee one single


word,


  Laf.
you begge a single peny more: Come you shall


ha't, saue your word


   Par.
My name my good Lord is Parrolles
   Laf.
You begge more then word then.
Cox my passion,


giue me your hand: How does your drumme?
Par.
O my good Lord, you were the first that found


mee


   Laf.
Was I insooth?
And I was the first that lost thee
   Par.
It lies in you my Lord to bring me in some grace
for you did bring me out
   Laf.
Out vpon thee knaue, doest thou put vpon mee
at once both the office of God and the diuel: one brings
thee in grace, and the other brings thee out.
The Kings
comming I know by his Trumpets.
Sirrah, inquire further
after me, I had talke of you last night, though you
are a foole and a knaue, you shall eate, go too, follow
   Par.
I praise God for you.
Flourish.
Enter King, old Lady, Lafew, the two French Lords, with
attendants.
Kin.
We lost a Iewell of her, and our esteeme


Was made much poorer by it: but your sonne,


As mad in folly, lack'd the sence to know


Her estimation home


   Old La.
'Tis past my Liege,


And I beseech your Maiestie to make it


Naturall rebellion, done i'th blade of youth,


When oyle and fire, too strong for reasons force,


Ore-beares it, and burnes on


   Kin.
My honour'd Lady,


I haue forgiuen and forgotten all,


Though my reuenges were high bent vpon him,


And watch'd the time to shoote


   Laf.
This I must say,


But first I begge my pardon: the yong Lord


Did to his Maiesty, his Mother, and his Ladie,


Offence of mighty note; but to himselfe


The greatest wrong of all.
He lost a wife,


Whose beauty did astonish the suruey


Of richest eies: whose words all eares tooke captiue,


Whose deere perfection, hearts that scorn'd to serue,


Humbly call'd Mistris


   Kin.
Praising what is lost,


Makes the remembrance deere.
Well, call him hither,


We are reconcil'd, and the first view shall kill


All repetition: Let him not aske our pardon,


The nature of his great offence is dead,


And deeper then obliuion, we do burie


Th' incensing reliques of it.
Let him approach


A stranger, no offender; and informe him


So 'tis our will he should


   Gent.
I shall my Liege
   Kin.
What sayes he to your daughter,


Haue you spoke?
Laf.
All that he is, hath reference to your Highnes


   Kin.
Then shall we haue a match.
I haue letters sent
me, that sets him high in fame.
Enter Count Bertram.
Laf.
He lookes well on't
   Kin.
I am not a day of season,


For thou maist see a sun-shine, and a haile


In me at once: But to the brightest beames


Distracted clouds giue way, so stand thou forth,


The time is faire againe


   Ber.
My high repented blames


Deere Soueraigne pardon to me


   Kin.
All is whole,


Not one word more of the consumed time,


Let's take the instant by the forward top:


For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees


Th' inaudible, and noiselesse foot of time


Steales, ere we can effect them.
You remember


The daughter of this Lord?
Ber.
Admiringly my Liege, at first


I stucke my choice vpon her, ere my heart


Durst make too bold a herauld of my tongue:


Where the impression of mine eye enfixing,


Contempt his scornfull Perspectiue did lend me,


Which warpt the line, of euerie other fauour,


Scorn'd a faire colour, or exprest it stolne,


Extended or contracted all proportions


To a most hideous obiect.
Thence it came,


That she whom all men prais'd, and whom my selfe,


Since I haue lost, haue lou'd; was in mine eye


The dust that did offend it


   Kin.
Well excus'd:


That thou didst loue her, strikes some scores away


From the great compt: but loue that comes too late,


Like a remorsefull pardon slowly carried


To the great sender, turnes a sowre offence,


Crying, that's good that's gone: Our rash faults,


Make triuiall price of serious things we haue,


Not knowing them, vntill we know their graue.
Oft our displeasures to our selues vniust,


Destroy our friends, and after weepe their dust:


Our owne loue waking, cries to see what's done,


While shamefull hate sleepes out the afternoone.
Be this sweet Helens knell, and now forget her.
Send forth your amorous token for faire Maudlin,


The maine consents are had, and heere wee'l stay


To see our widdowers second marriage day:


Which better then the first, O deere heauen blesse,


Or, ere they meete in me, O Nature cesse


   Laf.
Come on my sonne, in whom my houses name


Must be digested: giue a fauour from you


To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,


That she may quickly come.
By my old beard,


And eu'rie haire that's on't, Helen that's dead


Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,


The last that ere I tooke her leaue at Court,


I saw vpon her finger


   Ber.
Hers it was not
   King.
Now pray you let me see it.
For mine eye,


While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd too't:


This Ring was mine, and when I gaue it Hellen,


I bad her if her fortunes euer stoode


Necessitied to helpe, that by this token


I would releeue her.
Had you that craft to reaue her


Of what should stead her most?
Ber.
My gracious Soueraigne,


How ere it pleases you to take it so,


The ring was neuer hers


   Old La.
Sonne, on my life


I haue seene her weare it, and she reckon'd it


At her liues rate


   Laf.
I am sure I saw her weare it
   Ber.
You are deceiu'd my Lord, she neuer saw it:


In Florence was it from a casement throwne mee,


Wrap'd in a paper, which contain'd the name


Of her that threw it: Noble she was, and thought


I stood ingag'd, but when I had subscrib'd


To mine owne fortune, and inform'd her fully,


I could not answer in that course of Honour


As she had made the ouerture, she ceast


In heauie satisfaction, and would neuer


Receiue the Ring againe


   Kin.
Platus himselfe,


That knowes the tinct and multiplying med'cine,


Hath not in natures mysterie more science,


Then I haue in this Ring.
'Twas mine, 'twas Helens,


Who euer gaue it you: then if you know


That you are well acquainted with your selfe,


Confesse 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement


You got it from her.
She call'd the Saints to suretie,


That she would neuer put it from her finger,


Vnlesse she gaue it to your selfe in bed,


Where you haue neuer come: or sent it vs


Vpon her great disaster


   Ber.
She neuer saw it
   Kin.
Thou speak'st it falsely: as I loue mine Honor,


And mak'st connecturall feares to come into me,


Which I would faine shut out, if it should proue


That thou art so inhumane, 'twill not proue so:


And yet I know not, thou didst hate her deadly,


And she is dead, which nothing but to close


Her eyes my selfe, could win me to beleeue,


More then to see this Ring.
Take him away,


My fore-past proofes, how ere the matter fall


Shall taze my feares of little vanitie,


Hauing vainly fear'd too little.
Away with him,


Wee'l sift this matter further


   Ber.
If you shall proue


This Ring was euer hers, you shall as easie


Proue that I husbanded her bed in Florence,


Where yet she neuer was.
Enter a Gentleman.
King.
I am wrap'd in dismall thinkings
   Gen. Gracious Soueraigne.
Whether I haue beene too blame or no, I know not,


Here's a petition from a Florentine,


Who hath for foure or fiue remoues come short,


To tender it her selfe.
I vndertooke it,


Vanquish'd thereto by the faire grace and speech


Of the poore suppliant, who by this I know


Is heere attending: her businesse lookes in her


With an importing visage, and she told me


In a sweet verball breefe, it did concerne


Your Highnesse with her selfe.
A Letter.
Vpon his many protestations to marrie mee when his wife was
dead, I blush to say it, he wonne me.
Now is the Count Rossillion
a Widdower, his vowes are forfeited to mee, and my
honors payed to him.
Hee stole from Florence, taking no
leaue, and I follow him to his Countrey for Iustice: Grant
it me, O King, in you it best lies, otherwise a seducer flourishes,
and a poore Maid is vndone.
Diana Capilet
   Laf.
I will buy me a sonne in Law in a faire, and toule


for this.
Ile none of him


   Kin.
The heauens haue thought well on thee Lafew,


To bring forth this discou'rie, seeke these sutors:


Go speedily, and bring againe the Count.
Enter Bertram.
I am a-feard the life of Hellen (Ladie)


Was fowly snatcht


   Old La.
Now iustice on the doers
   King.
I wonder sir, sir, wiues are monsters to you,


And that you flye them as you sweare them Lordship,


Yet you desire to marry.
What woman's that?
Enter Widdow, Diana, and Parrolles.
Dia.
I am my Lord a wretched Florentine,


Deriued from the ancient Capilet,


My suite as I do vnderstand you know,


And therefore know how farre I may be pittied


   Wid.
I am her Mother sir, whose age and honour


Both suffer vnder this complaint we bring,


And both shall cease, without your remedie


   King.
Come hether Count, do you know these Women?
Ber.
My Lord, I neither can nor will denie,


But that I know them, do they charge me further?
Dia.
Why do you looke so strange vpon your wife?
Ber.
She's none of mine my Lord


   Dia.
If you shall marrie


You giue away this hand, and that is mine,


You giue away heauens vowes, and those are mine:


You giue away my selfe, which is knowne mine:


For I by vow am so embodied yours,


That she which marries you, must marrie me,


Either both or none


   Laf.
Your reputation comes too short for my daughter,


you are no husband for her


   Ber.
My Lord, this is a fond and desp'rate creature,


Whom sometime I haue laugh'd with: Let your highnes


Lay a more noble thought vpon mine honour,


Then for to thinke that I would sinke it heere


   Kin.
Sir for my thoughts, you haue them il to friend,


Till your deeds gaine them fairer: proue your honor,


Then in my thought it lies


   Dian.
Good my Lord,


Aske him vpon his oath, if hee do's thinke


He had not my virginity


   Kin.
What saist thou to her?
Ber.
She's impudent my Lord,


And was a common gamester to the Campe


   Dia.
He do's me wrong my Lord: If I were so,


He might haue bought me at a common price.
Do not beleeue him.
O behold this Ring,


Whose high respect and rich validitie


Did lacke a Paralell: yet for all that


He gaue it to a Commoner a'th Campe


If I be one


   Coun.
He blushes, and 'tis hit:


Of sixe preceding Ancestors that Iemme


Confer'd by testament to'th sequent issue


Hath it beene owed and worne.
This is his wife,


That Ring's a thousand proofes


   King.
Me thought you saide


You saw one heere in Court could witnesse it


   Dia.
I did my Lord, but loath am to produce


So bad an instrument, his names Parrolles


   Laf.
I saw the man to day, if man he bee
   Kin.
Finde him, and bring him hether
   Ros.
What of him:


He's quoted for a most perfidious slaue


With all the spots a'th world, taxt and debosh'd,


Whose nature sickens: but to speake a truth,


Am I, or that or this for what he'l vtter,


That will speake any thing


   Kin.
She hath that Ring of yours
   Ros.
I thinke she has; certaine it is I lyk'd her,


And boorded her i'th wanton way of youth:


She knew her distance, and did angle for mee,


Madding my eagernesse with her restraint,


As all impediments in fancies course


Are motiues of more fancie, and in fine,


Her insuite comming with her moderne grace,


Subdu'd me to her rate, she got the Ring,


And I had that which any inferiour might


At Market price haue bought


   Dia.
I must be patient:


You that haue turn'd off a first so noble wife,


May iustly dyet me.
I pray you yet,


(Since you lacke vertue, I will loose a husband)


Send for your Ring, I will returne it home,


And giue me mine againe


   Ros.
I haue it not
   Kin.
What Ring was yours I pray you?
Dian.
Sir much like the same vpon your finger


   Kin.
Know you this Ring, this Ring was his of late
   Dia.
And this was it I gaue him being a bed
   Kin.
The story then goes false, you threw it him


Out of a Casement


   Dia.
I haue spoke the truth.
Enter Parolles.
Ros.
My Lord, I do confesse the ring was hers
   Kin.
You boggle shrewdly, euery feather starts you:


Is this the man you speake of?
Dia.
I, my Lord


   Kin.
Tell me sirrah, but tell me true I charge you,
Not fearing the displeasure of your master:
Which on your iust proceeding, Ile keepe off,
By him and by this woman heere, what know you?
Par.
So please your Maiesty, my master hath bin an
honourable Gentleman.
Trickes hee hath had in him,
which Gentlemen haue
   Kin.
Come, come, to'th' purpose: Did hee loue this


woman?
Par.
Faith sir he did loue her, but how


   Kin.
How I pray you?
Par.
He did loue her sir, as a Gent.
loues a Woman


   Kin.
How is that?
Par.
He lou'd her sir, and lou'd her not


   Kin.
As thou art a knaue and no knaue, what an equiuocall


Companion is this?
Par.
I am a poore man, and at your Maiesties command


   Laf.
Hee's a good drumme my Lord, but a naughtie


Orator


   Dian.
Do you know he promist me marriage?
Par.
Faith I know more then Ile speake


   Kin.
But wilt thou not speake all thou know'st?
Par.
Yes so please your Maiesty: I did goe betweene
them as I said, but more then that he loued her, for indeede
he was madde for her, and talkt of Sathan, and of
Limbo, and of Furies, and I know not what: yet I was in
that credit with them at that time, that I knewe of their
going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her
marriage, and things which would deriue mee ill will to
speake of, therefore I will not speake what I know
   Kin.
Thou hast spoken all alreadie, vnlesse thou canst
say they are maried, but thou art too fine in thy euidence,
therefore stand aside.
This Ring you say was yours
   Dia.
I my good Lord
   Kin.
Where did you buy it?
Or who gaue it you?
Dia.
It was not giuen me, nor I did not buy it


   Kin.
Who lent it you?
Dia.
It was not lent me neither


   Kin.
Where did you finde it then?
Dia.
I found it not


   Kin.
If it were yours by none of all these wayes,


How could you giue it him?
Dia.
I neuer gaue it him


   Laf.
This womans an easie gloue my Lord, she goes


off and on at pleasure


   Kin.
This Ring was mine, I gaue it his first wife
   Dia.
It might be yours or hers for ought I know
   Kin.
Take her away, I do not like her now,


To prison with her: and away with him,


Vnlesse thou telst me where thou hadst this Ring,


Thou diest within this houre


   Dia.
Ile neuer tell you
   Kin.
Take her away
   Dia.
Ile put in baile my liedge
   Kin.
I thinke thee now some common Customer
   Dia.
By Ioue if euer I knew man 'twas you
   King.
Wherefore hast thou accusde him al this while
   Dia.
Because he's guiltie, and he is not guilty:


He knowes I am no Maid, and hee'l sweare too't:


Ile sweare I am a Maid, and he knowes not.
Great King I am no strumpet, by my life,


I am either Maid, or else this old mans wife


   Kin.
She does abuse our eares, to prison with her
   Dia.
Good mother fetch my bayle.
Stay Royall sir,


The Ieweller that owes the Ring is sent for,


And he shall surety me.
But for this Lord,


Who hath abus'd me as he knowes himselfe,


Though yet he neuer harm'd me, heere I quit him.
He knowes himselfe my bed he hath defil'd,


And at that time he got his wife with childe:


Dead though she be, she feeles her yong one kicke:


So there's my riddle, one that's dead is quicke,


And now behold the meaning.
Enter Hellen and Widdow.
Kin.
Is there no exorcist


Beguiles the truer Office of mine eyes?
Is't reall that I see?
Hel.
No my good Lord,


'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,


The name, and not the thing


   Ros.
Both, both, O pardon
   Hel.
Oh my good Lord, when I was like this Maid,


I found you wondrous kinde, there is your Ring,


And looke you, heeres your letter: this it sayes,


When from my finger you can get this Ring,


And is by me with childe, &c. This is done,


Will you be mine now you are doubly wonne?
Ros.
If she my Liege can make me know this clearly,


Ile loue her dearely, euer, euer dearly


   Hel.
If it appeare not plaine, and proue vntrue,


Deadly diuorce step betweene me and you.
O my deere mother do I see you liuing?
Laf.
Mine eyes smell Onions, I shall weepe anon:


Good Tom Drumme lend me a handkercher.

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.
The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.
This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.
If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.
[10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]

Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
  ORLANDO.
As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion


bequeathed


    me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,


    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and


there


    begins my sadness.
My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and


    report speaks goldenly of his profit.
For my part, he keeps


me


    rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here


at


    home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my


    birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox?
His horses


are


    bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their


feeding,


    they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly


    hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth;


for


    the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to


him


    as I.
Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me,


the


    something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take


from


    me.
He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a


    brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with


my


    education.
This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit


of


    my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny


against


    this servitude.
I will no longer endure it, though yet I know


no


    wise remedy how to avoid it.
Enter OLIVER
  ADAM.
Yonder comes my master, your brother.
ORLANDO.
Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake


me


    up.
[ADAM retires]


  OLIVER.
Now, sir!
what make you here?
ORLANDO.
Nothing; I am not taught to make any thing.
OLIVER.
What mar you then, sir?
ORLANDO.
Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God


made, a


    poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
OLIVER.
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.
ORLANDO.
Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them?
What


    prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such


penury?
OLIVER.
Know you where you are, sir?
ORLANDO.
O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
OLIVER.
Know you before whom, sir?
ORLANDO.
Ay, better than him I am before knows me.
I know you


are


    my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you


    should so know me.
The courtesy of nations allows you my


better


    in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes


not


    away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us.
I have


as


    much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming


    before me is nearer to his reverence.
OLIVER.
What, boy!
[Strikes him]


  ORLANDO.
Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
OLIVER.
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
ORLANDO.
I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland


de


    Boys.
He was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says


such


    a father begot villains.
Wert thou not my brother, I would


not


    take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out


thy


    tongue for saying so.
Thou has rail'd on thyself.
ADAM.
[Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for your


father's


    remembrance, be at accord.
OLIVER.
Let me go, I say.
ORLANDO.
I will not, till I please; you shall hear me.
My


father


    charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have


    train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all


    gentleman-like qualities.
The spirit of my father grows


strong in


    me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such


    exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor


    allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go


buy


    my fortunes.
OLIVER.
And what wilt thou do?
Beg, when that is spent?
Well,


sir,


    get you in.
I will not long be troubled with you; you shall


have


    some part of your will.
I pray you leave me.
ORLANDO.
I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
OLIVER.
Get you with him, you old dog.
ADAM.
Is 'old dog' my reward?
Most true, I have lost my teeth


in


    your service.
God be with my old master!
He would not have


spoke


    such a word.
Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM


  OLIVER.
Is it even so?
Begin you to grow upon me?
I will physic


    your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither.
Holla,


    Dennis!
Enter DENNIS
  DENNIS.
Calls your worship?
OLIVER.
Was not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to speak


with


me?
DENNIS.
So please you, he is here at the door and importunes


access


    to you.
OLIVER.
Call him in.
[Exit DENNIS] 'Twill be a good way; and


    to-morrow the wrestling is.
Enter CHARLES
  CHARLES.
Good morrow to your worship.
OLIVER.
Good Monsieur Charles!
What's the new news at the new
    court?
CHARLES.
There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news;
that
    is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new
Duke;
    and three or four loving lords have put themselves into
voluntary
    exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke;
    therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
OLIVER.
Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke's daughter, be
banished
    with her father?
CHARLES.
O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
her,
    being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would
have
    followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her.
She is
at
    the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own
    daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.
OLIVER.
Where will the old Duke live?
CHARLES.
They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a
many
    merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin
Hood
    of England.
They say many young gentlemen flock to him every
day,
    and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden
world.
OLIVER.
What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new Duke?
CHARLES.
Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
    matter.
I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your
younger
    brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd
against
    me to try a fall.
To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit;
and he
    that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
well.
Your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, I
would
    be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he
come
    in; therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to
acquaint
    you withal, that either you might stay him from his
intendment,
    or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it
is
    thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
OLIVER.
Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou
shalt
    find I will most kindly requite.
I had myself notice of my
    brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means
laboured to
    dissuade him from it; but he is resolute.
I'll tell thee,
    Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full
of
    ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a
secret
    and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.
Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break
his
    neck as his finger.
And thou wert best look to't; for if thou
    dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace
    himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison,
entrap
    thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he
    hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I
    assure thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not
one
    so young and so villainous this day living.
I speak but
brotherly
    of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
blush
    and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.
CHARLES.
I am heartily glad I came hither to you.
If he come
    to-morrow I'll give him his payment.
If ever he go alone
again,
    I'll never wrestle for prize more.
And so, God keep your
worship!
Exit
  OLIVER.
Farewell, good Charles.
Now will I stir this gamester.
I
    hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not
why,
    hates nothing more than he.
Yet he's gentle; never school'd
and
    yet learned; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly
    beloved; and, indeed, so much in the heart of the world, and
    especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am
    altogether misprised.
But it shall not be so long; this
wrestler
    shall clear all.
Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy
    thither, which now I'll go about.
Exit

Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
  CELIA.
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
ROSALIND.
Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;


and


    would you yet I were merrier?
Unless you could teach me to


forget


    a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any


    extraordinary pleasure.
CELIA.
Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight


that I


    love thee.
If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy


    uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me,


I


    could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so


wouldst


    thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously


temper'd


    as mine is to thee.
ROSALIND.
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to


    rejoice in yours.
CELIA.
You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like


to


    have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for


what


    he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render


thee


    again in affection.
By mine honour, I will; and when I break


that


    oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear


    Rose, be merry.
ROSALIND.
From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
Let me see; what think you of falling in love?
CELIA.
Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no


man


    in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with


safety


    of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.
ROSALIND.
What shall be our sport, then?
CELIA.
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her


    wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
ROSALIND.
I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily


    misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in


her


    gifts to women.
CELIA.
'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce


makes


    honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very


    ill-favouredly.
ROSALIND.
Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to


Nature's:


    Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments


of


    Nature.
Enter TOUCHSTONE
  CELIA.
No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not


by


    Fortune fall into the fire?
Though Nature hath given us wit


to


    flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut


off


    the argument?
ROSALIND.
Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when


    Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's


wit.
CELIA.
Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but


    Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason


of


    such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone;


for


    always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.
How


    now, wit!
Whither wander you?
TOUCHSTONE.
Mistress, you must come away to your father.
CELIA.
Were you made the messenger?
TOUCHSTONE.
No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.
ROSALIND.
Where learned you that oath, fool?
TOUCHSTONE.
Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they


were


    good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was


naught.
Now I'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the


mustard


    was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
CELIA.
How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?
ROSALIND.
Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
TOUCHSTONE.
Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and


swear


    by your beards that I am a knave.
CELIA.
By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
TOUCHSTONE.
By my knavery, if I had it, then I were.
But if you


    swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn; no more was


this


    knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if


he


    had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes


or


    that mustard.
CELIA.
Prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?
TOUCHSTONE.
One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
CELIA.
My father's love is enough to honour him.
Enough, speak


no


    more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.
TOUCHSTONE.
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what


wise


    men do foolishly.
CELIA.
By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit


that


    fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men


have


    makes a great show.
Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.
Enter LE BEAU
  ROSALIND.
With his mouth full of news.
CELIA.
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
ROSALIND.
Then shall we be news-cramm'd.
CELIA.
All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
Bon


jour,


    Monsieur Le Beau.
What's the news?
LE BEAU.
Fair Princess, you have lost much good sport.
CELIA.
Sport!
of what colour?
LE BEAU.
What colour, madam?
How shall I answer you?
ROSALIND.
As wit and fortune will.
TOUCHSTONE.
Or as the Destinies decrees.
CELIA.
Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.
TOUCHSTONE.
Nay, if I keep not my rank-


  ROSALIND.
Thou losest thy old smell.
LE BEAU.
You amaze me, ladies.
I would have told you of good


    wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
ROSALIND.
Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
LE BEAU.
I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your


    ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do;


and


    here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.
CELIA.
Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
LE BEAU.
There comes an old man and his three sons-


  CELIA.
I could match this beginning with an old tale.
LE BEAU.
Three proper young men, of excellent growth and


presence.
ROSALIND.
With bills on their necks: 'Be it known unto all men


by


    these presents'-


  LE BEAU.
The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the


Duke's


    wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke


three of


    his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him.
So he


serv'd


    the second, and so the third.
Yonder they lie; the poor old


man,


    their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the


    beholders take his part with weeping.
ROSALIND.
Alas!
TOUCHSTONE.
But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies


have


    lost?
LE BEAU.
Why, this that I speak of.
TOUCHSTONE.
Thus men may grow wiser every day.
It is the first


time


    that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.
CELIA.
Or I, I promise thee.
ROSALIND.
But is there any else longs to see this broken music


in


    his sides?
Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking?
Shall we


    see this wrestling, cousin?
LE BEAU.
You must, if you stay here; for here is the place


    appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform


it.
CELIA.
Yonder, sure, they are coming.
Let us now stay and see


it.
Flourish.
Enter DUKE FREDERICK, LORDS, ORLANDO,


                     CHARLES, and ATTENDANTS


  FREDERICK.
Come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his


own


    peril on his forwardness.
ROSALIND.
Is yonder the man?
LE BEAU.
Even he, madam.
CELIA.
Alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.
FREDERICK.
How now, daughter and cousin!
Are you crept hither


to


    see the wrestling?
ROSALIND.
Ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.
FREDERICK.
You will take little delight in it, I can tell you,


    there is such odds in the man.
In pity of the challenger's


youth


    I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated.
Speak to


    him, ladies; see if you can move him.
CELIA.
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
FREDERICK.
Do so; I'll not be by.
[DUKE FREDERICK goes apart]


  LE BEAU.
Monsieur the Challenger, the Princess calls for you.
ORLANDO.
I attend them with all respect and duty.
ROSALIND.
Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?
ORLANDO.
No, fair Princess; he is the general challenger.
I


come


    but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my


youth.
CELIA.
Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your


years.
You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength; if you saw


    yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment,


the


    fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal


    enterprise.
We pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your


own


    safety and give over this attempt.
ROSALIND.
Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be


    misprised: we will make it our suit to the Duke that the


    wrestling might not go forward.
ORLANDO.
I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,


    wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and


excellent


    ladies any thing.
But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go


    with me to my trial; wherein if I be foil'd there is but one


    sham'd that was never gracious; if kill'd, but one dead that


is


    willing to be so.
I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have


none


    to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing;


only


    in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied


when


    I have made it empty.
ROSALIND.
The little strength that I have, I would it were with


    you.
CELIA.
And mine to eke out hers.
ROSALIND.
Fare you well.
Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you!
CELIA.
Your heart's desires be with you!
CHARLES.
Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous


to


    lie with his mother earth?
ORLANDO.
Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest


working.
FREDERICK.
You shall try but one fall.
CHARLES.
No, I warrant your Grace, you shall not entreat him to


a


    second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.
ORLANDO.
You mean to mock me after; you should not have mock'd


me


    before; but come your ways.
ROSALIND.
Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!
CELIA.
I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by


the


    leg.
[They wrestle]


  ROSALIND.
O excellent young man!
CELIA.
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who


should


    down.
[CHARLES is thrown.
Shout]


  FREDERICK.
No more, no more.
ORLANDO.
Yes, I beseech your Grace; I am not yet well breath'd.
FREDERICK.
How dost thou, Charles?
LE BEAU.
He cannot speak, my lord.
FREDERICK.
Bear him away.
What is thy name, young man?
ORLANDO.
Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de


    Boys.
FREDERICK.
I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
The world esteem'd thy father honourable,


    But I did find him still mine enemy.
Thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed,


    Hadst thou descended from another house.
But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth;


    I would thou hadst told me of another father.
Exeunt DUKE, train, and LE BEAU


  CELIA.
Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
ORLANDO.
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,


    His youngest son- and would not change that calling


    To be adopted heir to Frederick.
ROSALIND.
My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul,


    And all the world was of my father's mind;


    Had I before known this young man his son,


    I should have given him tears unto entreaties


    Ere he should thus have ventur'd.
CELIA.
Gentle cousin,


    Let us go thank him, and encourage him;


    My father's rough and envious disposition


    Sticks me at heart.
Sir, you have well deserv'd;


    If you do keep your promises in love


    But justly as you have exceeded all promise,


    Your mistress shall be happy.
ROSALIND.
Gentleman,        [Giving him a chain from her neck]


    Wear this for me; one out of suits with fortune,


    That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
Shall we go, coz?
CELIA.
Ay.
Fare you well, fair gentleman.
ORLANDO.
Can I not say 'I thank you'?
My better parts


    Are all thrown down; and that which here stands up


    Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
ROSALIND.
He calls us back.
My pride fell with my fortunes;


    I'll ask him what he would.
Did you call, sir?
Sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown


    More than your enemies.
CELIA.
Will you go, coz?
ROSALIND.
Have with you.
Fare you well.
Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA


  ORLANDO.
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
I cannot speak to her, yet she urg'd conference.
O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
Re-enter LE BEAU
  LE BEAU.
Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you


    To leave this place.
Albeit you have deserv'd


    High commendation, true applause, and love,


    Yet such is now the Duke's condition


    That he misconstrues all that you have done.
The Duke is humorous; what he is, indeed,


    More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
ORLANDO.
I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:


    Which of the two was daughter of the Duke


    That here was at the wrestling?
LE BEAU.
Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;


    But yet, indeed, the smaller is his daughter;


    The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke,


    And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,


    To keep his daughter company; whose loves


    Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
But I can tell you that of late this Duke


    Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,


    Grounded upon no other argument


    But that the people praise her for her virtues


    And pity her for her good father's sake;


    And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady


    Will suddenly break forth.
Sir, fare you well.
Hereafter, in a better world than this,


    I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
ORLANDO.
I rest much bounden to you; fare you well.
Exit LE BEAU


    Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;


    From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother.
But heavenly Rosalind!
Exit


Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
  CELIA.
Why, cousin!
why, Rosalind!
Cupid have mercy!
Not a word?
ROSALIND.
Not one to throw at a dog.
CELIA.
No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon


curs;


    throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
ROSALIND.
Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one


should


    be lam'd with reasons and the other mad without any.
CELIA.
But is all this for your father?
ROSALIND.
No, some of it is for my child's father.
O, how full


of


    briers is this working-day world!
CELIA.
They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday


    foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very


petticoats


    will catch them.
ROSALIND.
I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my


    heart.
CELIA.
Hem them away.
ROSALIND.
I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
CELIA.
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
ROSALIND.
O, they take the part of a better wrestler than


myself.
CELIA.
O, a good wish upon you!
You will try in time, in


despite of


    a fall.
But, turning these jests out of service, let us talk


in


    good earnest.
Is it possible, on such a sudden, you should


fall


    into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
ROSALIND.
The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly.
CELIA.
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son


dearly?
By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated


his


    father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.
ROSALIND.
No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
CELIA.
Why should I not?
Doth he not deserve well?
Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS
  ROSALIND.
Let me love him for that; and do you love him because


I


    do.
Look, here comes the Duke.
CELIA.
With his eyes full of anger.
FREDERICK.
Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,


    And get you from our court.
ROSALIND.
Me, uncle?
FREDERICK.
You, cousin.
Within these ten days if that thou beest found


    So near our public court as twenty miles,


    Thou diest for it.
ROSALIND.
I do beseech your Grace,


    Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
If with myself I hold intelligence,


    Or have acquaintance with mine own desires;


    If that I do not dream, or be not frantic-


    As I do trust I am not- then, dear uncle,


    Never so much as in a thought unborn


    Did I offend your Highness.
FREDERICK.
Thus do all traitors;


    If their purgation did consist in words,


    They are as innocent as grace itself.
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
ROSALIND.
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
FREDERICK.
Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
ROSALIND.
So was I when your Highness took his dukedom;


    So was I when your Highness banish'd him.
Treason is not inherited, my lord;


    Or, if we did derive it from our friends,


    What's that to me?
My father was no traitor.
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much


    To think my poverty is treacherous.
CELIA.
Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
FREDERICK.
Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,


    Else had she with her father rang'd along.
CELIA.
I did not then entreat to have her stay;


    It was your pleasure, and your own remorse;


    I was too young that time to value her,


    But now I know her.
If she be a traitor,


    Why so am I: we still have slept together,


    Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together;


    And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,


    Still we went coupled and inseparable.
FREDERICK.
She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,


    Her very silence and her patience,


    Speak to the people, and they pity her.
Thou art a fool.
She robs thee of thy name;


    And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous


    When she is gone.
Then open not thy lips.
Firm and irrevocable is my doom


    Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
CELIA.
Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;


    I cannot live out of her company.
FREDERICK.
You are a fool.
You, niece, provide yourself.
If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,


    And in the greatness of my word, you die.
Exeunt DUKE and LORDS


  CELIA.
O my poor Rosalind!
Whither wilt thou go?
Wilt thou change fathers?
I will give thee mine.
I charge thee be not thou more griev'd than I am.
ROSALIND.
I have more cause.
CELIA.
Thou hast not, cousin.
Prithee be cheerful.
Know'st thou not the Duke


    Hath banish'd me, his daughter?
ROSALIND.
That he hath not.
CELIA.
No, hath not?
Rosalind lacks, then, the love


    Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.
Shall we be sund'red?
Shall we part, sweet girl?
No; let my father seek another heir.
Therefore devise with me how we may fly,


    Whither to go, and what to bear with us;


    And do not seek to take your charge upon you,


    To bear your griefs yourself, and leave me out;


    For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,


    Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
ROSALIND.
Why, whither shall we go?
CELIA.
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
ROSALIND.
Alas, what danger will it be to us,


    Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
CELIA.
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,


    And with a kind of umber smirch my face;


    The like do you; so shall we pass along,


    And never stir assailants.
ROSALIND.
Were it not better,


    Because that I am more than common tall,


    That I did suit me all points like a man?
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,


    A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart


    Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will-


    We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,


    As many other mannish cowards have


    That do outface it with their semblances.
CELIA.
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
ROSALIND.
I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,


    And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
But what will you be call'd?
CELIA.
Something that hath a reference to my state:


    No longer Celia, but Aliena.
ROSALIND.
But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal


    The clownish fool out of your father's court?
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
CELIA.
He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;


    Leave me alone to woo him.
Let's away,


    And get our jewels and our wealth together;


    Devise the fittest time and safest way


    To hide us from pursuit that will be made


    After my flight.
Now go we in content


    To liberty, and not to banishment.
Exeunt

Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three LORDS, like foresters
  DUKE SENIOR.
Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,


    Hath not old custom made this life more sweet


    Than that of painted pomp?
Are not these woods


    More free from peril than the envious court?
Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,


    The seasons' difference; as the icy fang


    And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,


    Which when it bites and blows upon my body,


    Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say


    'This is no flattery; these are counsellors


    That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
Sweet are the uses of adversity,


    Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,


    Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;


    And this our life, exempt from public haunt,


    Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,


    Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
I would not change it.
AMIENS.
Happy is your Grace,


    That can translate the stubbornness of fortune


    Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
DUKE SENIOR.
Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,


    Being native burghers of this desert city,


    Should, in their own confines, with forked heads


    Have their round haunches gor'd.
FIRST LORD.
Indeed, my lord,


    The melancholy Jaques grieves at that;


    And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp


    Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself


    Did steal behind him as he lay along


    Under an oak whose antique root peeps out


    Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
To the which place a poor sequest'red stag,


    That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,


    Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord,


    The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans


    That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat


    Almost to bursting; and the big round tears


    Cours'd one another down his innocent nose


    In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,


    Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,


    Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,


    Augmenting it with tears.
DUKE SENIOR.
But what said Jaques?
Did he not moralize this spectacle?
FIRST LORD.
O, yes, into a thousand similes.
First, for his weeping into the needless stream:


    'Poor deer,' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament


    As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more


    To that which had too much.'
Then, being there alone,


    Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:


    ''Tis right'; quoth he 'thus misery doth part


    The flux of company.'
Anon, a careless herd,


    Full of the pasture, jumps along by him


    And never stays to greet him.
'Ay,' quoth Jaques


    'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;


    'Tis just the fashion.
Wherefore do you look


    Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
Thus most invectively he pierceth through


    The body of the country, city, court,


    Yea, and of this our life; swearing that we


    Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,


    To fright the animals, and to kill them up


    In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
DUKE SENIOR.
And did you leave him in this contemplation?
SECOND LORD.
We did, my lord, weeping and commenting


    Upon the sobbing deer.
DUKE SENIOR.
Show me the place;


    I love to cope him in these sullen fits,


    For then he's full of matter.
FIRST LORD.
I'll bring you to him straight.
Exeunt


Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS
  FREDERICK.
Can it be possible that no man saw them?
It cannot be; some villains of my court


    Are of consent and sufferance in this.
FIRST LORD.
I cannot hear of any that did see her.
The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,


    Saw her abed, and in the morning early


    They found the bed untreasur'd of their mistress.
SECOND LORD.
My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft


    Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
Hisperia, the Princess' gentlewoman,


    Confesses that she secretly o'erheard


    Your daughter and her cousin much commend


    The parts and graces of the wrestler


    That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;


    And she believes, wherever they are gone,


    That youth is surely in their company.
FREDERICK.
Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither.
If he be absent, bring his brother to me;


    I'll make him find him.
Do this suddenly;


    And let not search and inquisition quail


    To bring again these foolish runaways.
Exeunt


Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting
  ORLANDO.
Who's there?
ADAM.
What, my young master?
O my gentle master!
O my sweet master!
O you memory


    Of old Sir Rowland!
Why, what make you here?
Why are you virtuous?
Why do people love you?
And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
Why would you be so fond to overcome


    The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke?
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
Know you not, master, to some kind of men


    Their graces serve them but as enemies?
No more do yours.
Your virtues, gentle master,


    Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
O, what a world is this, when what is comely


    Envenoms him that bears it!
ORLANDO.
Why, what's the matter?
ADAM.
O unhappy youth!
Come not within these doors; within this roof


    The enemy of all your graces lives.
Your brother- no, no brother; yet the son-


    Yet not the son; I will not call him son


    Of him I was about to call his father-


    Hath heard your praises; and this night he means


    To burn the lodging where you use to lie,


    And you within it.
If he fail of that,


    He will have other means to cut you off;


    I overheard him and his practices.
This is no place; this house is but a butchery;


    Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
ORLANDO.
Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
ADAM.
No matter whither, so you come not here.
ORLANDO.
What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,


    Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce


    A thievish living on the common road?
This I must do, or know not what to do;


    Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
I rather will subject me to the malice


    Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
ADAM.
But do not so.
I have five hundred crowns,


    The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father,


    Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,


    When service should in my old limbs lie lame,


    And unregarded age in corners thrown.
Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,


    Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,


    Be comfort to my age!
Here is the gold;


    All this I give you.
Let me be your servant;


    Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;


    For in my youth I never did apply


    Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,


    Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo


    The means of weakness and debility;


    Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,


    Frosty, but kindly.
Let me go with you;


    I'll do the service of a younger man


    In all your business and necessities.
ORLANDO.
O good old man, how well in thee appears


    The constant service of the antique world,


    When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
Thou art not for the fashion of these times,


    Where none will sweat but for promotion,


    And having that do choke their service up


    Even with the having; it is not so with thee.
But, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree


    That cannot so much as a blossom yield


    In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.
But come thy ways, we'll go along together,


    And ere we have thy youthful wages spent


    We'll light upon some settled low content.
ADAM.
Master, go on; and I will follow thee


    To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
From seventeen years till now almost four-score


    Here lived I, but now live here no more.
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,


    But at fourscore it is too late a week;


    Yet fortune cannot recompense me better


    Than to die well and not my master's debtor.
Exeunt


Enter ROSALIND for GANYMEDE, CELIA for ALIENA, and CLOWN alias


TOUCHSTONE


  ROSALIND.
O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
TOUCHSTONE.
I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not


weary.
ROSALIND.
I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's


apparel,


    and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort the weaker


vessel, as


    doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to


petticoat;


    therefore, courage, good Aliena.
CELIA.
I pray you bear with me; I cannot go no further.
TOUCHSTONE.
For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear


you;


    yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you; for I think you


    have no money in your purse.
ROSALIND.
Well, this is the Forest of Arden.
TOUCHSTONE.
Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was


at


    home I was in a better place; but travellers must be content.
Enter CORIN and SILVIUS
  ROSALIND.
Ay, be so, good Touchstone.
Look you, who comes here,


a


    young man and an old in solemn talk.
CORIN.
That is the way to make her scorn you still.
SILVIUS.
O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
CORIN.
I partly guess; for I have lov'd ere now.
SILVIUS.
No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,


    Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover


    As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow.
But if thy love were ever like to mine,


    As sure I think did never man love so,


    How many actions most ridiculous


    Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
CORIN.
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
SILVIUS.
O, thou didst then never love so heartily!
If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly


    That ever love did make thee run into,


    Thou hast not lov'd;


    Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,


    Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,


    Thou hast not lov'd;


    Or if thou hast not broke from company


    Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,


    Thou hast not lov'd.
O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!
Exit Silvius


  ROSALIND.
Alas, poor shepherd!
searching of thy wound,


    I have by hard adventure found mine own.
TOUCHSTONE.
And I mine.
I remember, when I was in love, I broke


my


    sword upon a stone, and bid him take that for coming a-night


to


    Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing of her batler, and the


    cow's dugs that her pretty chapt hands had milk'd; and I


remember


    the wooing of peascod instead of her; from whom I took two


cods,


    and giving her them again, said with weeping tears 'Wear


these


    for my sake.'
We that are true lovers run into strange


capers;


    but as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love


mortal


    in folly.
ROSALIND.
Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of.
TOUCHSTONE.
Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I


break


    my shins against it.
ROSALIND.
Jove, Jove!
this shepherd's passion


    Is much upon my fashion.
TOUCHSTONE.
And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
CELIA.
I pray you, one of you question yond man


    If he for gold will give us any food;


    I faint almost to death.
TOUCHSTONE.
Holla, you clown!
ROSALIND.
Peace, fool; he's not thy kinsman.
CORIN.
Who calls?
TOUCHSTONE.
Your betters, sir.
CORIN.
Else are they very wretched.
ROSALIND.
Peace, I say.
Good even to you, friend.
CORIN.
And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
ROSALIND.
I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold


    Can in this desert place buy entertainment,


    Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.
Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd,


    And faints for succour.
CORIN.
Fair sir, I pity her,


    And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,


    My fortunes were more able to relieve her;


    But I am shepherd to another man,


    And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
My master is of churlish disposition,


    And little recks to find the way to heaven


    By doing deeds of hospitality.
Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed,


    Are now on sale; and at our sheepcote now,


    By reason of his absence, there is nothing


    That you will feed on; but what is, come see,


    And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
ROSALIND.
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
CORIN.
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,


    That little cares for buying any thing.
ROSALIND.
I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,


    Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,


    And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
CELIA.
And we will mend thy wages.
I like this place,


    And willingly could waste my time in it.
CORIN.
Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
Go with me; if you like upon report


    The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,


    I will your very faithful feeder be,


    And buy it with your gold right suddenly.
Exeunt


Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and OTHERS
                       SONG


  AMIENS.
Under the greenwood tree


               Who loves to lie with me,


               And turn his merry note


               Unto the sweet bird's throat,


             Come hither, come hither, come hither.
Here shall he see


               No enemy


             But winter and rough weather.
JAQUES.
More, more, I prithee, more.
AMIENS.
It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
JAQUES.
I thank it.
More, I prithee, more.
I can suck


melancholy


    out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.
More, I prithee, more.
AMIENS.
My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you.
JAQUES.
I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to


sing.
Come, more; another stanzo.
Call you 'em stanzos?
AMIENS.
What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
JAQUES.
Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me nothing.
Will


    you sing?
AMIENS.
More at your request than to please myself.
JAQUES.
Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but


    that they call compliment is like th' encounter of two


dog-apes;


    and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a


    penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks.
Come, sing; and


you


    that will not, hold your tongues.
AMIENS.
Well, I'll end the song.
Sirs, cover the while; the


Duke


    will drink under this tree.
He hath been all this day to look


    you.
JAQUES.
And I have been all this day to avoid him.
He is too


    disputable for my company.
I think of as many matters as he;


but


    I give heaven thanks, and make no boast of them.
Come,


warble, come.
SONG


              [All together here]


           Who doth ambition shun,


           And loves to live i' th' sun,


           Seeking the food he eats,


           And pleas'd with what he gets,


         Come hither, come hither, come hither.
Here shall he see


           No enemy


           But winter and rough weather.
JAQUES.
I'll give you a verse to this note that I made


yesterday in


    despite of my invention.
AMIENS.
And I'll sing it.
JAQUES.
Thus it goes:


             If it do come to pass


             That any man turn ass,


             Leaving his wealth and ease


             A stubborn will to please,


           Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame;


             Here shall he see


             Gross fools as he,


             An if he will come to me.
AMIENS.
What's that 'ducdame'?
JAQUES.
'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle.
I'll


    go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll rail against all the


    first-born of Egypt.
AMIENS.
And I'll go seek the Duke; his banquet is prepar'd.
Exeunt severally


Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
  ADAM.
Dear master, I can go no further.
O, I die for food!
Here


lie


    I down, and measure out my grave.
Farewell, kind master.
ORLANDO.
Why, how now, Adam!
No greater heart in thee?
Live a


    little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.
If this


uncouth


    forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or


    bring it for food to thee.
Thy conceit is nearer death than


thy


    powers.
For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at the


    arm's end.
I will here be with thee presently; and if I bring


thee


    not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die; but if


thou


    diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labour.
Well


said!
thou look'st cheerly; and I'll be with thee quickly.
Yet thou


    liest in the bleak air.
Come, I will bear thee to some


shelter;


    and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner, if there live


    anything in this desert.
Cheerly, good Adam!
Exeunt


A table set out.
Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like
outlaws
  DUKE SENIOR.
I think he be transform'd into a beast;


    For I can nowhere find him like a man.
FIRST LORD.
My lord, he is but even now gone hence;


    Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
DUKE SENIOR.
If he, compact of jars, grow musical,


    We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
Go seek him; tell him I would speak with him.
Enter JAQUES
  FIRST LORD.
He saves my labour by his own approach.
DUKE SENIOR.
Why, how now, monsieur!
what a life is this,


    That your poor friends must woo your company?
What, you look merrily!
JAQUES.
A fool, a fool!
I met a fool i' th' forest,


    A motley fool.
A miserable world!
As I do live by food, I met a fool,


    Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,


    And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,


    In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.
'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he,


    'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.'
And then he drew a dial from his poke,


    And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,


    Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;


    Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags;


    'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;


    And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;


    And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,


    And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;


    And thereby hangs a tale.'
When I did hear


    The motley fool thus moral on the time,


    My lungs began to crow like chanticleer


    That fools should be so deep contemplative;


    And I did laugh sans intermission


    An hour by his dial.
O noble fool!
A worthy fool!
Motley's the only wear.
DUKE SENIOR.
What fool is this?
JAQUES.
O worthy fool!
One that hath been a courtier,


    And says, if ladies be but young and fair,


    They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,


    Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit


    After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd


    With observation, the which he vents


    In mangled forms.
O that I were a fool!
I am ambitious for a motley coat.
DUKE SENIOR.
Thou shalt have one.
JAQUES.
It is my only suit,


    Provided that you weed your better judgments


    Of all opinion that grows rank in them


    That I am wise.
I must have liberty


    Withal, as large a charter as the wind,


    To blow on whom I please, for so fools have;


    And they that are most galled with my folly,


    They most must laugh.
And why, sir, must they so?
The why is plain as way to parish church:


    He that a fool doth very wisely hit


    Doth very foolishly, although he smart,


    Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,


    The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd


    Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool.
Invest me in my motley; give me leave


    To speak my mind, and I will through and through


    Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world,


    If they will patiently receive my medicine.
DUKE SENIOR.
Fie on thee!
I can tell what thou wouldst do.
JAQUES.
What, for a counter, would I do but good?
DUKE SENIOR.
Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;


    For thou thyself hast been a libertine,


    As sensual as the brutish sting itself;


    And all th' embossed sores and headed evils


    That thou with license of free foot hast caught


    Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
JAQUES.
Why, who cries out on pride


    That can therein tax any private party?
Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,


    Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?
What woman in the city do I name


    When that I say the city-woman bears


    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
Who can come in and say that I mean her,


    When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
Or what is he of basest function


    That says his bravery is not on my cost,


    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits


    His folly to the mettle of my speech?
There then!
how then?
what then?
Let me see wherein


    My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,


    Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,


    Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,


    Unclaim'd of any man.
But who comes here?
Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn
  ORLANDO.
Forbear, and eat no more.
JAQUES.
Why, I have eat none yet.
ORLANDO.
Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.
JAQUES.
Of what kind should this cock come of?
DUKE SENIOR.
Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?
Or else a rude despiser of good manners,


    That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
ORLANDO.
You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point


    Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show


    Of smooth civility; yet am I inland bred,


    And know some nurture.
But forbear, I say;


    He dies that touches any of this fruit


    Till I and my affairs are answered.
JAQUES.
An you will not be answer'd with reason, I must die.
DUKE SENIOR.
What would you have?
Your gentleness shall force


    More than your force move us to gentleness.
ORLANDO.
I almost die for food, and let me have it.
DUKE SENIOR.
Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
ORLANDO.
Speak you so gently?
Pardon me, I pray you;


    I thought that all things had been savage here,


    And therefore put I on the countenance


    Of stern commandment.
But whate'er you are


    That in this desert inaccessible,


    Under the shade of melancholy boughs,


    Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;


    If ever you have look'd on better days,


    If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,


    If ever sat at any good man's feast,


    If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,


    And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,


    Let gentleness my strong enforcement be;


    In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
DUKE SENIOR.
True is it that we have seen better days,


    And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,


    And sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes


    Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red;


    And therefore sit you down in gentleness,


    And take upon command what help we have


    That to your wanting may be minist'red.
ORLANDO.
Then but forbear your food a little while,


    Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,


    And give it food.
There is an old poor man


    Who after me hath many a weary step


    Limp'd in pure love; till he be first suffic'd,


    Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,


    I will not touch a bit.
DUKE SENIOR.
Go find him out.
And we will nothing waste till you return.
ORLANDO.
I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
Exit


  DUKE SENIOR.
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:


    This wide and universal theatre


    Presents more woeful pageants than the scene


    Wherein we play in.
JAQUES.
All the world's a stage,


    And all the men and women merely players;


    They have their exits and their entrances;


    And one man in his time plays many parts,


    His acts being seven ages.
At first the infant,


    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;


    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel


    And shining morning face, creeping like snail


    Unwillingly to school.
And then the lover,


    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad


    Made to his mistress' eyebrow.
Then a soldier,


    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,


    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,


    Seeking the bubble reputation


    Even in the cannon's mouth.
And then the justice,


    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,


    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,


    Full of wise saws and modern instances;


    And so he plays his part.
The sixth age shifts


    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,


    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,


    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide


    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,


    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes


    And whistles in his sound.
Last scene of all,


    That ends this strange eventful history,


    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;


    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.
Re-enter ORLANDO with ADAM
  DUKE SENIOR.
Welcome.
Set down your venerable burden,


    And let him feed.
ORLANDO.
I thank you most for him.
ADAM.
So had you need;


    I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
DUKE SENIOR.
Welcome; fall to.
I will not trouble you


    As yet to question you about your fortunes.
Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
SONG


            Blow, blow, thou winter wind,


            Thou art not so unkind


              As man's ingratitude;


            Thy tooth is not so keen,


            Because thou art not seen,


              Although thy breath be rude.
Heigh-ho!
sing heigh-ho!
unto the green holly.
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.
Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
This life is most jolly.
Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,


            That dost not bite so nigh


              As benefits forgot;


            Though thou the waters warp,


            Thy sting is not so sharp


              As friend rememb'red not.
Heigh-ho!
sing, &c.


  DUKE SENIOR.
If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,


    As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,


    And as mine eye doth his effigies witness


    Most truly limn'd and living in your face,


    Be truly welcome hither.
I am the Duke


    That lov'd your father.
The residue of your fortune,


    Go to my cave and tell me.
Good old man,


    Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
Support him by the arm.
Give me your hand,


    And let me all your fortunes understand.
Exeunt


Enter DUKE FREDERICK, OLIVER, and LORDS
  FREDERICK.
Not see him since!
Sir, sir, that cannot be.
But were I not the better part made mercy,


    I should not seek an absent argument


    Of my revenge, thou present.
But look to it:


    Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is;


    Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living


    Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more


    To seek a living in our territory.
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine


    Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,


    Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth


    Of what we think against thee.
OLIVER.
O that your Highness knew my heart in this!
I never lov'd my brother in my life.
FREDERICK.
More villain thou.
Well, push him out of doors;


    And let my officers of such a nature


    Make an extent upon his house and lands.
Do this expediently, and turn him going.
Exeunt


Enter ORLANDO, with a paper
  ORLANDO.
Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love;


    And thou, thrice-crowned Queen of Night, survey


    With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,


    Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
O Rosalind!
these trees shall be my books,


    And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,


    That every eye which in this forest looks


    Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree,


    The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.
Exit


                     Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
  CORIN.
And how like you this shepherd's life, Master
Touchstone?
TOUCHSTONE.
Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
    life; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it is
nought.
In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in
    respect that it is private, it is a very vile life.
Now in
    respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in
respect
    it is not in the court, it is tedious.
As it is a spare life,
    look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more
plenty
    in it, it goes much against my stomach.
Hast any philosophy
in
    thee, shepherd?
CORIN.
No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse
at
    ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content,
is
    without three good friends; that the property of rain is to
wet,
    and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that
a
    great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that
hath
    learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good
breeding,
    or comes of a very dull kindred.
TOUCHSTONE.
Such a one is a natural philosopher.
Wast ever in
    court, shepherd?
CORIN.
No, truly.
TOUCHSTONE.
Then thou art damn'd.
CORIN.
Nay, I hope.
TOUCHSTONE.
Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg,
all on
    one side.
CORIN.
For not being at court?
Your reason.
TOUCHSTONE.
Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st
good
    manners; if thou never saw'st good manners, then thy manners
must
    be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation.
Thou
art
    in a parlous state, shepherd.
CORIN.
Not a whit, Touchstone.
Those that are good manners at
the
    court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of
the
    country is most mockable at the court.
You told me you salute
not
    at the court, but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be
    uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
TOUCHSTONE.
Instance, briefly; come, instance.
CORIN.
Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells,
you
    know, are greasy.
TOUCHSTONE.
Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat?
And is not
the
    grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man?
Shallow,
    shallow.
A better instance, I say; come.
CORIN.
Besides, our hands are hard.
TOUCHSTONE.
Your lips will feel them the sooner.
Shallow again.
A
    more sounder instance; come.
CORIN.
And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our
    sheep; and would you have us kiss tar?
The courtier's hands
are
    perfum'd with civet.
TOUCHSTONE.
Most shallow man!
thou worm's meat in respect of a
good
    piece of flesh indeed!
Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet
is
    of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat.
Mend
    the instance, shepherd.
CORIN.
You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.
TOUCHSTONE.
Wilt thou rest damn'd?
God help thee, shallow man!
God
    make incision in thee!
thou art raw.
CORIN.
Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I
    wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other
    men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my
pride is
    to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.
TOUCHSTONE.
That is another simple sin in you: to bring the
ewes
    and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the
    copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to
betray
    a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly
ram,
    out of all reasonable match.
If thou beest not damn'd for
this,
    the devil himself will have no shepherds; I cannot see else
how
    thou shouldst scape.
CORIN.
Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's
brother.
Enter ROSALIND, reading a paper
  ROSALIND.
'From the east to western Inde,


              No jewel is like Rosalinde.
Her worth, being mounted on the wind,


              Through all the world bears Rosalinde.
All the pictures fairest lin'd


              Are but black to Rosalinde.
Let no face be kept in mind


              But the fair of Rosalinde.'
TOUCHSTONE.
I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners,


and


    suppers, and sleeping hours, excepted.
It is the right


    butter-women's rank to market.
ROSALIND.
Out, fool!
TOUCHSTONE.
For a taste:


                If a hart do lack a hind,


                Let him seek out Rosalinde.
If the cat will after kind,


                So be sure will Rosalinde.
Winter garments must be lin'd,


                So must slender Rosalinde.
They that reap must sheaf and bind,


                Then to cart with Rosalinde.
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,


                Such a nut is Rosalinde.
He that sweetest rose will find


                Must find love's prick and Rosalinde.
This is the very false gallop of verses; why do you infect


    yourself with them?
ROSALIND.
Peace, you dull fool!
I found them on a tree.
TOUCHSTONE.
Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
ROSALIND.
I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it


with a


    medlar.
Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country;


for


    you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that's the right


    virtue of the medlar.
TOUCHSTONE.
You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the


forest


    judge.
Enter CELIA, with a writing
  ROSALIND.
Peace!
Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.
CELIA.
'Why should this a desert be?
For it is unpeopled?
No;


           Tongues I'll hang on every tree


             That shall civil sayings show.
Some, how brief the life of man


             Runs his erring pilgrimage,


           That the streching of a span


             Buckles in his sum of age;


           Some, of violated vows


             'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;


           But upon the fairest boughs,


             Or at every sentence end,


           Will I Rosalinda write,


             Teaching all that read to know


           The quintessence of every sprite


             Heaven would in little show.
Therefore heaven Nature charg'd


             That one body should be fill'd


           With all graces wide-enlarg'd.
Nature presently distill'd


           Helen's cheek, but not her heart,


             Cleopatra's majesty,


           Atalanta's better part,


             Sad Lucretia's modesty.
Thus Rosalinde of many parts


             By heavenly synod was devis'd,


           Of many faces, eyes, and hearts,


             To have the touches dearest priz'd.
Heaven would that she these gifts should have,


           And I to live and die her slave.'
ROSALIND.
O most gentle Jupiter!
What tedious homily of love


have


    you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have


    patience, good people.'
CELIA.
How now!
Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go


with


    him, sirrah.
TOUCHSTONE.
Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;


    though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and


scrippage.
Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE


  CELIA.
Didst thou hear these verses?
ROSALIND.
O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of


them


    had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
CELIA.
That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
ROSALIND.
Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear


themselves


    without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.
CELIA.
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name


should be


    hang'd and carved upon these trees?
ROSALIND.
I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before


you


    came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree.
I was never


so


    berhym'd since Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat,


which I


    can hardly remember.
CELIA.
Trow you who hath done this?
ROSALIND.
Is it a man?
CELIA.
And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
Change you colour?
ROSALIND.
I prithee, who?
CELIA.
O Lord, Lord!
it is a hard matter for friends to meet;


but


    mountains may be remov'd with earthquakes, and so encounter.
ROSALIND.
Nay, but who is it?
CELIA.
Is it possible?
ROSALIND.
Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence,


tell


    me who it is.
CELIA.
O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and


yet


    again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!
ROSALIND.
Good my complexion!
dost thou think, though I am


    caparison'd like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my


    disposition?
One inch of delay more is a South Sea of


discovery.
I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace.
I would


    thou could'st stammer, that thou mightst pour this conceal'd


man


    out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouth'd bottle-


    either too much at once or none at all.
I prithee take the


cork


    out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.
CELIA.
So you may put a man in your belly.
ROSALIND.
Is he of God's making?
What manner of man?
Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?
CELIA.
Nay, he hath but a little beard.
ROSALIND.
Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful.
Let


    me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the


    knowledge of his chin.
CELIA.
It is young Orlando, that tripp'd up the wrestler's


heels


    and your heart both in an instant.
ROSALIND.
Nay, but the devil take mocking!
Speak sad brow and


true


    maid.
CELIA.
I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
ROSALIND.
Orlando?
CELIA.
Orlando.
ROSALIND.
Alas the day!
what shall I do with my doublet and


hose?
What did he when thou saw'st him?
What said he?
How look'd


he?
Wherein went he?
What makes he here?
Did he ask for me?
Where


    remains he?
How parted he with thee?
And when shalt thou see


him


    again?
Answer me in one word.
CELIA.
You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word


too


    great for any mouth of this age's size.
To say ay and no to


these


    particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.
ROSALIND.
But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in


man's


    apparel?
Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?
CELIA.
It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the


    propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him,


and


    relish it with good observance.
I found him under a tree,


like a


    dropp'd acorn.
ROSALIND.
It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops


forth


    such fruit.
CELIA.
Give me audience, good madam.
ROSALIND.
Proceed.
CELIA.
There lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight.
ROSALIND.
Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well


becomes


    the ground.
CELIA.
Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets


    unseasonably.
He was furnish'd like a hunter.
ROSALIND.
O, ominous!
he comes to kill my heart.
CELIA.
I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me


out


    of tune.
ROSALIND.
Do you not know I am a woman?
When I think, I must


speak.
Sweet, say on.
CELIA.
You bring me out.
Soft!
comes he not here?
Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES
  ROSALIND.
'Tis he; slink by, and note him.
JAQUES.
I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had as


    lief have been myself alone.
ORLANDO.
And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you


too


    for your society.
JAQUES.
God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.
ORLANDO.
I do desire we may be better strangers.
JAQUES.
I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in


    their barks.
ORLANDO.
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them


    ill-favouredly.
JAQUES.
Rosalind is your love's name?
ORLANDO.
Yes, just.
JAQUES.
I do not like her name.
ORLANDO.
There was no thought of pleasing you when she was


    christen'd.
JAQUES.
What stature is she of?
ORLANDO.
Just as high as my heart.
JAQUES.
You are full of pretty answers.
Have you not been


    acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conn'd them out of


rings?
ORLANDO.
Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from


whence


    you have studied your questions.
JAQUES.
You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's


    heels.
Will you sit down with me?
and we two will rail


against


    our mistress the world, and all our misery.
ORLANDO.
I will chide no breather in the world but myself,


against


    whom I know most faults.
JAQUES.
The worst fault you have is to be in love.
ORLANDO.
'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
I


am


    weary of you.
JAQUES.
By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.
ORLANDO.
He is drown'd in the brook; look but in, and you shall


see


    him.
JAQUES.
There I shall see mine own figure.
ORLANDO.
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
JAQUES.
I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior


Love.
ORLANDO.
I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur


    Melancholy.
Exit JAQUES


  ROSALIND.
[Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy
lackey,
    and under that habit play the knave with him.- Do you hear,
    forester?
ORLANDO.
Very well; what would you?
ROSALIND.
I pray you, what is't o'clock?
ORLANDO.
You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock
in
    the forest.
ROSALIND.
Then there is no true lover in the forest, else
sighing
    every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy
foot
    of Time as well as a clock.
ORLANDO.
And why not the swift foot of Time?
Had not that been
as
    proper?
ROSALIND.
By no means, sir.
Time travels in divers paces with
    divers persons.
I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who
Time
    trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands
still
    withal.
ORLANDO.
I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
ROSALIND.
Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
    contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd; if the
    interim be but a se'nnight, Time's pace is so hard that it
seems
    the length of seven year.
ORLANDO.
Who ambles Time withal?
ROSALIND.
With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
hath
    not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot
study,
    and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one
    lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other
    knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury.
These Time ambles
    withal.
ORLANDO.
Who doth he gallop withal?
ROSALIND.
With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as
softly
    as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
ORLANDO.
Who stays it still withal?
ROSALIND.
With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between
term
    and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.
ORLANDO.
Where dwell you, pretty youth?
ROSALIND.
With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts
of
    the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
ORLANDO.
Are you native of this place?
ROSALIND.
As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
ORLANDO.
Your accent is something finer than you could purchase
in
    so removed a dwelling.
ROSALIND.
I have been told so of many; but indeed an old
religious
    uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an
inland
    man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in
love.
I have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank
God I
    am not a woman, to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as
he
    hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.
ORLANDO.
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
laid
    to the charge of women?
ROSALIND.
There were none principal; they were all like one
another
    as halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his
    fellow-fault came to match it.
ORLANDO.
I prithee recount some of them.
ROSALIND.
No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that
are
    sick.
There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young
    plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes
upon
    hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying
the
    name of Rosalind.
If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would
give
    him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of
love
    upon him.
ORLANDO.
I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me
your
    remedy.
ROSALIND.
There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught
me
    how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure
you
    are not prisoner.
ORLANDO.
What were his marks?
ROSALIND.
A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and
sunken,
    which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have
not;
    a beard neglected, which you have not; but I pardon you for
that,
    for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
revenue.
Then your hose should be ungarter'd, your bonnet unbanded,
your
    sleeve unbutton'd, your shoe untied, and every thing about
you
    demonstrating a careless desolation.
But you are no such man;
you
    are rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving
yourself
    than seeming the lover of any other.
ORLANDO.
Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
ROSALIND.
Me believe it!
You may as soon make her that you love
    believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to
confess
    she does.
That is one of the points in the which women still
give
    the lie to their consciences.
But, in good sooth, are you he
that
    hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?
ORLANDO.
I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind,
I
    am that he, that unfortunate he.
ROSALIND.
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
ORLANDO.
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
ROSALIND.
Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves
as
    well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why
    they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so
    ordinary that the whippers are in love too.
Yet I profess
curing
    it by counsel.
ORLANDO.
Did you ever cure any so?
ROSALIND.
Yes, one; and in this manner.
He was to imagine me
his
    love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me; at
which
    time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be
effeminate,
    changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish,
    shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every
    passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys
and
    women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now
like
    him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him;
now
    weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from
his
    mad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was,
to
    forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook
    merely monastic.
And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I
take
    upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart,
    that there shall not be one spot of love in 't.
ORLANDO.
I would not be cured, youth.
ROSALIND.
I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind,
and
    come every day to my cote and woo me.
ORLANDO.
Now, by the faith of my love, I will.
Tell me where it
is.
ROSALIND.
Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the
way,
    you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
Will you go?
ORLANDO.
With all my heart, good youth.
ROSALIND.
Nay, you must call me Rosalind.
Come, sister, will
you
    go?
Exeunt
Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind
  TOUCHSTONE.
Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your


goats,


    Audrey.
And how, Audrey, am I the man yet?
Doth my simple


feature


    content you?
AUDREY.
Your features!
Lord warrant us!
What features?
TOUCHSTONE.
I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most


    capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
JAQUES.
[Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a


    thatch'd house!
TOUCHSTONE.
When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a


man's


    good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it


    strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little


room.
Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.
AUDREY.
I do not know what 'poetical' is.
Is it honest in deed


and


    word?
Is it a true thing?
TOUCHSTONE.
No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most


feigning,


    and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry


may


    be said as lovers they do feign.
AUDREY.
Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
TOUCHSTONE.
I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art


honest;


    now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst


    feign.
AUDREY.
Would you not have me honest?
TOUCHSTONE.
No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for


honesty


    coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
JAQUES.
[Aside] A material fool!
AUDREY.
Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make


me


    honest.
TOUCHSTONE.
Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut


were


    to put good meat into an unclean dish.
AUDREY.
I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
TOUCHSTONE.
Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;


    sluttishness may come hereafter.
But be it as it may be, I


will


    marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver


Martext,


    the vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meet me


in


    this place of the forest, and to couple us.
JAQUES.
[Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
AUDREY.
Well, the gods give us joy!
TOUCHSTONE.
Amen.
A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,


stagger


    in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no


    assembly but horn-beasts.
But what though?
Courage!
As horns


are


    odious, they are necessary.
It is said: 'Many a man knows no


end


    of his goods.'
Right!
Many a man has good horns and knows no


end


    of them.
Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of


his


    own getting.
Horns?
Even so.
Poor men alone?
No, no; the


noblest


    deer hath them as huge as the rascal.
Is the single man


therefore


    blessed?
No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a


village, so


    is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the


bare


    brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no


    skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want.
Here


comes


    Sir Oliver.
Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
    Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met.
Will you dispatch us


here


    under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?
MARTEXT.
Is there none here to give the woman?
TOUCHSTONE.
I will not take her on gift of any man.
MARTEXT.
Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not


lawful.
JAQUES.
[Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.
TOUCHSTONE.
Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you,


sir?
You are very well met.
Goddild you for your last company.
I


am


    very glad to see you.
Even a toy in hand here, sir.
Nay; pray


be


    cover'd.
JAQUES.
Will you be married, motley?
TOUCHSTONE.
As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb,


and


    the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons


    bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
JAQUES.
And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married


    under a bush, like a beggar?
Get you to church and have a


good


    priest that can tell you what marriage is; this fellow will


but


    join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will


    prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber warp, warp.
TOUCHSTONE.
[Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to


be


    married of him than of another; for he is not like to marry


me


    well; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse


for me


    hereafter to leave my wife.
JAQUES.
Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
TOUCHSTONE.
Come, sweet Audrey;


    We must be married or we must live in bawdry.
Farewell, good Master Oliver.
Not-


               O sweet Oliver,


               O brave Oliver,


           Leave me not behind thee.
But-


                 Wind away,


               Begone, I say,


           I will not to wedding with thee.
Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE, and AUDREY


  MARTEXT.
'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all


    shall flout me out of my calling.
Exit


Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
  ROSALIND.
Never talk to me; I will weep.
CELIA.
Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that


tears


    do not become a man.
ROSALIND.
But have I not cause to weep?
CELIA.
As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
ROSALIND.
His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
CELIA.
Something browner than Judas's.
Marry, his kisses are Judas's own children.
ROSALIND.
I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
CELIA.
An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only


colour.
ROSALIND.
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch


of


    holy bread.
CELIA.
He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana.
A nun of


    winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice


of


    chastity is in them.
ROSALIND.
But why did he swear he would come this morning, and


    comes not?
CELIA.
Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
ROSALIND.
Do you think so?
CELIA.
Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer;


but


    for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered


    goblet or a worm-eaten nut.
ROSALIND.
Not true in love?
CELIA.
Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
ROSALIND.
You have heard him swear downright he was.
CELIA.
'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no


    stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the


confirmer


    of false reckonings.
He attends here in the forest on the


Duke,


    your father.
ROSALIND.
I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with


him.
He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good


as


    he; so he laugh'd and let me go.
But what talk we of fathers


when


    there is such a man as Orlando?
CELIA.
O, that's a brave man!
He writes brave verses, speaks


brave


    words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite


    traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puny tilter,


that


    spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a


noble


    goose.
But all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides.
Who


    comes here?
Enter CORIN
  CORIN.
Mistress and master, you have oft enquired


    After the shepherd that complain'd of love,


    Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,


    Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess


    That was his mistress.
CELIA.
Well, and what of him?
CORIN.
If you will see a pageant truly play'd


    Between the pale complexion of true love


    And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,


    Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,


    If you will mark it.
ROSALIND.
O, come, let us remove!
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
Bring us to this sight, and you shall say


    I'll prove a busy actor in their play.
Exeunt


Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
  SILVIUS.
Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.
Say that you love me not; but say not so


    In bitterness.
The common executioner,


    Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard,


    Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck


    But first begs pardon.
Will you sterner be


    Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, at a distance
  PHEBE.
I would not be thy executioner;


    I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye.
'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,


    That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,


    Who shut their coward gates on atomies,


    Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;


    And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.
Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;


    Or, if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,


    Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.
Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains


    Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,


    The cicatrice and capable impressure


    Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,


    Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;


    Nor, I am sure, there is not force in eyes


    That can do hurt.
SILVIUS.
O dear Phebe,


    If ever- as that ever may be near-


    You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,


    Then shall you know the wounds invisible


    That love's keen arrows make.
PHEBE.
But till that time


    Come not thou near me; and when that time comes,


    Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;


    As till that time I shall not pity thee.
ROSALIND.
[Advancing] And why, I pray you?
Who might be your


      mother,


    That you insult, exult, and all at once,


    Over the wretched?
What though you have no beauty-


    As, by my faith, I see no more in you


    Than without candle may go dark to bed-


    Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
Why, what means this?
Why do you look on me?
I see no more in you than in the ordinary


    Of nature's sale-work.
'Od's my little life,


    I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
No faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;


    'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,


    Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,


    That can entame my spirits to your worship.
You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,


    Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?
You are a thousand times a properer man


    Than she a woman.
'Tis such fools as you


    That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children.
'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;


    And out of you she sees herself more proper


    Than any of her lineaments can show her.
But, mistress, know yourself.
Down on your knees,


    And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;


    For I must tell you friendly in your ear:


    Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;


    Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
So take her to thee, shepherd.
Fare you well.
PHEBE.
Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;


    I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
ROSALIND.
He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll


fall


    in love with my anger.
If it be so, as fast as she answers


thee


    with frowning looks, I'll sauce her with bitter words.
Why


look


    you so upon me?
PHEBE.
For no ill will I bear you.
ROSALIND.
I pray you do not fall in love with me,


    For I am falser than vows made in wine;


    Besides, I like you not.
If you will know my house,


    'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
Will you go, sister?
Shepherd, ply her hard.
Come, sister.
Shepherdess, look on him better,


    And be not proud; though all the world could see,


    None could be so abus'd in sight as he.
Come, to our flock.
Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN


  PHEBE.
Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:


    'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?'
SILVIUS.
Sweet Phebe.
PHEBE.
Ha!
what say'st thou, Silvius?
SILVIUS.
Sweet Phebe, pity me.
PHEBE.
Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
SILVIUS.
Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
If you do sorrow at my grief in love,


    By giving love, your sorrow and my grief


    Were both extermin'd.
PHEBE.
Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
SILVIUS.
I would have you.
PHEBE.
Why, that were covetousness.
Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;


    And yet it is not that I bear thee love;


    But since that thou canst talk of love so well,


    Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,


    I will endure; and I'll employ thee too.
But do not look for further recompense


    Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
SILVIUS.
So holy and so perfect is my love,


    And I in such a poverty of grace,


    That I shall think it a most plenteous crop


    To glean the broken ears after the man


    That the main harvest reaps; loose now and then


    A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
PHEBE.
Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
SILVIUS.
Not very well; but I have met him oft;


    And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds


    That the old carlot once was master of.
PHEBE.
Think not I love him, though I ask for him;


    'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.
But what care I for words?
Yet words do well


    When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
It is a pretty youth- not very pretty;


    But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him.
He'll make a proper man.
The best thing in him


    Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue


    Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.
He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall;


    His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.
There was a pretty redness in his lip,


    A little riper and more lusty red


    Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference


    Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him


    In parcels as I did, would have gone near


    To fall in love with him; but, for my part,


    I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet


    I have more cause to hate him than to love him;


    For what had he to do to chide at me?
He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,


    And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.
I marvel why I answer'd not again;


    But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.
I'll write to him a very taunting letter,


    And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?
SILVIUS.
Phebe, with all my heart.
PHEBE.
I'll write it straight;


    The matter's in my head and in my heart;


    I will be bitter with him and passing short.
Go with me, Silvius.
Exeunt

Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES
  JAQUES.
I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted


with


    thee.
ROSALIND.
They say you are a melancholy fellow.
JAQUES.
I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
ROSALIND.
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable


    fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse


than


    drunkards.
JAQUES.
Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
ROSALIND.
Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
JAQUES.
I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is


    emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical; nor the


    courtier's, which is proud; nor the soldier's, which is


    ambitious; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor the


lady's,


    which is nice; nor the lover's, which is all these; but it is


a


    melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted


    from many objects, and, indeed, the sundry contemplation of


my


    travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most


humorous


    sadness.
ROSALIND.
A traveller!
By my faith, you have great reason to be


    sad.
I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's;


then


    to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes


and


    poor hands.
JAQUES.
Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
Enter ORLANDO
  ROSALIND.
And your experience makes you sad.
I had rather have
a
    fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to
    travel for it too.
ORLANDO.
Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
JAQUES.
Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
ROSALIND.
Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
    strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country,
be
    out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for
making
    you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have
    swam in a gondola.
[Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando!
where
    have you been all this while?
You a lover!
An you serve me
such
    another trick, never come in my sight more.
ORLANDO.
My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
ROSALIND.
Break an hour's promise in love!
He that will divide
a
    minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the
    thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be
said
    of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'll
    warrant him heart-whole.
ORLANDO.
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
ROSALIND.
Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight.
I
had
    as lief be woo'd of a snail.
ORLANDO.
Of a snail!
ROSALIND.
Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he
carries
    his house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you
make
    a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.
ORLANDO.
What's that?
ROSALIND.
Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be
beholding to
    your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and
prevents
    the slander of his wife.
ORLANDO.
Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
ROSALIND.
And I am your Rosalind.
CELIA.
It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of
a
    better leer than you.
ROSALIND.
Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday
humour,
    and like enough to consent.
What would you say to me now, an
I
    were your very very Rosalind?
ORLANDO.
I would kiss before I spoke.
ROSALIND.
Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
    gravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to
kiss.
Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for
    lovers lacking- God warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is
to
    kiss.
ORLANDO.
How if the kiss be denied?
ROSALIND.
Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
    matter.
ORLANDO.
Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
ROSALIND.
Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
    should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
ORLANDO.
What, of my suit?
ROSALIND.
Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
Am not I your Rosalind?
ORLANDO.
I take some joy to say you are, because I would be
talking
    of her.
ROSALIND.
Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
ORLANDO.
Then, in mine own person, I die.
ROSALIND.
No, faith, die by attorney.
The poor world is almost
six
    thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any
man
    died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause.
Troilus
had
    his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
    could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.
Leander, he would have liv'd many a fair year, though Hero
had
    turn'd nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night;
for,
    good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont,
and,
    being taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the foolish
    chroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos.
But
these
    are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have
    eaten them, but not for love.
ORLANDO.
I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for,
I
    protest, her frown might kill me.
ROSALIND.
By this hand, it will not kill a fly.
But come, now I
    will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and
ask me
    what you will, I will grant it.
ORLANDO.
Then love me, Rosalind.
ROSALIND.
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
ORLANDO.
And wilt thou have me?
ROSALIND.
Ay, and twenty such.
ORLANDO.
What sayest thou?
ROSALIND.
Are you not good?
ORLANDO.
I hope so.
ROSALIND.
Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
Come,
    sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us.
Give me your
hand,
    Orlando.
What do you say, sister?
ORLANDO.
Pray thee, marry us.
CELIA.
I cannot say the words.
ROSALIND.
You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
  CELIA.
Go to.
Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
ORLANDO.
I will.
ROSALIND.
Ay, but when?
ORLANDO.
Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
ROSALIND.
Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
ORLANDO.
I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
ROSALIND.
I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take
thee,
    Orlando, for my husband.
There's a girl goes before the
priest;
    and, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions.
ORLANDO.
So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
ROSALIND.
Now tell me how long you would have her, after you
have
    possess'd her.
ORLANDO.
For ever and a day.
ROSALIND.
Say 'a day' without the 'ever.'
No, no, Orlando; men
are
    April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May
when
    they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives.
I
will
    be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his
hen,
    more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled
than
    an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey.
I will weep
for
    nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when
you
    are dispos'd to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that
when
    thou are inclin'd to sleep.
ORLANDO.
But will my Rosalind do so?
ROSALIND.
By my life, she will do as I do.
ORLANDO.
O, but she is wise.
ROSALIND.
Or else she could not have the wit to do this.
The
wiser,
    the waywarder.
Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will
out
    at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole;
stop
    that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
ORLANDO.
A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say
'Wit,
    whither wilt?'
ROSALIND.
Nay, you might keep that check for
it, till you met your
    wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
ORLANDO.
And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
ROSALIND.
Marry, to say she came to seek you there.
You shall
never
    take her without her answer, unless you take her without her
    tongue.
O, that woman that cannot make her fault her
husband's
    occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will
    breed it like a fool!
ORLANDO.
For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
ROSALIND.
Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
ORLANDO.
I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I
will be
    with thee again.
ROSALIND.
Ay, go your ways, go your ways.
I knew what you would
    prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less.
That
    flattering tongue of yours won me.
'Tis but one cast away,
and
    so, come death!
Two o'clock is your hour?
ORLANDO.
Ay, sweet Rosalind.
ROSALIND.
By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me,
and
    by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one
jot
    of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will
    think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most
hollow
    lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that
may
    be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful.
Therefore
    beware my censure, and keep your promise.
ORLANDO.
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
    Rosalind; so, adieu.
ROSALIND.
Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
    offenders, and let Time try.
Adieu.
Exit ORLANDO
  CELIA.
You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate.
We
must
    have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head, and show
the
    world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
ROSALIND.
O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
didst
    know how many fathom deep I am in love!
But it cannot be
sounded;
    my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of
Portugal.
CELIA.
Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour
affection
    in, it runs out.
ROSALIND.
No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot
of
    thought, conceiv'd of spleen, and born of madness; that blind
    rascally boy, that abuses every one's eyes, because his own
are
    out- let him be judge how deep I am in love.
I'll tell thee,
    Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando.
I'll go find
a
    shadow, and sigh till he come.
CELIA.
And I'll sleep.
Exeunt
        Enter JAQUES and LORDS, in the habit of foresters
  JAQUES.
Which is he that killed the deer?
LORD.
Sir, it was I.


  JAQUES.
Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror;


and


    it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a


    branch of victory.
Have you no song, forester, for this


purpose?
LORD.
Yes, sir.
JAQUES.
Sing it; 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make


noise


    enough.
What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
His leather skin and horns to wear.
[The rest shall hear this burden:]


           Then sing him home.
Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;


      It was a crest ere thou wast born.
Thy father's father wore it;


           And thy father bore it.
The horn, the horn, the lusty horn,


      Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.
Exeunt


Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
  ROSALIND.
How say you now?
Is it not past two o'clock?
And here much Orlando!
CELIA.
I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he


hath


    ta'en his bow and arrows, and is gone forth- to sleep.
Look,


who


    comes here.
Enter SILVIUS
  SILVIUS.
My errand is to you, fair youth;


    My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this.
I know not the contents; but, as I guess


    By the stern brow and waspish action


    Which she did use as she was writing of it,


    It bears an angry tenour.
Pardon me,


    I am but as a guiltless messenger.
ROSALIND.
Patience herself would startle at this letter,


    And play the swaggerer.
Bear this, bear all.
She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;


    She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,


    Were man as rare as Phoenix.
'Od's my will!
Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;


    Why writes she so to me?
Well, shepherd, well,


    This is a letter of your own device.
SILVIUS.
No, I protest, I know not the contents;


    Phebe did write it.
ROSALIND.
Come, come, you are a fool,


    And turn'd into the extremity of love.
I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,


    A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think


    That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands;


    She has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter.
I say she never did invent this letter:


    This is a man's invention, and his hand.
SILVIUS.
Sure, it is hers.
ROSALIND.
Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;


    A style for challengers.
Why, she defies me,


    Like Turk to Christian.
Women's gentle brain


    Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,


    Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect


    Than in their countenance.
Will you hear the letter?
SILVIUS.
So please you, for I never heard it yet;


    Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
ROSALIND.
She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
[Reads]


            'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,


            That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?'
Can a woman rail thus?
SILVIUS.
Call you this railing?
ROSALIND.
'Why, thy godhead laid apart,


             Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?'
Did you ever hear such railing?
'Whiles the eye of man did woo me,


            That could do no vengeance to me.'
Meaning me a beast.
'If the scorn of your bright eyne


            Have power to raise such love in mine,


            Alack, in me what strange effect


            Would they work in mild aspect!
Whiles you chid me, I did love;


            How then might your prayers move!
He that brings this love to the


            Little knows this love in me;


            And by him seal up thy mind,


            Whether that thy youth and kind


            Will the faithful offer take


            Of me and all that I can make;


            Or else by him my love deny,


            And then I'll study how to die.'
SILVIUS.
Call you this chiding?
CELIA.
Alas, poor shepherd!
ROSALIND.
Do you pity him?
No, he deserves no pity.
Wilt thou


love


    such a woman?
What, to make thee an instrument, and play


false


    strains upon thee!
Not to be endur'd!
Well, go your way to


her,


    for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to


her-


    that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will


not,


    I will never have her unless thou entreat for her.
If you be


a


    true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more


company.
Exit SILVIUS


                         Enter OLIVER
  OLIVER.
Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,


    Where in the purlieus of this forest stands


    A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
CELIA.
West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream


    Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
But at this hour the house doth keep itself;


    There's none within.
OLIVER.
If that an eye may profit by a tongue,


    Then should I know you by description-


    Such garments, and such years: 'The boy is fair,


    Of female favour, and bestows himself


    Like a ripe sister; the woman low,


    And browner than her brother.'
Are not you


    The owner of the house I did inquire for?
CELIA.
It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
OLIVER.
Orlando doth commend him to you both;


    And to that youth he calls his Rosalind


    He sends this bloody napkin.
Are you he?
ROSALIND.
I am.
What must we understand by this?
OLIVER.
Some of my shame; if you will know of me


    What man I am, and how, and why, and where,


    This handkercher was stain'd.
CELIA.
I pray you, tell it.
OLIVER.
When last the young Orlando parted from you,


    He left a promise to return again


    Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,


    Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,


    Lo, what befell!
He threw his eye aside,


    And mark what object did present itself.
Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,


    And high top bald with dry antiquity,


    A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,


    Lay sleeping on his back.
About his neck


    A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,


    Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd


    The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,


    Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,


    And with indented glides did slip away


    Into a bush; under which bush's shade


    A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,


    Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,


    When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis


    The royal disposition of that beast


    To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
This seen, Orlando did approach the man,


    And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
CELIA.
O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;


    And he did render him the most unnatural


    That liv'd amongst men.
OLIVER.
And well he might so do,


    For well I know he was unnatural.
ROSALIND.
But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,


    Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
OLIVER.
Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;


    But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,


    And nature, stronger than his just occasion,


    Made him give battle to the lioness,


    Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling


    From miserable slumber I awak'd.
CELIA.
Are you his brother?
ROSALIND.
Was't you he rescu'd?
CELIA.
Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
OLIVER.
'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame


    To tell you what I was, since my conversion


    So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
ROSALIND.
But for the bloody napkin?
OLIVER.
By and by.
When from the first to last, betwixt us two,


    Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,


    As how I came into that desert place-


    In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,


    Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,


    Committing me unto my brother's love;


    Who led me instantly unto his cave,


    There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm


    The lioness had torn some flesh away,


    Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,


    And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,


    And, after some small space, being strong at heart,


    He sent me hither, stranger as I am,


    To tell this story, that you might excuse


    His broken promise, and to give this napkin,


    Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth


    That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
[ROSALIND swoons]


  CELIA.
Why, how now, Ganymede!
sweet Ganymede!
OLIVER.
Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
CELIA.
There is more in it.
Cousin Ganymede!
OLIVER.
Look, he recovers.
ROSALIND.
I would I were at home.
CELIA.
We'll lead you thither.
I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
OLIVER.
Be of good cheer, youth.
You a man!
You lack a man's heart.
ROSALIND.
I do so, I confess it.
Ah, sirrah, a body would think


    this was well counterfeited.
I pray you tell your brother how


    well I counterfeited.
Heigh-ho!
OLIVER.
This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony


in


    your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
ROSALIND.
Counterfeit, I assure you.
OLIVER.
Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a


man.
ROSALIND.
So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by


    right.
CELIA.
Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
Good sir, go with us.
OLIVER.
That will I, for I must bear answer back


    How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
ROSALIND.
I shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my


    counterfeiting to him.
Will you go?
Exeunt

Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
  TOUCHSTONE.
We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle


Audrey.
AUDREY.
Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old


    gentleman's saying.
TOUCHSTONE.
A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile


Martext.
But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim


to


    you.
AUDREY.
Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the


    world; here comes the man you mean.
Enter WILLIAM
  TOUCHSTONE.
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown.
By my


troth,


    we that have good wits have much to answer for: we shall be


    flouting; we cannot hold.
WILLIAM.
Good ev'n, Audrey.
AUDREY.
God ye good ev'n, William.
WILLIAM.
And good ev'n to you, sir.
TOUCHSTONE.
Good ev'n, gentle friend.
Cover thy head, cover thy


    head; nay, prithee be cover'd.
How old are you, friend?
WILLIAM.
Five and twenty, sir.
TOUCHSTONE.
A ripe age.
Is thy name William?
WILLIAM.
William, sir.
TOUCHSTONE.
A fair name.
Wast born i' th' forest here?
WILLIAM.
Ay, sir, I thank God.
TOUCHSTONE.
'Thank God.'
A good answer.
Art rich?
WILLIAM.
Faith, sir, so so.
TOUCHSTONE.
'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good;


and


    yet it is not; it is but so so.
Art thou wise?
WILLIAM.
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
TOUCHSTONE.
Why, thou say'st well.
I do now remember a saying:


'The


    fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to


be


    a fool.'
The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat


a


    grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;


meaning


    thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open.
You do


    love this maid?
WILLIAM.
I do, sir.
TOUCHSTONE.
Give me your hand.
Art thou learned?
WILLIAM.
No, sir.
TOUCHSTONE.
Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it


is a


    figure in rhetoric that drink, being pour'd out of cup into a


    glass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your


    writers do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse,


for I


    am he.
WILLIAM.
Which he, sir?
TOUCHSTONE.
He, sir, that must marry this woman.
Therefore, you


    clown, abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society-


which


    in the boorish is company- of this female- which in the


common is


    woman- which together is: abandon the society of this female;


or,


    clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding,


diest;


    or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life


into


    death, thy liberty into bondage.
I will deal in poison with


thee,


    or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in


faction;


    will o'er-run thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred


and


    fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.
AUDREY.
Do, good William.
WILLIAM.
God rest you merry, sir.
Exit


                          Enter CORIN
  CORIN.
Our master and mistress seeks you; come away, away.
TOUCHSTONE.
Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey.
I attend, I attend.
Exeunt


Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER
  ORLANDO.
Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you


should


    like her?
that but seeing you should love her?
and loving


woo?
and, wooing, she should grant?
and will you persever to enjoy


    her?
OLIVER.
Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the


poverty


    of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her


sudden


    consenting; but say with me, I love Aliena; say with her that


she


    loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other.
It


    shall be to your good; for my father's house and all the


revenue


    that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you, and here


live


    and die a shepherd.
ORLANDO.
You have my consent.
Let your wedding be to-morrow.
Thither will I invite the Duke and all's contented followers.
Go


    you and prepare Aliena; for, look you, here comes my


Rosalind.
Enter ROSALIND
  ROSALIND.
God save you, brother.
OLIVER.
And you, fair sister.
Exit


  ROSALIND.
O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee


wear


    thy heart in a scarf!
ORLANDO.
It is my arm.
ROSALIND.
I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws


of a


    lion.
ORLANDO.
Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
ROSALIND.
Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to


swoon


    when he show'd me your handkercher?
ORLANDO.
Ay, and greater wonders than that.
ROSALIND.
O, I know where you are.
Nay, 'tis true.
There was


never


    any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar's


    thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame.'
For your


brother


    and my sister no sooner met but they look'd; no sooner look'd


but


    they lov'd; no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd; no sooner sigh'd


but


    they ask'd one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason


but


    they sought the remedy- and in these degrees have they made


pair


    of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or


else


    be incontinent before marriage.
They are in the very wrath of


    love, and they will together.
Clubs cannot part them.
ORLANDO.
They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the


Duke


    to the nuptial.
But, O, how bitter a thing it is to look into


    happiness through another man's eyes!
By so much the more


shall I


    to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I


    shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
ROSALIND.
Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for


    Rosalind?
ORLANDO.
I can live no longer by thinking.
ROSALIND.
I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking.
Know


    of me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you


are


    a gentleman of good conceit.
I speak not this that you should


    bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know


you


    are; neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in


some


    little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good,


and


    not to grace me.
Believe then, if you please, that I can do


    strange things.
I have, since I was three year old, convers'd


    with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not


damnable.
If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture


cries


    it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her.
I


    know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is


not


    impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to


set


    her before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without


any


    danger.
ORLANDO.
Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
ROSALIND.
By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say


I


    am a magician.
Therefore put you in your best array, bid your


    friends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall; and


to


    Rosalind, if you will.
Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
    Look, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.
PHEBE.
Youth, you have done me much ungentleness


    To show the letter that I writ to you.
ROSALIND.
I care not if I have.
It is my study


    To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.
You are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd;


    Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
PHEBE.
Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
SILVIUS.
It is to be all made of sighs and tears;


    And so am I for Phebe.
PHEBE.
And I for Ganymede.
ORLANDO.
And I for Rosalind.
ROSALIND.
And I for no woman.
SILVIUS.
It is to be all made of faith and service;


    And so am I for Phebe.
PHEBE.
And I for Ganymede.
ORLANDO.
And I for Rosalind.
ROSALIND.
And I for no woman.
SILVIUS.
It is to be all made of fantasy,


    All made of passion, and all made of wishes;


    All adoration, duty, and observance,


    All humbleness, all patience, and impatience,


    All purity, all trial, all obedience;


    And so am I for Phebe.
PHEBE.
And so am I for Ganymede.
ORLANDO.
And so am I for Rosalind.
ROSALIND.
And so am I for no woman.
PHEBE.
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
SILVIUS.
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
ORLANDO.
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
ROSALIND.
Why do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
ORLANDO.
To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
ROSALIND.
Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of


Irish


    wolves against the moon.
[To SILVIUS] I will help you if I


can.
[To PHEBE] I would love you if I could.- To-morrow meet me


all


    together.
[ To PHEBE ] I will marry you if ever I marry


woman,


    and I'll be married to-morrow.
[To ORLANDO] I will satisfy


you if


    ever I satisfied man, and you shall be married to-morrow.
[To


    Silvius] I will content you if what pleases you contents you,


and


    you shall be married to-morrow.
[To ORLANDO] As you love


    Rosalind, meet.
[To SILVIUS] As you love Phebe, meet;- and as


I


    love no woman, I'll meet.
So, fare you well; I have left you


    commands.
SILVIUS.
I'll not fail, if I live.
PHEBE.
Nor I.


  ORLANDO.
Nor I.                                         Exeunt


Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
  TOUCHSTONE.
To-morrow is the joyful day, Audrey; to-morrow


will we


    be married.
AUDREY.
I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no


    dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world.
Here


come


    two of the banish'd Duke's pages.
Enter two PAGES
  FIRST PAGE.
Well met, honest gentleman.
TOUCHSTONE.
By my troth, well met.
Come sit, sit, and a song.
SECOND PAGE.
We are for you; sit i' th' middle.
FIRST PAGE.
Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking, or


    spitting, or saying we are hoarse, which are the only


prologues


    to a bad voice?
SECOND PAGE.
I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two


gipsies


    on a horse.
SONG.
It was a lover and his lass,


          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,


        That o'er the green corn-field did pass


          In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,


        When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
Sweet lovers love the spring.
Between the acres of the rye,


          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,


        These pretty country folks would lie,


          In the spring time, &c.


        This carol they began that hour,


          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,


        How that a life was but a flower,


          In the spring time, &c.


        And therefore take the present time,


          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,


        For love is crowned with the prime,


          In the spring time, &c.


  TOUCHSTONE.
Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great


    matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.
FIRST PAGE.
You are deceiv'd, sir; we kept time, we lost not


our


    time.
TOUCHSTONE.
By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear


such


    a foolish song.
God buy you; and God mend your voices.
Come,


    Audrey.
Exeunt


Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA
  DUKE SENIOR.
Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy


    Can do all this that he hath promised?
ORLANDO.
I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not:


    As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE
  ROSALIND.
Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd:


    You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,


    You will bestow her on Orlando here?
DUKE SENIOR.
That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
ROSALIND.
And you say you will have her when I bring her?
ORLANDO.
That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
ROSALIND.
You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?
PHEBE.
That will I, should I die the hour after.
ROSALIND.
But if you do refuse to marry me,


    You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
PHEBE.
So is the bargain.
ROSALIND.
You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
SILVIUS.
Though to have her and death were both one thing.
ROSALIND.
I have promis'd to make all this matter even.
Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter;


    You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;


    Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,


    Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd;


    Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her


    If she refuse me; and from hence I go,


    To make these doubts all even.
Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA


  DUKE SENIOR.
I do remember in this shepherd boy


    Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.
ORLANDO.
My lord, the first time that I ever saw him


    Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,


    And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments


    Of many desperate studies by his uncle,


    Whom he reports to be a great magician,


    Obscured in the circle of this forest.
Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
  JAQUES.
There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples
are
    coming to the ark.
Here comes a pair of very strange beasts
which
    in all tongues are call'd fools.
TOUCHSTONE.
Salutation and greeting to you all!
JAQUES.
Good my lord, bid him welcome.
This is the
motley-minded
    gentleman that I have so often met in the forest.
He hath
been a
     courtier, he swears.
TOUCHSTONE.
If any man doubt that, let him put me to my
purgation.
I have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been
    politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone
    three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have
fought
    one.
JAQUES.
And how was that ta'en up?
TOUCHSTONE.
Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
    seventh cause.
JAQUES.
How seventh cause?
Good my lord, like this fellow.
DUKE SENIOR.
I like him very well.
TOUCHSTONE.
God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like.
I
press in
    here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to
swear
    and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood
breaks.
A
    poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a
    poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will.
Rich
    honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your
pearl
    in your foul oyster.
DUKE SENIOR.
By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
TOUCHSTONE.
According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet
    diseases.
JAQUES.
But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the
quarrel on
    the seventh cause?
TOUCHSTONE.
Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more
    seeming, Audrey- as thus, sir.
I did dislike the cut of a
certain
    courtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was
not
    cut well, he was in the mind it was.
This is call'd the
Retort
    Courteous.
If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he
would
    send me word he cut it to please himself.
This is call'd the
Quip
    Modest.
If again it was not well cut, he disabled my
judgment.
This is call'd the Reply Churlish.
If again it was not well
cut,
    he would answer I spake not true.
This is call'd the Reproof
    Valiant.
If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie.
This
    is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome.
And so to the Lie
    Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
JAQUES.
And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
TOUCHSTONE.
I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,
nor
    he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd
swords
    and parted.
JAQUES.
Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
TOUCHSTONE.
O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you
have
    books for good manners.
I will name you the degrees.
The
first,
    the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third,
the
    Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth,
the
    Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with
Circumstance;
    the seventh, the Lie Direct.
All these you may avoid but the
Lie
    Direct; and you may avoid that too with an If.
I knew when
seven
    justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties
were
    met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you
    said so, then I said so.'
And they shook hands, and swore


    brothers.
Your If is the only peace-maker; much virtue in If.
JAQUES.
Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?
He's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.
DUKE SENIOR.
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under


the


    presentation of that he shoots his wit.
Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA.
Still MUSIC
    HYMEN.
Then is there mirth in heaven,


              When earthly things made even


                Atone together.
Good Duke, receive thy daughter;


              Hymen from heaven brought her,


                Yea, brought her hither,


              That thou mightst join her hand with his,


              Whose heart within his bosom is.
ROSALIND.
[To DUKE] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
[To ORLANDO] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
DUKE SENIOR.
If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
ORLANDO.
If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
PHEBE.
If sight and shape be true,


    Why then, my love adieu!
ROSALIND.
I'll have no father, if you be not he;


    I'll have no husband, if you be not he;


    Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.
HYMEN.
Peace, ho!
I bar confusion;


            'Tis I must make conclusion


              Of these most strange events.
Here's eight that must take hands


            To join in Hymen's bands,


              If truth holds true contents.
You and you no cross shall part;


            You and you are heart in heart;


            You to his love must accord,


            Or have a woman to your lord;


            You and you are sure together,


            As the winter to foul weather.
Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,


            Feed yourselves with questioning,


            That reason wonder may diminish,


            How thus we met, and these things finish.
SONG


            Wedding is great Juno's crown;


              O blessed bond of board and bed!
'Tis Hymen peoples every town;


              High wedlock then be honoured.
Honour, high honour, and renown,


            To Hymen, god of every town!
DUKE SENIOR.
O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.
PHEBE.
I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;


    Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
Enter JAQUES de BOYS
  JAQUES de BOYS.
Let me have audience for a word or two.
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,


    That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day


    Men of great worth resorted to this forest,


    Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,


    In his own conduct, purposely to take


    His brother here, and put him to the sword;


    And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,


    Where, meeting with an old religious man,


    After some question with him, was converted


    Both from his enterprise and from the world;


    His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,


    And all their lands restor'd to them again


    That were with him exil'd.
This to be true


    I do engage my life.
DUKE SENIOR.
Welcome, young man.
Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:


    To one, his lands withheld; and to the other,


    A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
First, in this forest let us do those ends


    That here were well begun and well begot;


    And after, every of this happy number,


    That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us,


    Shall share the good of our returned fortune,


    According to the measure of their states.
Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,


    And fall into our rustic revelry.
Play, music; and you brides and bridegrooms all,


    With measure heap'd in joy, to th' measures fall.
JAQUES.
Sir, by your patience.
If I heard you rightly,


    The Duke hath put on a religious life,


    And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
JAQUES DE BOYS.
He hath.
JAQUES.
To him will I.
Out of these convertites


    There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.
[To DUKE] You to your former honour I bequeath;


    Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.
[To ORLANDO] You to a love that your true faith doth merit;


    [To OLIVER] You to your land, and love, and great allies


    [To SILVIUS] You to a long and well-deserved bed;


    [To TOUCHSTONE] And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage


    Is but for two months victuall'd.- So to your pleasures;


    I am for other than for dancing measures.
DUKE SENIOR.
Stay, Jaques, stay.
JAQUES.
To see no pastime I.
What you would have


    I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.
Exit


  DUKE SENIOR.
Proceed, proceed.
We will begin these rites,


    As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.
[A dance]


Exeunt


EPILOGUE


                           EPILOGUE.
ROSALIND.
It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;


but


    it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue.

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.
The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.
This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.
If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.
[10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]

Enter ANTONIO, SALERIO, and SOLANIO
  ANTONIO.
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad.
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;


    But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,


    What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,


    I am to learn;


    And such a want-wit sadness makes of me


    That I have much ado to know myself.
SALERIO.
Your mind is tossing on the ocean;


    There where your argosies, with portly sail-


    Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,


    Or as it were the pageants of the sea-


    Do overpeer the petty traffickers,


    That curtsy to them, do them reverence,


    As they fly by them with their woven wings.
SOLANIO.
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,


    The better part of my affections would


    Be with my hopes abroad.
I should be still


    Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,


    Peering in maps for ports, and piers, and roads;


    And every object that might make me fear


    Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt,


    Would make me sad.
SALERIO.
My wind, cooling my broth,


    Would blow me to an ague when I thought


    What harm a wind too great might do at sea.
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run


    But I should think of shallows and of flats,


    And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,


    Vailing her high top lower than her ribs


    To kiss her burial.
Should I go to church


    And see the holy edifice of stone,


    And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,


    Which, touching but my gentle vessel's side,


    Would scatter all her spices on the stream,


    Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,


    And, in a word, but even now worth this,


    And now worth nothing?
Shall I have the thought


    To think on this, and shall I lack the thought


    That such a thing bechanc'd would make me sad?
But tell not me; I know Antonio


    Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
ANTONIO.
Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it,


    My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,


    Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate


    Upon the fortune of this present year;


    Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
SOLANIO.
Why then you are in love.
ANTONIO.
Fie, fie!
SOLANIO.
Not in love neither?
Then let us say you are sad


    Because you are not merry; and 'twere as easy


    For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,


    Because you are not sad.
Now, by two-headed Janus,


    Nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her time:


    Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,


    And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper;


    And other of such vinegar aspect


    That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile


    Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO
    Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,


    Gratiano and Lorenzo.
Fare ye well;


    We leave you now with better company.
SALERIO.
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,


    If worthier friends had not prevented me.
ANTONIO.
Your worth is very dear in my regard.
I take it your own business calls on you,


    And you embrace th' occasion to depart.
SALERIO.
Good morrow, my good lords.
BASSANIO.
Good signiors both, when shall we laugh?
Say when.
You grow exceeding strange; must it be so?
SALERIO.
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO


  LORENZO.
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,


    We two will leave you; but at dinner-time,


    I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
BASSANIO.
I will not fail you.
GRATIANO.
You look not well, Signior Antonio;


    You have too much respect upon the world;


    They lose it that do buy it with much care.
Believe me, you are marvellously chang'd.
ANTONIO.
I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano-


    A stage, where every man must play a part,


    And mine a sad one.
GRATIANO.
Let me play the fool.
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come;


    And let my liver rather heat with wine


    Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
Why should a man whose blood is warm within


    Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster,


    Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice


    By being peevish?
I tell thee what, Antonio-


    I love thee, and 'tis my love that speaks-


    There are a sort of men whose visages


    Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,


    And do a wilful stillness entertain,


    With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion


    Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit;


    As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,


    And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.'
O my Antonio, I do know of these


    That therefore only are reputed wise


    For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,


    If they should speak, would almost damn those ears


    Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
I'll tell thee more of this another time.
But fish not with this melancholy bait


    For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
Come, good Lorenzo.
Fare ye well awhile;


    I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
LORENZO.
Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,


    For Gratiano never lets me speak.
GRATIANO.
Well, keep me company but two years moe,


    Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
ANTONIO.
Fare you well; I'll grow a talker for this gear.
GRATIANO.
Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable


    In a neat's tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.
Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO


  ANTONIO.
Is that anything now?
BASSANIO.
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more


than


    any man in all Venice.
His reasons are as two grains of wheat


hid


    in, two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find


    them, and when you have them they are not worth the search.
ANTONIO.
Well; tell me now what lady is the same


    To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,


    That you to-day promis'd to tell me of?
BASSANIO.
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,


    How much I have disabled mine estate


    By something showing a more swelling port


    Than my faint means would grant continuance;


    Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'd


    From such a noble rate; but my chief care


    Is to come fairly off from the great debts


    Wherein my time, something too prodigal,


    Hath left me gag'd.
To you, Antonio,


    I owe the most, in money and in love;


    And from your love I have a warranty


    To unburden all my plots and purposes


    How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
ANTONIO.
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;


    And if it stand, as you yourself still do,


    Within the eye of honour, be assur'd


    My purse, my person, my extremest means,


    Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.
BASSANIO.
In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,


    I shot his fellow of the self-same flight


    The self-same way, with more advised watch,


    To find the other forth; and by adventuring both


    I oft found both.
I urge this childhood proof,


    Because what follows is pure innocence.
I owe you much; and, like a wilful youth,


    That which I owe is lost; but if you please


    To shoot another arrow that self way


    Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,


    As I will watch the aim, or to find both,


    Or bring your latter hazard back again


    And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
ANTONIO.
You know me well, and herein spend but time


    To wind about my love with circumstance;


    And out of doubt you do me now more wrong


    In making question of my uttermost


    Than if you had made waste of all I have.
Then do but say to me what I should do


    That in your knowledge may by me be done,


    And I am prest unto it; therefore, speak.
BASSANIO.
In Belmont is a lady richly left,


    And she is fair and, fairer than that word,


    Of wondrous virtues.
Sometimes from her eyes


    I did receive fair speechless messages.
Her name is Portia- nothing undervalu'd


    To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia.
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth;


    For the four winds blow in from every coast


    Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks


    Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,


    Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strond,


    And many Jasons come in quest of her.
O my Antonio, had I but the means


    To hold a rival place with one of them,


    I have a mind presages me such thrift


    That I should questionless be fortunate.
ANTONIO.
Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;


    Neither have I money nor commodity


    To raise a present sum; therefore go forth,


    Try what my credit can in Venice do;


    That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,


    To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.
Go presently inquire, and so will I,


    Where money is; and I no question make


    To have it of my trust or for my sake.
Exeunt


Enter PORTIA with her waiting-woman, NERISSA
  PORTIA.
By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this
    great world.
NERISSA.
You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
the
    same abundance as your good fortunes are; and yet, for aught
I
    see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that
    starve with nothing.
It is no mean happiness, therefore, to
be
    seated in the mean: superfluity come sooner by white hairs,
but
    competency lives longer.
PORTIA.
Good sentences, and well pronounc'd.
NERISSA.
They would be better, if well followed.
PORTIA.
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do,
    chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes'
    palaces.
It is a good divine that follows his own
instructions; I
    can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be
one
    of the twenty to follow mine own teaching.
The brain may
devise
    laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold
decree;
    such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o'er the meshes of
good
    counsel the cripple.
But this reasoning is not in the fashion
to
    choose me a husband.
O me, the word 'choose'!
I may neither
    choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike; so is the will
of a
    living daughter curb'd by the will of a dead father.
Is it
not
    hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?
NERISSA.
Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their
death
    have good inspirations; therefore the lott'ry that he hath
    devised in these three chests, of gold, silver, and lead-
whereof
    who chooses his meaning chooses you- will no doubt never be
    chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love.
But
    what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these
    princely suitors that are already come?
PORTIA.
I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest them, I
will
    describe them; and according to my description, level at my
    affection.
NERISSA.
First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
PORTIA.
Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk
of
    his horse; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own
good
    parts that he can shoe him himself; I am much afear'd my lady
his
    mother play'd false with a smith.
NERISSA.
Then is there the County Palatine.
PORTIA.
He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'An you
will
    not have me, choose.'
He hears merry tales and smiles not.
I
fear
    he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old,
being so
    full of unmannerly sadness in his youth.
I had rather be
married
    to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of
    these.
God defend me from these two!
NERISSA.
How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
PORTIA.
God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
In
    truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he- why, he
hath a
    horse better than the Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of
    frowning than the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man.
If a
    throstle sing he falls straight a-cap'ring; he will fence
with
    his own shadow; if I should marry him, I should marry twenty
    husbands.
If he would despise me, I would forgive him; for if
he
    love me to madness, I shall never requite him.
NERISSA.
What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of
    England?
PORTIA.
You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not
me,
    nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and
you
    will come into the court and swear that I have a poor
pennyworth
    in the English.
He is a proper man's picture; but alas, who
can
    converse with a dumb-show?
How oddly he is suited!
I think he
    bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his
bonnet
    in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere.
NERISSA.
What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
PORTIA.
That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
borrowed
    a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay
him
    again when he was able; I think the Frenchman became his
surety,
    and seal'd under for another.
NERISSA.
How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's
    nephew?
PORTIA.
Very vilely in the morning when he is sober; and most
    vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk.
When he is best, he
is
    a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little
    better than a beast.
An the worst fall that ever fell, I hope
I
    shall make shift to go without him.
NERISSA.
If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
casket,
    you should refuse to perform your father's will, if you
should
    refuse to accept him.
PORTIA.
Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a
deep
    glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket; for if the
devil be
    within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it.
I
    will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.
NERISSA.
You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
lords;
    they have acquainted me with their determinations, which is
    indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no
more
    suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your
father's
    imposition, depending on the caskets.
PORTIA.
If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste
as
    Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father's
will.
I
    am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable; for there is
not
    one among them but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God
    grant them a fair departure.
NERISSA.
Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
    Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in
company of
    the Marquis of Montferrat?
PORTIA.
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, so was he
call'd.
NERISSA.
True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish
eyes
    look'd upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
PORTIA.
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy
    praise.
Enter a SERVINGMAN
    How now!
what news?
SERVINGMAN.
The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take


their


    leave; and there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the


Prince of


    Morocco, who brings word the Prince his master will be here


    to-night.
PORTIA.
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as


I


    can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his


    approach; if he have the condition of a saint and the


complexion


    of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.
Come, Nerissa.
Sirrah, go before.
Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the


      door.
Exeunt


Enter BASSANIO With SHYLOCK the Jew
  SHYLOCK.
Three thousand ducats- well.
BASSANIO.
Ay, sir, for three months.
SHYLOCK.
For three months- well.
BASSANIO.
For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
SHYLOCK.
Antonio shall become bound- well.
BASSANIO.
May you stead me?
Will you pleasure me?
Shall I know


your


    answer?
SHYLOCK.
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio


bound.
BASSANIO.
Your answer to that.
SHYLOCK.
Antonio is a good man.
BASSANIO.
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
SHYLOCK.
Ho, no, no, no, no; my meaning in saying he is a good


man


    is to have you understand me that he is sufficient; yet his


means


    are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis,


another


    to the Indies; I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he


hath a


    third at Mexico, a fourth for England- and other ventures he


    hath, squand'red abroad.
But ships are but boards, sailors


but


    men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and


    land-thieves- I mean pirates; and then there is the peril of


    waters, winds, and rocks.
The man is, notwithstanding,


    sufficient.
Three thousand ducats- I think I may take his


bond.
BASSANIO.
Be assur'd you may.
SHYLOCK.
I will be assur'd I may; and, that I may be assured, I


    will bethink me.
May I speak with Antonio?
BASSANIO.
If it please you to dine with us.
SHYLOCK.
Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which


your


    prophet, the Nazarite, conjured the devil into!
I will buy


with


    you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so


    following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor


pray


    with you.
What news on the Rialto?
Who is he comes here?
Enter ANTONIO
  BASSANIO.
This is Signior Antonio.
SHYLOCK.
[Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!
I hate him for he is a Christian;


    But more for that in low simplicity


    He lends out money gratis, and brings down


    The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
If I can catch him once upon the hip,


    I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
He hates our sacred nation; and he rails,


    Even there where merchants most do congregate,


    On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,


    Which he calls interest.
Cursed be my tribe


    If I forgive him!
BASSANIO.
Shylock, do you hear?
SHYLOCK.
I am debating of my present store,


    And, by the near guess of my memory,


    I cannot instantly raise up the gross


    Of full three thousand ducats.
What of that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,


    Will furnish me.
But soft!
how many months


    Do you desire?
[To ANTONIO]  Rest you fair, good signior;


    Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
ANTONIO.
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow


    By taking nor by giving of excess,


    Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,


    I'll break a custom.
[To BASSANIO]  Is he yet possess'd


    How much ye would?
SHYLOCK.
Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
ANTONIO.
And for three months.
SHYLOCK.
I had forgot- three months; you told me so.
Well then, your bond; and, let me see- but hear you,


    Methoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow


    Upon advantage.
ANTONIO.
I do never use it.
SHYLOCK.
When Jacob graz'd his uncle Laban's sheep-


    This Jacob from our holy Abram was,


    As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,


    The third possessor; ay, he was the third-


  ANTONIO.
And what of him?
Did he take interest?
SHYLOCK.
No, not take interest; not, as you would say,


    Directly int'rest; mark what Jacob did:


    When Laban and himself were compromis'd


    That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied


    Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,


    In end of autumn turned to the rams;


    And when the work of generation was


    Between these woolly breeders in the act,


    The skilful shepherd pill'd me certain wands,


    And, in the doing of the deed of kind,


    He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,


    Who, then conceiving, did in eaning time


    Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;


    And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
ANTONIO.
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for;


    A thing not in his power to bring to pass,


    But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
Was this inserted to make interest good?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
SHYLOCK.
I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.
But note me, signior.
ANTONIO.
[Aside]  Mark you this, Bassanio,


    The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
An evil soul producing holy witness


    Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,


    A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
SHYLOCK.
Three thousand ducats- 'tis a good round sum.
Three months from twelve; then let me see, the rate-


  ANTONIO.
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
SHYLOCK.
Signior Antonio, many a time and oft


    In the Rialto you have rated me


    About my moneys and my usances;


    Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,


    For suff'rance is the badge of all our tribe;


    You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,


    And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,


    And all for use of that which is mine own.
Well then, it now appears you need my help;


    Go to, then; you come to me, and you say


    'Shylock, we would have moneys.'
You say so-


    You that did void your rheum upon my beard


    And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur


    Over your threshold; moneys is your suit.
What should I say to you?
Should I not say


    'Hath a dog money?
Is it possible


    A cur can lend three thousand ducats?'
Or


    Shall I bend low and, in a bondman's key,


    With bated breath and whisp'ring humbleness,


    Say this:


    'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last,


    You spurn'd me such a day; another time


    You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies


    I'll lend you thus much moneys'?
ANTONIO.
I am as like to call thee so again,


    To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not


    As to thy friends- for when did friendship take


    A breed for barren metal of his friend?-


    But lend it rather to thine enemy,


    Who if he break thou mayst with better face


    Exact the penalty.
SHYLOCK.
Why, look you, how you storm!
I would be friends with you, and have your love,


    Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,


    Supply your present wants, and take no doit


    Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me.
This is kind I offer.
BASSANIO.
This were kindness.
SHYLOCK.
This kindness will I show.
Go with me to a notary, seal me there


    Your single bond, and, in a merry sport,


    If you repay me not on such a day,


    In such a place, such sum or sums as are


    Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit


    Be nominated for an equal pound


    Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken


    In what part of your body pleaseth me.
ANTONIO.
Content, in faith; I'll seal to such a bond,


    And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
BASSANIO.
You shall not seal to such a bond for me;


    I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
ANTONIO.
Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;


    Within these two months- that's a month before


    This bond expires- I do expect return


    Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
SHYLOCK.
O father Abram, what these Christians are,


    Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect


    The thoughts of others!
Pray you, tell me this:


    If he should break his day, what should I gain


    By the exaction of the forfeiture?
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man


    Is not so estimable, profitable neither,


    As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.
I say,


    To buy his favour, I extend this friendship;


    If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;


    And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
ANTONIO.
Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
SHYLOCK.
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;


    Give him direction for this merry bond,


    And I will go and purse the ducats straight,


    See to my house, left in the fearful guard


    Of an unthrifty knave, and presently


    I'll be with you.
ANTONIO.
Hie thee, gentle Jew.
Exit SHYLOCK


    The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.
BASSANIO.
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
ANTONIO.
Come on; in this there can be no dismay;


    My ships come home a month before the day.
Exeunt

Flourish of cornets.
Enter the PRINCE of MOROCCO, a tawny Moor
all in white,
and three or four FOLLOWERS accordingly, with PORTIA, NERISSA,
and train
  PRINCE OF Morocco.
Mislike me not for my complexion,


    The shadowed livery of the burnish'd sun,


    To whom I am a neighbour, and near bred.
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,


    Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,


    And let us make incision for your love


    To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine


    Hath fear'd the valiant; by my love, I swear


    The best-regarded virgins of our clime


    Have lov'd it too.
I would not change this hue,


    Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
PORTIA.
In terms of choice I am not solely led


    By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;


    Besides, the lott'ry of my destiny


    Bars me the right of voluntary choosing.
But, if my father had not scanted me,


    And hedg'd me by his wit to yield myself


    His wife who wins me by that means I told you,


    Yourself, renowned Prince, then stood as fair


    As any comer I have look'd on yet


    For my affection.
PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
Even for that I thank you.
Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets


    To try my fortune.
By this scimitar,


    That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince,


    That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,


    I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look,


    Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,


    Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,


    Yea, mock the lion when 'a roars for prey,


    To win thee, lady.
But, alas the while!
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice


    Which is the better man, the greater throw


    May turn by fortune from the weaker hand.
So is Alcides beaten by his page;


    And so may I, blind Fortune leading me,


    Miss that which one unworthier may attain,


    And die with grieving.
PORTIA.
You must take your chance,


    And either not attempt to choose at all,


    Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong,


    Never to speak to lady afterward


    In way of marriage; therefore be advis'd.
PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
Nor will not; come, bring me unto my chance.
PORTIA.
First, forward to the temple.
After dinner


    Your hazard shall be made.
PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
Good fortune then,


    To make me blest or cursed'st among men!
[Cornets, and exeunt]


Enter LAUNCELOT GOBBO
  LAUNCELOT.
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from


this


    Jew my master.
The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me,


saying


    to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot' or 'good


Gobbo' or


    'good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run


away.'
My conscience says 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take


heed,


    honest Gobbo' or, as aforesaid, 'honest Launcelot Gobbo, do


not


    run; scorn running with thy heels.'
Well, the most courageous


    fiend bids me pack.
'Via!'
says the fiend; 'away!'
says the


    fiend.
'For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind' says the


fiend


    'and run.'
Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my


    heart, says very wisely to me 'My honest friend Launcelot,


being


    an honest man's son' or rather 'an honest woman's son'; for


    indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he


had a


    kind of taste- well, my conscience says 'Launcelot, budge


not.'
'Budge,' says the fiend.
'Budge not,' says my conscience.
'Conscience,' say I, (you counsel well.'
'Fiend,' say I, 'you


    counsel well.'
To be rul'd by my conscience, I should stay


with


    the Jew my master, who- God bless the mark!- is a kind of


devil;


    and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the


fiend,


    who- saving your reverence!- is the devil himself.
Certainly


the


    Jew is the very devil incarnation; and, in my conscience, my


    conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to


counsel


    me to stay with the Jew.
The fiend gives the more friendly


    counsel.
I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment;


I


    will run.
Enter OLD GOBBO, with a basket
  GOBBO.
Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to
    master Jew's?
LAUNCELOT.
[Aside]  O heavens!
This is my true-begotten
father,
    who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me
not.
I will try confusions with him.
GOBBO.
Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to
    master Jew's?
LAUNCELOT.
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,
at
    the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at the very
next
    turning, turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the
Jew's
    house.
GOBBO.
Be God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit!
Can you
tell
    me whether one Launcelot, that dwells with him, dwell with
him or
    no?
LAUNCELOT.
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
[Aside]  Mark
me
    now; now will I raise the waters.- Talk you of young Master
    Launcelot?
GOBBO.
No master, sir, but a poor man's son; his father, though
I
    say't, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked,
well
    to live.
LAUNCELOT.
Well, let his father be what 'a will, we talk of
young
    Master Launcelot.
GOBBO.
Your worship's friend, and Launcelot, sir.
LAUNCELOT.
But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,
talk
    you of young Master Launcelot?
GOBBO.
Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
LAUNCELOT.
Ergo, Master Launcelot.
Talk not of Master
Launcelot,
    father; for the young gentleman, according to Fates and
Destinies
    and such odd sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of
    learning, is indeed deceased; or, as you would say in plain
    terms, gone to heaven.
GOBBO.
Marry, God forbid!
The boy was the very staff of my age,
my
    very prop.
LAUNCELOT.
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or
a
    prop?
Do you know me, father?
GOBBO.
Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman; but I
pray
    you tell me, is my boy- God rest his soul!- alive or dead?
LAUNCELOT.
Do you not know me, father?
GOBBO.
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
LAUNCELOT.
Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of
the
    knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his own child.
Well,
    old man, I will tell you news of your son.
Give me your
blessing;
    truth will come to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's
son
    may, but in the end truth will out.
GOBBO.
Pray you, sir, stand up; I am sure you are not Launcelot
my
    boy.
LAUNCELOT.
Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but
give
    me your blessing; I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son
    that is, your child that shall be.
GOBBO.
I cannot think you are my son.
LAUNCELOT.
I know not what I shall think of that; but I am
    Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your wife is
my
    mother.
GOBBO.
Her name is Margery, indeed.
I'll be sworn, if thou be
    Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.
Lord worshipp'd
    might he be, what a beard hast thou got!
Thou hast got more
hair
    on thy chin than Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.
LAUNCELOT.
It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows
backward;
    I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face
    when I last saw him.
GOBBO.
Lord, how art thou chang'd!
How dost thou and thy master
    agree?
I have brought him a present.
How 'gree you now?
LAUNCELOT.
Well, well; but, for mine own part, as I have set up
my
    rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some
ground.
My master's a very Jew.
Give him a present!
Give him a
halter.
I
    am famish'd in his service; you may tell every finger I have
with
    my ribs.
Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present
to
    one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries; if I
    serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground.
O
rare
    fortune!
Here comes the man.
To him, father, for I am a Jew,
if I
    serve the Jew any longer.
Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO, with a FOLLOWER or two
  BASSANIO.
You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper be


    ready at the farthest by five of the clock.
See these letters


    delivered, put the liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to


    come anon to my lodging.
Exit a SERVANT


  LAUNCELOT.
To him, father.
GOBBO.
God bless your worship!
BASSANIO.
Gramercy; wouldst thou aught with me?
GOBBO.
Here's my son, sir, a poor boy-


  LAUNCELOT.
Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man, that


would,


    sir, as my father shall specify-


  GOBBO.
He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to


serve-


  LAUNCELOT.
Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,


and


    have a desire, as my father shall specify-


  GOBBO.
His master and he, saving your worship's reverence, are


    scarce cater-cousins-


  LAUNCELOT.
To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having


done


    me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being I hope an old


man,


    shall frutify unto you-


  GOBBO.
I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon


your


    worship; and my suit is-


  LAUNCELOT.
In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as


    your worship shall know by this honest old man; and, though I


say


    it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.
BASSANIO.
One speak for both.
What would you?
LAUNCELOT.
Serve you, sir.
GOBBO.
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
BASSANIO.
I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit.
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,


    And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment


    To leave a rich Jew's service to become


    The follower of so poor a gentleman.
LAUNCELOT.
The old proverb is very well parted between my


master


    Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of God, sir, and he


hath


    enough.
BASSANIO.
Thou speak'st it well.
Go, father, with thy son.
Take leave of thy old master, and inquire


    My lodging out.
[To a SERVANT]  Give him a livery


    More guarded than his fellows'; see it done.
LAUNCELOT.
Father, in.
I cannot get a service, no!
I have ne'er


a


    tongue in my head!
[Looking on his palm]  Well; if any man


in


    Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a


book- I


    shall have good fortune.
Go to, here's a simple line of life;


    here's a small trifle of wives; alas, fifteen wives is


nothing;


    a'leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one


man.
And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my


life


    with the edge of a feather-bed-here are simple scapes.
Well,


if


    Fortune be a woman, she's a good wench for this gear.
Father,


    come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling.
Exeunt LAUNCELOT and OLD GOBBO


  BASSANIO.
I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.
These things being bought and orderly bestowed,


    Return in haste, for I do feast to-night


    My best esteem'd acquaintance; hie thee, go.
LEONARDO.
My best endeavours shall be done herein.
Enter GRATIANO
  GRATIANO.
Where's your master?
LEONARDO.
Yonder, sir, he walks.
Exit


  GRATIANO.
Signior Bassanio!
BASSANIO.
Gratiano!
GRATIANO.
I have suit to you.
BASSANIO.
You have obtain'd it.
GRATIANO.
You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
BASSANIO.
Why, then you must.
But hear thee, Gratiano:


    Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice-


    Parts that become thee happily enough,


    And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;


    But where thou art not known, why there they show


    Something too liberal.
Pray thee, take pain


    To allay with some cold drops of modesty


    Thy skipping spirit; lest through thy wild behaviour


    I be misconst'red in the place I go to


    And lose my hopes.
GRATIANO.
Signior Bassanio, hear me:


    If I do not put on a sober habit,


    Talk with respect, and swear but now and then,


    Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,


    Nay more, while grace is saying hood mine eyes


    Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say amen,


    Use all the observance of civility


    Like one well studied in a sad ostent


    To please his grandam, never trust me more.
BASSANIO.
Well, we shall see your bearing.
GRATIANO.
Nay, but I bar to-night; you shall not gauge me


    By what we do to-night.
BASSANIO.
No, that were pity;


    I would entreat you rather to put on


    Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends


    That purpose merriment.
But fare you well;


    I have some business.
GRATIANO.
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest;


    But we will visit you at supper-time.
Exeunt


Enter JESSICA and LAUNCELOT
  JESSICA.
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
Our house is hell; and thou, a merry devil,


    Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
But fare thee well; there is a ducat for thee;


    And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see


    Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest.
Give him this letter; do it secretly.
And so farewell.
I would not have my father


    See me in talk with thee.
LAUNCELOT.
Adieu!
tears exhibit my tongue.
Most beautiful


pagan,


    most sweet Jew!
If a Christian do not play the knave and get


    thee, I am much deceived.
But, adieu!
these foolish drops do


    something drown my manly spirit; adieu!
JESSICA.
Farewell, good Launcelot.
Exit LAUNCELOT


    Alack, what heinous sin is it in me


    To be asham'd to be my father's child!
But though I am a daughter to his blood,


    I am not to his manners.
O Lorenzo,


    If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,


    Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
Exit


Enter GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALERIO, and SOLANIO
  LORENZO.
Nay, we will slink away in suppertime,


    Disguise us at my lodging, and return


    All in an hour.
GRATIANO.
We have not made good preparation.
SALERIO.
We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.
SOLANIO.
'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered;


    And better in my mind not undertook.
LORENZO.
'Tis now but four o'clock; we have two hours


    To furnish us.
Enter LAUNCELOT, With a letter
    Friend Launcelot, what's the news?
LAUNCELOT.
An it shall please you to break up this, it shall


seem


    to signify.
LORENZO.
I know the hand; in faith, 'tis a fair hand,


    And whiter than the paper it writ on


    Is the fair hand that writ.
GRATIANO.
Love-news, in faith!
LAUNCELOT.
By your leave, sir.
LORENZO.
Whither goest thou?
LAUNCELOT.
Marry, sir, to bid my old master, the Jew, to sup


    to-night with my new master, the Christian.
LORENZO.
Hold, here, take this.
Tell gentle Jessica


    I will not fail her; speak it privately.
Go, gentlemen,                                Exit LAUNCELOT


    Will you prepare you for this masque to-night?
I am provided of a torch-bearer.
SALERIO.
Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
SOLANIO.
And so will I.


  LORENZO.
Meet me and Gratiano


    At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.
SALERIO.
'Tis good we do so.
Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO


  GRATIANO.
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
LORENZO.
I must needs tell thee all.
She hath directed


    How I shall take her from her father's house;


    What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with;


    What page's suit she hath in readiness.
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,


    It will be for his gentle daughter's sake;


    And never dare misfortune cross her foot,


    Unless she do it under this excuse,


    That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
Come, go with me, peruse this as thou goest;


    Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.
Exeunt


Enter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT
  SHYLOCK.
Well, thou shalt see; thy eyes shall be thy judge,


    The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.-


    What, Jessica!- Thou shalt not gormandize


    As thou hast done with me- What, Jessica!-


    And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out-


    Why, Jessica, I say!
LAUNCELOT.
Why, Jessica!
SHYLOCK.
Who bids thee call?
I do not bid thee call.
LAUNCELOT.
Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing


    without bidding.
Enter JESSICA
  JESSICA.
Call you?
What is your will?
SHYLOCK.
I am bid forth to supper, Jessica;


    There are my keys.
But wherefore should I go?
I am not bid for love; they flatter me;


    But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon


    The prodigal Christian.
Jessica, my girl,


    Look to my house.
I am right loath to go;


    There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,


    For I did dream of money-bags to-night.
LAUNCELOT.
I beseech you, sir, go; my young master doth expect


your


    reproach.
SHYLOCK.
So do I his.
LAUNCELOT.
And they have conspired together; I will not say you


    shall see a masque, but if you do, then it was not for


nothing


    that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six


o'clock


    i' th' morning, falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was


four


    year, in th' afternoon.
SHYLOCK.
What, are there masques?
Hear you me, Jessica:


    Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum,


    And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,


    Clamber not you up to the casements then,


    Nor thrust your head into the public street


    To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces;


    But stop my house's ears- I mean my casements;


    Let not the sound of shallow fopp'ry enter


    My sober house.
By Jacob's staff, I swear


    I have no mind of feasting forth to-night;


    But I will go.
Go you before me, sirrah;


    Say I will come.
LAUNCELOT.
I will go before, sir.
Mistress, look out at window


for


    all this.
There will come a Christian by


        Will be worth a Jewess' eye.
Exit


  SHYLOCK.
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
JESSICA.
His words were 'Farewell, mistress'; nothing else.
SHYLOCK.
The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,


    Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day


    More than the wild-cat; drones hive not with me,


    Therefore I part with him; and part with him


    To one that I would have him help to waste


    His borrowed purse.
Well, Jessica, go in;


    Perhaps I will return immediately.
Do as I bid you, shut doors after you.
Fast bind, fast find-


    A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
Exit


  JESSICA.
Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,


    I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
Exit


Enter the maskers, GRATIANO and SALERIO
  GRATIANO.
This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo


    Desired us to make stand.
SALERIO.
His hour is almost past.
GRATIANO.
And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,


    For lovers ever run before the clock.
SALERIO.
O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly


    To seal love's bonds new made than they are wont


    To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
GRATIANO.
That ever holds: who riseth from a feast


    With that keen appetite that he sits down?
Where is the horse that doth untread again


    His tedious measures with the unbated fire


    That he did pace them first?
All things that are


    Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed.
How like a younker or a prodigal


    The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,


    Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind;


    How like the prodigal doth she return,


    With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,


    Lean, rent, and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
Enter LORENZO
  SALERIO.
Here comes Lorenzo; more of this hereafter.
LORENZO.
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode!
Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait.
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,


    I'll watch as long for you then.
Approach;


    Here dwells my father Jew.
Ho!
who's within?
Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes
  JESSICA.
Who are you?
Tell me, for more certainty,


    Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
LORENZO.
Lorenzo, and thy love.
JESSICA.
Lorenzo, certain; and my love indeed;


    For who love I so much?
And now who knows


    But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
LORENZO.
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
JESSICA.
Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,


    For I am much asham'd of my exchange;


    But love is blind, and lovers cannot see


    The pretty follies that themselves commit,


    For, if they could, Cupid himself would blush


    To see me thus transformed to a boy.
LORENZO.
Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.
JESSICA.
What!
must I hold a candle to my shames?
They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light.
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love,


    And I should be obscur'd.
LORENZO.
So are you, sweet,


    Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
But come at once,


    For the close night doth play the runaway,


    And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.
JESSICA.
I will make fast the doors, and gild myself


    With some moe ducats, and be with you straight.
Exit above


  GRATIANO.
Now, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew.
LORENZO.
Beshrew me, but I love her heartily,


    For she is wise, if I can judge of her,


    And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,


    And true she is, as she hath prov'd herself;


    And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true,


    Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
Enter JESSICA, below
    What, art thou come?
On, gentlemen, away;


    Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
Exit with JESSICA and SALERIO


                        Enter ANTONIO
  ANTONIO.
Who's there?
GRATIANO.
Signior Antonio?
ANTONIO.
Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?
'Tis nine o'clock; our friends all stay for you;


    No masque to-night; the wind is come about;


    Bassanio presently will go aboard;


    I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
GRATIANO.
I am glad on't; I desire no more delight


    Than to be under sail and gone to-night.
Exeunt


Flourish of cornets.
Enter PORTIA, with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO,
and their trains
  PORTIA.
Go draw aside the curtains and discover


    The several caskets to this noble Prince.
Now make your choice.
PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
The first, of gold, who this inscription


bears:


    'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
The second, silver, which this promise carries:


    'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt:


    'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
How shall I know if I do choose the right?
PORTIA.
The one of them contains my picture, Prince;


    If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
Some god direct my judgment!
Let me see;


    I will survey th' inscriptions back again.
What says this leaden casket?
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
Must give- for what?
For lead?
Hazard for lead!
This casket threatens; men that hazard all


    Do it in hope of fair advantages.
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;


    I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
What says the silver with her virgin hue?
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
As much as he deserves!
Pause there, Morocco,


    And weigh thy value with an even hand.
If thou beest rated by thy estimation,


    Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough


    May not extend so far as to the lady;


    And yet to be afeard of my deserving


    Were but a weak disabling of myself.
As much as I deserve?
Why, that's the lady!
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,


    In graces, and in qualities of breeding;


    But more than these, in love I do deserve.
What if I stray'd no farther, but chose here?
Let's see once more this saying grav'd in gold:


    'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
Why, that's the lady!
All the world desires her;


    From the four corners of the earth they come


    To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint.
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds


    Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now


    For princes to come view fair Portia.
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head


    Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar


    To stop the foreign spirits, but they come


    As o'er a brook to see fair Portia.
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
Is't like that lead contains her?
'Twere damnation


    To think so base a thought; it were too gross


    To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
Or shall I think in silver she's immur'd,


    Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
O sinful thought!
Never so rich a gem


    Was set in worse than gold.
They have in England


    A coin that bears the figure of an angel


    Stamp'd in gold; but that's insculp'd upon.
But here an angel in a golden bed


    Lies all within.
Deliver me the key;


    Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!
PORTIA.
There, take it, Prince, and if my form lie there,


    Then I am yours.
[He opens the golden casket]


  PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
O hell!
what have we here?
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye


    There is a written scroll!
I'll read the writing.
'All that glisters is not gold,


         Often have you heard that told;


         Many a man his life hath sold


         But my outside to behold.
Gilded tombs do worms infold.
Had you been as wise as bold,


         Young in limbs, in judgment old,


         Your answer had not been inscroll'd.
Fare you well, your suit is cold.'
Cold indeed, and labour lost,


      Then farewell, heat, and welcome, frost.
Portia, adieu!
I have too griev'd a heart


    To take a tedious leave; thus losers part.
Exit with his train.
Flourish of cornets


  PORTIA.
A gentle riddance.
Draw the curtains, go.
Let all of his complexion choose me so.
Exeunt


Enter SALERIO and SOLANIO
  SALERIO.
Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail;


    With him is Gratiano gone along;


    And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
SOLANIO.
The villain Jew with outcries rais'd the Duke,


    Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.
SALERIO.
He came too late, the ship was under sail;


    But there the Duke was given to understand


    That in a gondola were seen together


    Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica;


    Besides, Antonio certified the Duke


    They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
SOLANIO.
I never heard a passion so confus'd,


    So strange, outrageous, and so variable,


    As the dog Jew did utter in the streets.
'My daughter!
O my ducats!
O my daughter!
Fled with a Christian!
O my Christian ducats!
Justice!
the law!
My ducats and my daughter!
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,


    Of double ducats, stol'n from me by my daughter!
And jewels- two stones, two rich and precious stones,


    Stol'n by my daughter!
Justice!
Find the girl;


    She hath the stones upon her and the ducats.'
SALERIO.
Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,


    Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.
SOLANIO.
Let good Antonio look he keep his day,


    Or he shall pay for this.
SALERIO.
Marry, well rememb'red;


    I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,


    Who told me, in the narrow seas that part


    The French and English, there miscarried


    A vessel of our country richly fraught.
I thought upon Antonio when he told me,


    And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
SOLANIO.
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;


    Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
SALERIO.
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part.
Bassanio told him he would make some speed


    Of his return.
He answered 'Do not so;


    Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,


    But stay the very riping of the time;


    And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,


    Let it not enter in your mind of love;


    Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts


    To courtship, and such fair ostents of love


    As shall conveniently become you there.'
And even there, his eye being big with tears,


    Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,


    And with affection wondrous sensible


    He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.
SOLANIO.
I think he only loves the world for him.
I pray thee, let us go and find him out,


    And quicken his embraced heaviness


    With some delight or other.
SALERIO.
Do we so.
Exeunt


Enter NERISSA, and a SERVITOR
  NERISSA.
Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight;


    The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,


    And comes to his election presently.
Flourish of cornets.
Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON,


                    PORTIA, and their trains


  PORTIA.
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince.
If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,


    Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz'd;


    But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,


    You must be gone from hence immediately.
ARRAGON.
I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:


    First, never to unfold to any one


    Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail


    Of the right casket, never in my life


    To woo a maid in way of marriage;


    Lastly,


    If I do fail in fortune of my choice,


    Immediately to leave you and be gone.
PORTIA.
To these injunctions every one doth swear


    That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
ARRAGON.
And so have I address'd me.
Fortune now


    To my heart's hope!
Gold, silver, and base lead.
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.
What says the golden chest?
Ha!
let me see:


    'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
What many men desire- that 'many' may be meant


    By the fool multitude, that choose by show,


    Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;


    Which pries not to th' interior, but, like the martlet,


    Builds in the weather on the outward wall,


    Even in the force and road of casualty.
I will not choose what many men desire,


    Because I will not jump with common spirits


    And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house!
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear.
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
And well said too; for who shall go about


    To cozen fortune, and be honourable


    Without the stamp of merit?
Let none presume


    To wear an undeserved dignity.
O that estates, degrees, and offices,


    Were not deriv'd corruptly, and that clear honour


    Were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer!
How many then should cover that stand bare!
How many be commanded that command!
How much low peasantry would then be gleaned


    From the true seed of honour!
and how much honour


    Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times,


    To be new varnish'd!
Well, but to my choice.
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
I will assume desert.
Give me a key for this,


    And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
[He opens the silver casket]


  PORTIA.
[Aside]  Too long a pause for that which you find


there.
ARRAGON.
What's here?
The portrait of a blinking idiot


    Presenting me a schedule!
I will read it.
How much unlike art thou to Portia!
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
Is that my prize?
Are my deserts no better?
PORTIA.
To offend and judge are distinct offices


    And of opposed natures.
ARRAGON.
What is here?
[Reads]


         'The fire seven times tried this;


         Seven times tried that judgment is


         That did never choose amiss.
Some there be that shadows kiss,


         Such have but a shadow's bliss.
There be fools alive iwis


         Silver'd o'er, and so was this.
Take what wife you will to bed,


         I will ever be your head.
So be gone; you are sped.'
'till more fool I shall appear


         By the time I linger here.
With one fool's head I came to woo,


         But I go away with two.
Sweet, adieu!
I'll keep my oath,


         Patiently to bear my wroth.
Exit with his train


  PORTIA.
Thus hath the candle sing'd the moth.
O, these deliberate fools!
When they do choose,


    They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
NERISSA.
The ancient saying is no heresy:


    Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.
PORTIA.
Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
Enter a SERVANT
  SERVANT.
Where is my lady?
PORTIA.
Here; what would my lord?
SERVANT.
Madam, there is alighted at your gate


    A young Venetian, one that comes before


    To signify th' approaching of his lord,


    From whom he bringeth sensible regreets;


    To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,


    Gifts of rich value.
Yet I have not seen


    So likely an ambassador of love.
A day in April never came so sweet


    To show how costly summer was at hand


    As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
PORTIA.
No more, I pray thee; I am half afeard


    Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,


    Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to see


    Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.
NERISSA.
Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!
Exeunt

Enter SOLANIO and SALERIO
  SOLANIO.
Now, what news on the Rialto?
SALERIO.
Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath a


ship


    of rich lading wreck'd on the narrow seas; the Goodwins I


think


    they call the place, a very dangerous flat and fatal, where


the


    carcases of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my


    gossip Report be an honest woman of her word.
SOLANIO.
I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever


knapp'd


    ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death


of a


    third husband.
But it is true, without any slips of prolixity


or


    crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio,


the


    honest Antonio- O that I had a title good enough to keep his


name


    company!-


  SALERIO.
Come, the full stop.
SOLANIO.
Ha!
What sayest thou?
Why, the end is, he hath lost a


    ship.
SALERIO.
I would it might prove the end of his losses.
SOLANIO.
Let me say amen betimes, lest the devil cross my


prayer,


    for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
Enter SHYLOCK
    How now, Shylock?
What news among the merchants?
SHYLOCK.
You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my


    daughter's flight.
SALERIO.
That's certain; I, for my part, knew the tailor that


made


    the wings she flew withal.
SOLANIO.
And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was


flidge;


    and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.
SHYLOCK.
She is damn'd for it.
SALERIO.
That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
SHYLOCK.
My own flesh and blood to rebel!
SOLANIO.
Out upon it, old carrion!
Rebels it at these years?
SHYLOCK.
I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.
SALERIO.
There is more difference between thy flesh and hers


than


    between jet and ivory; more between your bloods than there is


    between red wine and Rhenish.
But tell us, do you hear


whether


    Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?
SHYLOCK.
There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a


prodigal,


    who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto; a beggar, that


was


    us'd to come so smug upon the mart.
Let him look to his bond.
He


    was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond.
He was


wont


    to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him look to his


bond.
SALERIO.
Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his


    flesh.
What's that good for?
SHYLOCK.
To bait fish withal.
If it will feed nothing else, it


will


    feed my revenge.
He hath disgrac'd me and hind'red me half a


    million; laugh'd at my losses, mock'd at my gains, scorned my


    nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine


    enemies.
And what's his reason?
I am a Jew.
Hath not a Jew


eyes?
Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections,


    passions, fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,


    subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means,


warmed


    and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is?
If


    you prick us, do we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not


laugh?
If you poison us, do we not die?
And if you wrong us, shall


we


    not revenge?
If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble


you


    in that.
If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?
Revenge.
If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his


sufferance


    be by Christian example?
Why, revenge.
The villainy you teach


me


    I will execute; and itshall go hard but I will better the


    instruction.
Enter a MAN from ANTONIO
  MAN.
Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires


to


    speak with you both.
SALERIO.
We have been up and down to seek him.
Enter TUBAL
  SOLANIO.
Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be


    match'd, unless the devil himself turn Jew.
Exeunt SOLANIO, SALERIO, and MAN


  SHYLOCK.
How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa?
Hast thou found


my


    daughter?
TUBAL.
I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find


her.
SHYLOCK.
Why there, there, there, there!
A diamond gone, cost


me


    two thousand ducats in Frankfort!
The curse never fell upon


our


    nation till now; I never felt it till now.
Two thousand


ducats in


    that, and other precious, precious jewels.
I would my


daughter


    were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; would she


were


    hears'd at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin!
No news of


    them?
Why, so- and I know not what's spent in the search.
Why,


    thou- loss upon loss!
The thief gone with so much, and so


much to


    find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge; nor no ill


luck


    stirring but what lights o' my shoulders; no sighs but o' my


    breathing; no tears but o' my shedding!
TUBAL.
Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I heard in


    Genoa-


  SHYLOCK.
What, what, what?
Ill luck, ill luck?
TUBAL.
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
SHYLOCK.
I thank God, I thank God.
Is it true, is it true?
TUBAL.
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
SHYLOCK.
I thank thee, good Tubal.
Good news, good news- ha,


ha!-


    heard in Genoa.
TUBAL.
Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night,


    fourscore ducats.
SHYLOCK.
Thou stick'st a dagger in me- I shall never see my


gold


    again.
Fourscore ducats at a sitting!
Fourscore ducats!
TUBAL.
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company


to


    Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.
SHYLOCK.
I am very glad of it; I'll plague him, I'll torture


him; I


    am glad of it.
TUBAL.
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your


daughter


    for a monkey.
SHYLOCK.
Out upon her!
Thou torturest me, Tubal.
It was my


    turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor; I would


not


    have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
TUBAL.
But Antonio is certainly undone.
SHYLOCK.
Nay, that's true; that's very true.
Go, Tubal, fee me


an


    officer; bespeak him a fortnight before.
I will have the


heart of


    him, if he forfeit; for, were he out of Venice, I can make


what


    merchandise I will.
Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;


go,


    good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.
Exeunt


Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and all their trains
  PORTIA.
I pray you tarry; pause a day or two


    Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,


    I lose your company; therefore forbear a while.
There's something tells me- but it is not love-


    I would not lose you; and you know yourself


    Hate counsels not in such a quality.
But lest you should not understand me well-


    And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought-


    I would detain you here some month or two


    Before you venture for me.
I could teach you


    How to choose right, but then I am forsworn;


    So will I never be; so may you miss me;


    But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,


    That I had been forsworn.
Beshrew your eyes!
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;


    One half of me is yours, the other half yours-


    Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,


    And so all yours.
O!
these naughty times


    Puts bars between the owners and their rights;


    And so, though yours, not yours.
Prove it so,


    Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.


    I speak too long, but 'tis to peize the time,


    To eke it, and to draw it out in length,


    To stay you from election.
BASSANIO.
Let me choose;


    For as I am, I live upon the rack.
PORTIA.
Upon the rack, Bassanio?
Then confess


    What treason there is mingled with your love.
BASSANIO.
None but that ugly treason of mistrust


    Which makes me fear th' enjoying of my love;


    There may as well be amity and life


    'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.
PORTIA.
Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,


    Where men enforced do speak anything.
BASSANIO.
Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
PORTIA.
Well then, confess and live.
BASSANIO.
'Confess' and 'love'


    Had been the very sum of my confession.
O happy torment, when my torturer


    Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
PORTIA.
Away, then; I am lock'd in one of them.
If you do love me, you will find me out.
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof;


    Let music sound while he doth make his choice;


    Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,


    Fading in music.
That the comparison


    May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream


    And wat'ry death-bed for him.
He may win;


    And what is music then?
Then music is


    Even as the flourish when true subjects bow


    To a new-crowned monarch; such it is


    As are those dulcet sounds in break of day


    That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear


    And summon him to marriage.
Now he goes,


    With no less presence, but with much more love,


    Than young Alcides when he did redeem


    The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy


    To the sea-monster.
I stand for sacrifice;


    The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,


    With bleared visages come forth to view


    The issue of th' exploit.
Go, Hercules!
Live thou, I live.
With much much more dismay


    I view the fight than thou that mak'st the fray.
the whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself
                 Tell me where is fancy bred,


                 Or in the heart or in the head,


                 How begot, how nourished?
Reply, reply.
It is engend'red in the eyes,


                 With gazing fed; and fancy dies


                 In the cradle where it lies.
Let us all ring fancy's knell:


                   I'll begin it- Ding, dong, bell.
ALL.
Ding, dong, bell.
BASSANIO.
So may the outward shows be least themselves;


    The world is still deceiv'd with ornament.
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt


    But, being season'd with a gracious voice,


    Obscures the show of evil?
In religion,


    What damned error but some sober brow


    Will bless it, and approve it with a text,


    Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
There is no vice so simple but assumes


    Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false


    As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins


    The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;


    Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk!
And these assume but valour's excrement


    To render them redoubted.
Look on beauty


    And you shall see 'tis purchas'd by the weight,


    Which therein works a miracle in nature,


    Making them lightest that wear most of it;


    So are those crisped snaky golden locks


    Which make such wanton gambols with the wind


    Upon supposed fairness often known


    To be the dowry of a second head-


    The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore


    To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf


    Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,


    The seeming truth which cunning times put on


    To entrap the wisest.
Therefore, thou gaudy gold,


    Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;


    Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge


    'Tween man and man; but thou, thou meagre lead,


    Which rather threaten'st than dost promise aught,


    Thy plainness moves me more than eloquence,


    And here choose I. Joy be the consequence!
PORTIA.
[Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air,


    As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac'd despair,


    And shudd'ring fear, and green-ey'd jealousy!
O love, be moderate, allay thy ecstasy,


    In measure rain thy joy, scant this excess!
I feel too much thy blessing.
Make it less,


    For fear I surfeit.
BASSANIO.
[Opening the leaden casket]  What find I here?
Fair Portia's counterfeit!
What demi-god


    Hath come so near creation?
Move these eyes?
Or whether riding on the balls of mine


    Seem they in motion?
Here are sever'd lips,


    Parted with sugar breath; so sweet a bar


    Should sunder such sweet friends.
Here in her hairs


    The painter plays the spider, and hath woven


    A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men


    Faster than gnats in cobwebs.
But her eyes-


    How could he see to do them?
Having made one,


    Methinks it should have power to steal both his,


    And leave itself unfurnish'd.
Yet look how far


    The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow


    In underprizing it, so far this shadow


    Doth limp behind the substance.
Here's the scroll,


    The continent and summary of my fortune.
'You that choose not by the view,


         Chance as fair and choose as true!
Since this fortune falls to you,


         Be content and seek no new.
If you be well pleas'd with this,


         And hold your fortune for your bliss,


         Turn to where your lady is


         And claim her with a loving kiss.'
A gentle scroll.
Fair lady, by your leave;


    I come by note, to give and to receive.
Like one of two contending in a prize,


    That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,


    Hearing applause and universal shout,


    Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt


    Whether those peals of praise be his or no;


    So, thrice-fair lady, stand I even so,


    As doubtful whether what I see be true,


    Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.
PORTIA.
You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,


    Such as I am.
Though for myself alone


    I would not be ambitious in my wish


    To wish myself much better, yet for you


    I would be trebled twenty times myself,


    A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,


    That only to stand high in your account


    I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,


    Exceed account.
But the full sum of me


    Is sum of something which, to term in gross,


    Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractis'd;


    Happy in this, she is not yet so old


    But she may learn; happier than this,


    She is not bred so dull but she can learn;


    Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit


    Commits itself to yours to be directed,


    As from her lord, her governor, her king.
Myself and what is mine to you and yours


    Is now converted.
But now I was the lord


    Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,


    Queen o'er myself; and even now, but now,


    This house, these servants, and this same myself,


    Are yours- my lord's.
I give them with this ring,


    Which when you part from, lose, or give away,


    Let it presage the ruin of your love,


    And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
BASSANIO.
Madam, you have bereft me of all words;


    Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;


    And there is such confusion in my powers


    As, after some oration fairly spoke


    By a beloved prince, there doth appear


    Among the buzzing pleased multitude,


    Where every something, being blent together,


    Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy


    Express'd and not express'd.
But when this ring


    Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence;


    O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!
NERISSA.
My lord and lady, it is now our time


    That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper


    To cry 'Good joy.'
Good joy, my lord and lady!
GRATIANO.
My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,


    I wish you all the joy that you can wish,


    For I am sure you can wish none from me;


    And, when your honours mean to solemnize


    The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you


    Even at that time I may be married too.
BASSANIO.
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
GRATIANO.
I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:


    You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;


    You lov'd, I lov'd; for intermission


    No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
Your fortune stood upon the caskets there,


    And so did mine too, as the matter falls;


    For wooing here until I sweat again,


    And swearing till my very roof was dry


    With oaths of love, at last- if promise last-


    I got a promise of this fair one here


    To have her love, provided that your fortune


    Achiev'd her mistress.
PORTIA.
Is this true, Nerissa?
NERISSA.
Madam, it is, so you stand pleas'd withal.
BASSANIO.
And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
GRATIANO.
Yes, faith, my lord.
BASSANIO.
Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.
GRATIANO.
We'll play with them: the first boy for a thousand


    ducats.
NERISSA.
What, and stake down?
GRATIANO.
No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down-


    But who comes here?
Lorenzo and his infidel?
What, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio!
Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a messenger


                           from Venice


  BASSANIO.
Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,


    If that the youth of my new int'rest here


    Have power to bid you welcome.
By your leave,


    I bid my very friends and countrymen,


    Sweet Portia, welcome.
PORTIA.
So do I, my lord;


    They are entirely welcome.
LORENZO.
I thank your honour.
For my part, my lord,


    My purpose was not to have seen you here;


    But meeting with Salerio by the way,


    He did entreat me, past all saying nay,


    To come with him along.
SALERIO.
I did, my lord,


    And I have reason for it.
Signior Antonio


    Commends him to you.
[Gives BASSANIO a letter]


  BASSANIO.
Ere I ope his letter,


    I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.
SALERIO.
Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;


    Nor well, unless in mind; his letter there


    Will show you his estate.
[BASSANIO opens the letter]


  GRATIANO.
Nerissa, cheer yond stranger; bid her welcome.
Your hand, Salerio.
What's the news from Venice?
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
I know he will be glad of our success:


    We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
SALERIO.
I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
PORTIA.
There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper


    That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:


    Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world


    Could turn so much the constitution


    Of any constant man.
What, worse and worse!
With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,


    And I must freely have the half of anything


    That this same paper brings you.
BASSANIO.
O sweet Portia,


    Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words


    That ever blotted paper!
Gentle lady,


    When I did first impart my love to you,


    I freely told you all the wealth I had


    Ran in my veins- I was a gentleman;


    And then I told you true.
And yet, dear lady,


    Rating myself at nothing, you shall see


    How much I was a braggart.
When I told you


    My state was nothing, I should then have told you


    That I was worse than nothing; for indeed


    I have engag'd myself to a dear friend,


    Engag'd my friend to his mere enemy,


    To feed my means.
Here is a letter, lady,


    The paper as the body of my friend,


    And every word in it a gaping wound


    Issuing life-blood.
But is it true, Salerio?
Hath all his ventures fail'd?
What, not one hit?
From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,


    From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,


    And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch


    Of merchant-marring rocks?
SALERIO.
Not one, my lord.
Besides, it should appear that, if he had


    The present money to discharge the Jew,


    He would not take it.
Never did I know


    A creature that did bear the shape of man


    So keen and greedy to confound a man.
He plies the Duke at morning and at night,


    And doth impeach the freedom of the state,


    If they deny him justice.
Twenty merchants,


    The Duke himself, and the magnificoes


    Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;


    But none can drive him from the envious plea


    Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.
JESSICA.
When I was with him, I have heard him swear


    To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,


    That he would rather have Antonio's flesh


    Than twenty times the value of the sum


    That he did owe him; and I know, my lord,


    If law, authority, and power, deny not,


    It will go hard with poor Antonio.
PORTIA.
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
BASSANIO.
The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,


    The best condition'd and unwearied spirit


    In doing courtesies; and one in whom


    The ancient Roman honour more appears


    Than any that draws breath in Italy.
PORTIA.
What sum owes he the Jew?
BASSANIO.
For me, three thousand ducats.
PORTIA.
What!
no more?
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;


    Double six thousand, and then treble that,


    Before a friend of this description


    Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
First go with me to church and call me wife,


    And then away to Venice to your friend;


    For never shall you lie by Portia's side


    With an unquiet soul.
You shall have gold


    To pay the petty debt twenty times over.
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime


    Will live as maids and widows.
Come, away;


    For you shall hence upon your wedding day.
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer;


    Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
But let me hear the letter of your friend.
BASSANIO.
[Reads]  'Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all


miscarried,


    my creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to


the


    Jew is forfeit; and since, in paying it, it is impossible I


    should live, all debts are clear'd between you and I, if I


might


    but see you at my death.
Notwithstanding, use your pleasure;


if


    your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.'
PORTIA.
O love, dispatch all business and be gone!
BASSANIO.
Since I have your good leave to go away,


    I will make haste; but, till I come again,


    No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,


    Nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.
Exeunt


Enter SHYLOCK, SOLANIO, ANTONIO, and GAOLER
  SHYLOCK.
Gaoler, look to him.
Tell not me of mercy-


    This is the fool that lent out money gratis.
Gaoler, look to him.
ANTONIO.
Hear me yet, good Shylock.
SHYLOCK.
I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond.
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,


    But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs;


    The Duke shall grant me justice.
I do wonder,


    Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond


    To come abroad with him at his request.
ANTONIO.
I pray thee hear me speak.
SHYLOCK.
I'll have my bond.
I will not hear thee speak;


    I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
I'll not be made a soft and dull-ey'd fool,


    To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield,


    To Christian intercessors.
Follow not;


    I'll have no speaking; I will have my bond.
Exit


  SOLANIO.
It is the most impenetrable cur


    That ever kept with men.
ANTONIO.
Let him alone;


    I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
He seeks my life; his reason well I know:


    I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures


    Many that have at times made moan to me;


    Therefore he hates me.
SOLANIO.
I am sure the Duke


    Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
ANTONIO.
The Duke cannot deny the course of law;


    For the commodity that strangers have


    With us in Venice, if it be denied,


    Will much impeach the justice of the state,


    Since that the trade and profit of the city


    Consisteth of all nations.
Therefore, go;


    These griefs and losses have so bated me


    That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh


    To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
Well, gaoler, on; pray God Bassanio come


    To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.
Exeunt


Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and BALTHASAR
  LORENZO.
Madam, although I speak it in your presence,


    You have a noble and a true conceit


    Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly


    In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
But if you knew to whom you show this honour,


    How true a gentleman you send relief,


    How dear a lover of my lord your husband,


    I know you would be prouder of the work


    Than customary bounty can enforce you.
PORTIA.
I never did repent for doing good,


    Nor shall not now; for in companions


    That do converse and waste the time together,


    Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,


    There must be needs a like proportion


    Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit,


    Which makes me think that this Antonio,


    Being the bosom lover of my lord,


    Must needs be like my lord.
If it be so,


    How little is the cost I have bestowed


    In purchasing the semblance of my soul


    From out the state of hellish cruelty!
This comes too near the praising of myself;


    Therefore, no more of it; hear other things.
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands


    The husbandry and manage of my house


    Until my lord's return; for mine own part,


    I have toward heaven breath'd a secret vow


    To live in prayer and contemplation,


    Only attended by Nerissa here,


    Until her husband and my lord's return.
There is a monastery two miles off,


    And there we will abide.
I do desire you


    Not to deny this imposition,


    The which my love and some necessity


    Now lays upon you.
LORENZO.
Madam, with all my heart


    I shall obey you in an fair commands.
PORTIA.
My people do already know my mind,


    And will acknowledge you and Jessica


    In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
So fare you well till we shall meet again.
LORENZO.
Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
JESSICA.
I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
PORTIA.
I thank you for your wish, and am well pleas'd


    To wish it back on you.
Fare you well, Jessica.
Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO


    Now, Balthasar,


    As I have ever found thee honest-true,


    So let me find thee still.
Take this same letter,


    And use thou all th' endeavour of a man


    In speed to Padua; see thou render this


    Into my cousin's hands, Doctor Bellario;


    And look what notes and garments he doth give thee,


    Bring them, I pray thee, with imagin'd speed


    Unto the traject, to the common ferry


    Which trades to Venice.
Waste no time in words,


    But get thee gone; I shall be there before thee.
BALTHASAR.
Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
Exit


  PORTIA.
Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand


    That you yet know not of; we'll see our husbands


    Before they think of us.
NERISSA.
Shall they see us?
PORTIA.
They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit


    That they shall think we are accomplished


    With that we lack.
I'll hold thee any wager,


    When we are both accoutred like young men,


    I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,


    And wear my dagger with the braver grace,


    And speak between the change of man and boy


    With a reed voice; and turn two mincing steps


    Into a manly stride; and speak of frays


    Like a fine bragging youth; and tell quaint lies,


    How honourable ladies sought my love,


    Which I denying, they fell sick and died-


    I could not do withal.
Then I'll repent,


    And wish for all that, that I had not kill'd them.
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,


    That men shall swear I have discontinued school


    About a twelvemonth.
I have within my mind


    A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,


    Which I will practise.
NERISSA.
Why, shall we turn to men?
PORTIA.
Fie, what a question's that,


    If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device


    When I am in my coach, which stays for us


    At the park gate; and therefore haste away,


    For we must measure twenty miles to-day.
Exeunt


Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA
  LAUNCELOT.
Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father


are to


    be laid upon the children; therefore, I promise you, I fear


you.
I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation


of


    the matter; therefore be o' good cheer, for truly I think you


are


    damn'd.
There is but one hope in it that can do you any good,


and


    that is but a kind of bastard hope, neither.
JESSICA.
And what hope is that, I pray thee?
LAUNCELOT.
Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you


not-


   that you are not the Jew's daughter.
JESSICA.
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins


of my


    mother should be visited upon me.
LAUNCELOT.
Truly then I fear you are damn'd both by father and


    mother; thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I fall into


    Charybdis, your mother; well, you are gone both ways.
JESSICA.
I shall be sav'd by my husband; he hath made me a


    Christian.
LAUNCELOT.
Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow


    before, e'en as many as could well live one by another.
This


    making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow


all


    to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the


    coals for money.
Enter LORENZO
  JESSICA.
I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say; here he


    comes.
LORENZO.
I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you


    thus get my wife into corners.
JESSICA.
Nay, you need nor fear us, Lorenzo; Launcelot and I


are


    out; he tells me flatly there's no mercy for me in heaven,


    because I am a Jew's daughter; and he says you are no good


member


    of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you


    raise the price of pork.
LORENZO.
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than


you


    can the getting up of the negro's belly; the Moor is with


child


    by you, Launcelot.
LAUNCELOT.
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason;


but


    if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than


I


    took her for.
LORENZO.
How every fool can play upon the word!
I think the


best


    grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse


grow


    commendable in none only but parrots.
Go in, sirrah; bid them


    prepare for dinner.
LAUNCELOT.
That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
LORENZO.
Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you!
Then bid them


    prepare dinner.
LAUNCELOT.
That is done too, sir, only 'cover' is the word.
LORENZO.
Will you cover, then, sir?
LAUNCELOT.
Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
LORENZO.
Yet more quarrelling with occasion!
Wilt thou show the


    whole wealth of thy wit in an instant?
I pray thee understand


a


    plain man in his plain meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them


cover


    the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.
LAUNCELOT.
For the table, sir, it shall be serv'd in; for the


meat,


    sir, it shall be cover'd; for your coming in to dinner, sir,


why,


    let it be as humours and conceits shall govern.
Exit


  LORENZO.
O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
The fool hath planted in his memory


    An army of good words; and I do know


    A many fools that stand in better place,


    Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word


    Defy the matter.
How cheer'st thou, Jessica?
And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,


    How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?
JESSICA.
Past all expressing.
It is very meet


    The Lord Bassanio live an upright life,


    For, having such a blessing in his lady,


    He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;


    And if on earth he do not merit it,


    In reason he should never come to heaven.
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match,


    And on the wager lay two earthly women,


    And Portia one, there must be something else


    Pawn'd with the other; for the poor rude world


    Hath not her fellow.
LORENZO.
Even such a husband


    Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
JESSICA.
Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
LORENZO.
I will anon; first let us go to dinner.
JESSICA.
Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
LORENZO.
No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;


    Then howsome'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things


    I shall digest it.
JESSICA.
Well, I'll set you forth.
Exeunt


Enter the DUKE, the MAGNIFICOES, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO,
SALERIO,
and OTHERS
  DUKE OF VENICE.
What, is Antonio here?
ANTONIO.
Ready, so please your Grace.
DUKE OF VENICE.
I am sorry for thee; thou art come to answer


    A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,


    Uncapable of pity, void and empty


    From any dram of mercy.
ANTONIO.
I have heard


    Your Grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify


    His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,


    And that no lawful means can carry me


    Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose


    My patience to his fury, and am arm'd


    To suffer with a quietness of spirit


    The very tyranny and rage of his.
DUKE OF VENICE.
Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
SALERIO.
He is ready at the door; he comes, my lord.
Enter SHYLOCK
  DUKE OF VENICE.
Make room, and let him stand before our face.
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,


    That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice


    To the last hour of act; and then, 'tis thought,


    Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse, more strange


    Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;


    And where thou now exacts the penalty,


    Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,


    Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,


    But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,


    Forgive a moiety of the principal,


    Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,


    That have of late so huddled on his back-


    Enow to press a royal merchant down,


    And pluck commiseration of his state


    From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,


    From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd


    To offices of tender courtesy.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
SHYLOCK.
I have possess'd your Grace of what I purpose,


    And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn


    To have the due and forfeit of my bond.
If you deny it, let the danger light


    Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
You'll ask me why I rather choose to have


    A weight of carrion flesh than to receive


    Three thousand ducats.
I'll not answer that,


    But say it is my humour- is it answer'd?
What if my house be troubled with a rat,


    And I be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats


    To have it ban'd?
What, are you answer'd yet?
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;


    Some that are mad if they behold a cat;


    And others, when the bagpipe sings i' th' nose,


    Cannot contain their urine; for affection,


    Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood


    Of what it likes or loathes.
Now, for your answer:


    As there is no firm reason to be rend'red


    Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;


    Why he, a harmless necessary cat;


    Why he, a woollen bagpipe, but of force


    Must yield to such inevitable shame


    As to offend, himself being offended;


    So can I give no reason, nor I will not,


    More than a lodg'd hate and a certain loathing


    I bear Antonio, that I follow thus


    A losing suit against him.
Are you answered?
BASSANIO.
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,


    To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
SHYLOCK.
I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
BASSANIO.
Do all men kill the things they do not love?
SHYLOCK.
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
BASSANIO.
Every offence is not a hate at first.
SHYLOCK.
What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
ANTONIO.
I pray you, think you question with the Jew.
You may as well go stand upon the beach


    And bid the main flood bate his usual height;


    You may as well use question with the wolf,


    Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;


    You may as well forbid the mountain pines


    To wag their high tops and to make no noise


    When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;


    You may as well do anything most hard


    As seek to soften that- than which what's harder?-


    His jewish heart.
Therefore, I do beseech you,


    Make no moe offers, use no farther means,


    But with all brief and plain conveniency


    Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will.
BASSANIO.
For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
SHYLOCK.
If every ducat in six thousand ducats


    Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,


    I would not draw them; I would have my bond.
DUKE OF VENICE.
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend'ring none?
SHYLOCK.
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
You have among you many a purchas'd slave,


    Which, fike your asses and your dogs and mules,


    You use in abject and in slavish parts,


    Because you bought them; shall I say to you


    'Let them be free, marry them to your heirs-


    Why sweat they under burdens?- let their beds


    Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates


    Be season'd with such viands'?
You will answer


    'The slaves are ours.'
So do I answer you:


    The pound of flesh which I demand of him


    Is dearly bought, 'tis mine, and I will have it.
If you deny me, fie upon your law!
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
I stand for judgment; answer; shall I have it?
DUKE OF VENICE.
Upon my power I may dismiss this court,


    Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,


    Whom I have sent for to determine this,


    Come here to-day.
SALERIO.
My lord, here stays without


    A messenger with letters from the doctor,


    New come from Padua.
DUKE OF VENICE.
Bring us the letters; call the messenger.
BASSANIO.
Good cheer, Antonio!
What, man, courage yet!
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,


    Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
ANTONIO.
I am a tainted wether of the flock,


    Meetest for death; the weakest kind of fruit


    Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me.
You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,


    Than to live still, and write mine epitaph.
Enter NERISSA dressed like a lawyer's clerk
  DUKE OF VENICE.
Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
NERISSA.
From both, my lord.
Bellario greets your Grace.
[Presents a letter]


  BASSANIO.
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
SHYLOCK.
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
GRATIANO.
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,


    Thou mak'st thy knife keen; but no metal can,


    No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness


    Of thy sharp envy.
Can no prayers pierce thee?
SHYLOCK.
No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
GRATIANO.
O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
And for thy life let justice be accus'd.
Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith,


    To hold opinion with Pythagoras


    That souls of animals infuse themselves


    Into the trunks of men.
Thy currish spirit


    Govern'd a wolf who, hang'd for human slaughter,


    Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,


    And, whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,


    Infus'd itself in thee; for thy desires


    Are wolfish, bloody, starv'd and ravenous.
SHYLOCK.
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,


    Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud;


    Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall


    To cureless ruin.
I stand here for law.
DUKE OF VENICE.
This letter from Bellario doth commend


    A young and learned doctor to our court.
Where is he?
NERISSA.
He attendeth here hard by


    To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.
DUKE OF VENICE.
With all my heart.
Some three or four of you


    Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario's letter.
CLERK.
[Reads]  'Your Grace shall understand that at the


receipt


    of your letter I am very sick; but in the instant that your


    messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young


doctor


    of Rome—his name is Balthazar.
I acquainted him with the


cause


    in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant; we


    turn'd o'er many books together; he is furnished with my


opinion


    which, bettered with his own learning-the greatness whereof I


    cannot enough commend- comes with him at my importunity to


fill


    up your Grace's request in my stead.
I beseech you let his


lack


    of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend


estimation,


    for I never knew so young a body with so old a head.
I leave


him


    to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better publish


his


    commendation.'
Enter PORTIA for BALTHAZAR, dressed like a Doctor of Laws.
DUKE OF VENICE.
YOU hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes;


    And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
Give me your hand; come you from old Bellario?
PORTIA.
I did, my lord.
DUKE OF VENICE.
You are welcome; take your place.
Are you acquainted with the difference


    That holds this present question in the court?
PORTIA.
I am informed throughly of the cause.
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
DUKE OF VENICE.
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
PORTIA.
Is your name Shylock?
SHYLOCK.
Shylock is my name.
PORTIA.
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;


    Yet in such rule that the Venetian law


    Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
You stand within his danger, do you not?
ANTONIO.
Ay, so he says.
PORTIA.
Do you confess the bond?
ANTONIO.
I do.
PORTIA.
Then must the Jew be merciful.
SHYLOCK.
On what compulsion must I?
Tell me that.
PORTIA.
The quality of mercy is not strain'd;


    It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven


    Upon the place beneath.
It is twice blest:


    It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes


    The throned monarch better than his crown;


    His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,


    The attribute to awe and majesty,


    Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;


    But mercy is above this sceptred sway,


    It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,


    It is an attribute to God himself;


    And earthly power doth then show likest God's


    When mercy seasons justice.
Therefore, Jew,


    Though justice be thy plea, consider this-


    That in the course of justice none of us


    Should see salvation; we do pray for mercy,


    And that same prayer doth teach us all to render


    The deeds of mercy.
I have spoke thus much


    To mitigate the justice of thy plea,


    Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice


    Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
SHYLOCK.
My deeds upon my head!
I crave the law,


    The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
BASSANIO.
Yes; here I tender it for him in the court;


    Yea, twice the sum; if that will not suffice,


    I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er


    On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart;


    If this will not suffice, it must appear


    That malice bears down truth.
And, I beseech you,


    Wrest once the law to your authority;


    To do a great right do a little wrong,


    And curb this cruel devil of his will.
PORTIA.
It must not be; there is no power in Venice


    Can alter a decree established;


    'Twill be recorded for a precedent,


    And many an error, by the same example,


    Will rush into the state; it cannot be.
SHYLOCK.
A Daniel come to judgment!
Yea, a Daniel!
O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!
PORTIA.
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
SHYLOCK.
Here 'tis, most reverend Doctor; here it is.
PORTIA.
Shylock, there's thrice thy money off'red thee.
SHYLOCK.
An oath, an oath!
I have an oath in heaven.
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
No, not for Venice.
PORTIA.
Why, this bond is forfeit;


    And lawfully by this the Jew may claim


    A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off


    Nearest the merchant's heart.
Be merciful.
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
SHYLOCK.
When it is paid according to the tenour.
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;


    You know the law; your exposition


    Hath been most sound; I charge you by the law,


    Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,


    Proceed to judgment.
By my soul I swear


    There is no power in the tongue of man


    To alter me.
I stay here on my bond.
ANTONIO.
Most heartily I do beseech the court


    To give the judgment.
PORTIA.
Why then, thus it is:


    You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
SHYLOCK.
O noble judge!
O excellent young man!
PORTIA.
For the intent and purpose of the law


    Hath full relation to the penalty,


    Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
SHYLOCK.
'Tis very true.
O wise and upright judge,


    How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
PORTIA.
Therefore, lay bare your bosom.
SHYLOCK.
Ay, his breast—


    So says the bond; doth it not, noble judge?
'Nearest his heart,' those are the very words.
PORTIA.
It is so.
Are there balance here to weigh


    The flesh?
SHYLOCK.
I have them ready.
PORTIA.
Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,


    To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
SHYLOCK.
Is it so nominated in the bond?
PORTIA.
It is not so express'd, but what of that?
'Twere good you do so much for charity.
SHYLOCK.
I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
PORTIA.
You, merchant, have you anything to say?
ANTONIO.
But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
Give me your hand, Bassanio; fare you well.
Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you,


    For herein Fortune shows herself more kind


    Than is her custom.
It is still her use


    To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,


    To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow


    An age of poverty; from which ling'ring penance


    Of such misery doth she cut me off.
Commend me to your honourable wife;


    Tell her the process of Antonio's end;


    Say how I lov'd you; speak me fair in death;


    And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge


    Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,


    And he repents not that he pays your debt;


    For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,


    I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.
BASSANIO.
Antonio, I am married to a wife


    Which is as dear to me as life itself;


    But life itself, my wife, and all the world,


    Are not with me esteem'd above thy life;


    I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all


    Here to this devil, to deliver you.
PORTIA.
Your wife would give you little thanks for that,


    If she were by to hear you make the offer.
GRATIANO.
I have a wife who I protest I love;


    I would she were in heaven, so she could


    Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
NERISSA.
'Tis well you offer it behind her back;


    The wish would make else an unquiet house.
SHYLOCK.
[Aside]  These be the Christian husbands!
I have a


    daughter—


    Would any of the stock of Barrabas


    Had been her husband, rather than a Christian!—


    We trifle time; I pray thee pursue sentence.
PORTIA.
A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine.
The court awards it and the law doth give it.
SHYLOCK.
Most rightful judge!
PORTIA.
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.
The law allows it and the court awards it.
SHYLOCK.
Most learned judge!
A sentence!
Come, prepare.
PORTIA.
Tarry a little; there is something else.
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood:


    The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh.'
Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;


    But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed


    One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods


    Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate


    Unto the state of Venice.
GRATIANO.
O upright judge!
Mark, Jew.
O learned judge!
SHYLOCK.
Is that the law?
PORTIA.
Thyself shalt see the act;


    For, as thou urgest justice, be assur'd


    Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desir'st.
GRATIANO.
O learned judge!
Mark, Jew.
A learned judge!
SHYLOCK.
I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice,


    And let the Christian go.
BASSANIO.
Here is the money.
PORTIA.
Soft!
The Jew shall have all justice.
Soft!
No haste.
He shall have nothing but the penalty.
GRATIANO.
O Jew!
an upright judge, a learned judge!
PORTIA.
Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more


    But just a pound of flesh; if thou tak'st more


    Or less than a just pound- be it but so much


    As makes it light or heavy in the substance,


    Or the division of the twentieth part


    Of one poor scruple; nay, if the scale do turn


    But in the estimation of a hair-


    Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.
GRATIANO.
A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
PORTIA.
Why doth the Jew pause?
Take thy forfeiture.
SHYLOCK.
Give me my principal, and let me go.
BASSANIO.
I have it ready for thee; here it is.
PORTIA.
He hath refus'd it in the open court;


    He shall have merely justice, and his bond.
GRATIANO.
A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel!
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
SHYLOCK.
Shall I not have barely my principal?
PORTIA.
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture


    To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
SHYLOCK.
Why, then the devil give him good of it!
I'll stay no longer question.
PORTIA.
Tarry, Jew.
The law hath yet another hold on you.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,


    If it be proved against an alien


    That by direct or indirect attempts


    He seek the life of any citizen,


    The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive


    Shall seize one half his goods; the other half


    Comes to the privy coffer of the state;


    And the offender's life lies in the mercy


    Of the Duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;


    For it appears by manifest proceeding


    That indirectly, and directly too,


    Thou hast contrived against the very life


    Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd


    The danger formerly by me rehears'd.
Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.
GRATIANO.
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself;


    And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,


    Thou hast not left the value of a cord;


    Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
DUKE OF VENICE.
That thou shalt see the difference of our


spirit,


    I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;


    The other half comes to the general state,


    Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
PORTIA.
Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.
SHYLOCK.
Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that.
You take my house when you do take the prop


    That doth sustain my house; you take my life


    When you do take the means whereby I live.
PORTIA.
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
GRATIANO.
A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake!
ANTONIO.
So please my lord the Duke and all the court


    To quit the fine for one half of his goods;


    I am content, so he will let me have


    The other half in use, to render it


    Upon his death unto the gentleman


    That lately stole his daughter—


    Two things provided more; that, for this favour,


    He presently become a Christian;


    The other, that he do record a gift,


    Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd


    Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
DUKE OF VENICE.
He shall do this, or else I do recant


    The pardon that I late pronounced here.
PORTIA.
Art thou contented, Jew?
What dost thou say?
SHYLOCK.
I am content.
PORTIA.
Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
SHYLOCK.
I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;


    I am not well; send the deed after me


    And I will sign it.
DUKE OF VENICE.
Get thee gone, but do it.
GRATIANO.
In christ'ning shalt thou have two god-fathers;


    Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,


    To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.
Exit SHYLOCK.
DUKE OF VENICE.
Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
PORTIA.
I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon;


    I must away this night toward Padua,


    And it is meet I presently set forth.
DUKE OF VENICE.
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,


    For in my mind you are much bound to him.
Exeunt DUKE, MAGNIFICOES, and train.
BASSANIO.
Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend


    Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted


    Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof


    Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,


    We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
ANTONIO.
And stand indebted, over and above,


    In love and service to you evermore.
PORTIA.
He is well paid that is well satisfied,


    And I, delivering you, am satisfied,


    And therein do account myself well paid.
My mind was never yet more mercenary.
I pray you, know me when we meet again;


    I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
BASSANIO.
Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further;


    Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,


    Not as fee.
Grant me two things, I pray you,


    Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
PORTIA.
You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
[To ANTONIO]  Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your


sake.
[To BASSANIO]  And, for your love, I'll take this ring from


you.
Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more,


    And you in love shall not deny me this.
BASSANIO.
This ring, good sir- alas, it is a trifle;


    I will not shame myself to give you this.
PORTIA.
I will have nothing else but only this;


    And now, methinks, I have a mind to it.
BASSANIO..
There's more depends on this than on the value.
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,


    And find it out by proclamation;


    Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.
PORTIA.
I see, sir, you are liberal in offers;


    You taught me first to beg, and now, methinks,


    You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.
BASSANIO.
Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;


    And, when she put it on, she made me vow


    That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it.
PORTIA.
That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
And if your wife be not a mad woman,


    And know how well I have deserv'd this ring,


    She would not hold out enemy for ever


    For giving it to me.
Well, peace be with you!
Exeunt PORTIA and NERISSA.
ANTONIO.
My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
Let his deservings, and my love withal,


    Be valued 'gainst your wife's commandment.
BASSANIO.
Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;


    Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,


    Unto Antonio's house.
Away, make haste.
Exit GRATIANO.
Come, you and I will thither presently;


    And in the morning early will we both


    Fly toward Belmont.
Come, Antonio.
Exeunt


Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
  PORTIA.
Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed,


    And let him sign it; we'll away tonight,


    And be a day before our husbands home.
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
Enter GRATIANO
  GRATIANO.
Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en.
My Lord Bassanio, upon more advice,


    Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat


    Your company at dinner.
PORTIA.
That cannot be.
His ring I do accept most thankfully,


    And so, I pray you, tell him.
Furthermore,


    I pray you show my youth old Shylock's house.
GRATIANO.
That will I do.
NERISSA.
Sir, I would speak with you.
[Aside to PORTIA]  I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,


    Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
PORTIA.
[To NERISSA]  Thou Mayst, I warrant.
We shall have old


      swearing


    That they did give the rings away to men;


    But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.
[Aloud]  Away, make haste, thou know'st where I will tarry.
NERISSA.
Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
Exeunt


Enter LORENZO and JESSICA.
LORENZO.
The moon shines bright.
In such a night as this,


    When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees,


    And they did make no noise—in such a night,


    Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls,


    And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,


    Where Cressid lay that night.
JESSICA.
In such a night


    Did Thisby fearfully o'ertrip the dew,


    And saw the lion's shadow ere himself,


    And ran dismayed away.
LORENZO.
In such a night


    Stood Dido with a willow in her hand


    Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love


    To come again to Carthage.
JESSICA.
In such a night


    Medea gathered the enchanted herbs


    That did renew old AEson.
LORENZO.
In such a night


    Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,


    And with an unthrift love did run from Venice


    As far as Belmont.
JESSICA.
In such a night


    Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well,


    Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,


    And ne'er a true one.
LORENZO.
In such a night


    Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,


    Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
JESSICA.
I would out-night you, did no body come;


    But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.
Enter STEPHANO
  LORENZO.
Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
STEPHANO.
A friend.
LORENZO.
A friend!
What friend?
Your name, I pray you, friend?
STEPHANO.
Stephano is my name, and I bring word


    My mistress will before the break of day


    Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about


    By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays


    For happy wedlock hours.
LORENZO.
Who comes with her?
STEPHANO.
None but a holy hermit and her maid.
I pray you, is my master yet return'd?
LORENZO.
He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,


    And ceremoniously let us prepare


    Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
Enter LAUNCELOT
  LAUNCELOT.
Sola, sola!
wo ha, ho!
sola, sola!
LORENZO.
Who calls?
LAUNCELOT.
Sola!
Did you see Master Lorenzo?
Master Lorenzo!
Sola,


    sola!
LORENZO.
Leave holloaing, man.
Here!
LAUNCELOT.
Sola!
Where, where?
LORENZO.
Here!
LAUNCELOT.
Tell him there's a post come from my master with his


    horn full of good news; my master will be here ere morning.
Exit


  LORENZO.
Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
And yet no matter- why should we go in?
My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,


    Within the house, your mistress is at hand;


    And bring your music forth into the air.
Exit STEPHANO


    How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music


    Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night


    Become the touches of sweet harmony.
Sit, Jessica.
Look how the floor of heaven


    Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;


    There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st


    But in his motion like an angel sings,


    Still quiring to the young-ey'd cherubins;


    Such harmony is in immortal souls,


    But whilst this muddy vesture of decay


    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
Enter MUSICIANS.
Come, ho, and wake Diana with a hymn;


    With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear.
And draw her home with music.
[Music]


  JESSICA.
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
LORENZO.
The reason is your spirits are attentive;


    For do but note a wild and wanton herd,


    Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,


    Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,


    Which is the hot condition of their blood—


    If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,


    Or any air of music touch their ears,


    You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,


    Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze


    By the sweet power of music.
Therefore the poet


    Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods;


    Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,


    But music for the time doth change his nature.
The man that hath no music in himself,


    Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,


    Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;


    The motions of his spirit are dull:as night,


    And his affections dark as Erebus.
Let no such man be trusted.
Mark the music.
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA.
PORTIA.
That light we see is burning in my hall.
How far that little candle throws his beams!
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
NERISSA.
When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
PORTIA.
So doth the greater glory dim the less:


    A substitute shines brightly as a king


    Until a king be by, and then his state


    Empties itself, as doth an inland brook


    Into the main of waters.
Music!
hark!
NERISSA.
It is your music, madam, of the house.
PORTIA.
Nothing is good, I see, without respect;


    Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
NERISSA.
Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
PORTIA.
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark


    When neither is attended; and I think


    The nightingale, if she should sing by day,


    When every goose is cackling, would be thought


    No better a musician than the wren.
How many things by season season'd are


    To their right praise and true perfection!
Peace, ho!
The moon sleeps with Endymion,


    And would not be awak'd.
[Music ceases]


  LORENZO.
That is the voice,


    Or I am much deceiv'd, of Portia.
PORTIA.
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,


    By the bad voice.
LORENZO.
Dear lady, welcome home.
PORTIA.
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare,


    Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
Are they return'd?
LORENZO.
Madam, they are not yet;


    But there is come a messenger before,


    To signify their coming.
PORTIA.. Go in, Nerissa;


    Give order to my servants that they take


    No note at all of our being absent hence;


    Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.
[A tucket sounds]


  LORENZO.
Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet.
We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not.
PORTIA.
This night methinks is but the daylight sick;


    It looks a little paler; 'tis a day


    Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their followers.
BASSANIO.
We should hold day with the Antipodes,


    If you would walk in absence of the sun.
PORTIA.
Let me give light, but let me not be light,


    For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,


    And never be Bassanio so for me;


    But God sort all!
You are welcome home, my lord.
BASSANIO.
I thank you, madam; give welcome to my friend.
This is the man, this is Antonio,


    To whom I am so infinitely bound.
PORTIA.
You should in all sense be much bound to him,


    For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.
ANTONIO.
No more than I am well acquitted of.
PORTIA.
Sir, you are very welcome to our house.
It must appear in other ways than words,


    Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
GRATIANO.
[To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me


wrong;


    In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk.
Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,


    Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.
PORTIA.
A quarrel, ho, already!
What's the matter?
GRATIANO.
About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring


    That she did give me, whose posy was


    For all the world like cutler's poetry


    Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'
NERISSA.
What talk you of the posy or the value?
You swore to me, when I did give it you,


    That you would wear it till your hour of death,


    And that it should lie with you in your grave;


    Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,


    You should have been respective and have kept it.
Gave it a judge's clerk!
No, God's my judge,


    The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.
GRATIANO.
He will, an if he live to be a man.
NERISSA.
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
GRATIANO.
Now by this hand I gave it to a youth,


    A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy


    No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk;


    A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee;


    I could not for my heart deny it him.
PORTIA.
You were to blame, I must be plain with you,


    To part so slightly with your wife's first gift,


    A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger


    And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
I gave my love a ring, and made him swear


    Never to part with it, and here he stands;


    I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it


    Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth


    That the world masters.
Now, in faith, Gratiano,


    You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief;


    An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.
BASSANIO.
[Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,


    And swear I lost the ring defending it.
GRATIANO.
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away


    Unto the judge that begg'd it, and indeed


    Deserv'd it too; and then the boy, his clerk,


    That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;


    And neither man nor master would take aught


    But the two rings.
PORTIA.
What ring gave you, my lord?
Not that, I hope, which you receiv'd of me.
BASSANIO.
If I could add a lie unto a fault,


    I would deny it; but you see my finger


    Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.
PORTIA.
Even so void is your false heart of truth;


    By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed


    Until I see the ring.
NERISSA.
Nor I in yours


    Till I again see mine.
BASSANIO.
Sweet Portia,


    If you did know to whom I gave the ring,


    If you did know for whom I gave the ring,


    And would conceive for what I gave the ring,


    And how unwillingly I left the ring,


    When nought would be accepted but the ring,


    You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
PORTIA.
If you had known the virtue of the ring,


    Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,


    Or your own honour to contain the ring,


    You would not then have parted with the ring.
What man is there so much unreasonable,


    If you had pleas'd to have defended it


    With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty


    To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:


    I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.
BASSANIO.
No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,


    No woman had it, but a civil doctor,


    Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,


    And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him,


    And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away-


    Even he that had held up the very life


    Of my dear friend.
What should I say, sweet lady?
I was enforc'd to send it after him;


    I was beset with shame and courtesy;


    My honour would not let ingratitude


    So much besmear it.
Pardon me, good lady;


    For by these blessed candles of the night,


    Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd


    The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
PORTIA.
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house;


    Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,


    And that which you did swear to keep for me,


    I will become as liberal as you;


    I'll not deny him anything I have,


    No, not my body, nor my husband's bed.
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus;


    If you do not, if I be left alone,


    Now, by mine honour which is yet mine own,


    I'll have that doctor for mine bedfellow.
NERISSA.
And I his clerk; therefore be well advis'd


    How you do leave me to mine own protection.
GRATIANO.
Well, do you so, let not me take him then;


    For, if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.
ANTONIO.
I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.
PORTIA.
Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome not withstanding.
BASSANIO.
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;


    And in the hearing of these many friends


    I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,


    Wherein I see myself-


  PORTIA.
Mark you but that!
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,


    In each eye one; swear by your double self,


    And there's an oath of credit.
BASSANIO.
Nay, but hear me.
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear


    I never more will break an oath with thee.
ANTONIO.
I once did lend my body for his wealth,


    Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,


    Had quite miscarried; I dare be bound again,


    My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord


    Will never more break faith advisedly.
PORTIA.
Then you shall be his surety.
Give him this,


    And bid him keep it better than the other.
ANTONIO.
Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
BASSANIO.
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
PORTIA.
I had it of him.
Pardon me, Bassanio,


    For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
NERISSA.
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,


    For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,


    In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.
GRATIANO.
Why, this is like the mending of highways


    In summer, where the ways are fair enough.
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv'd it?
PORTIA.
Speak not so grossly.
You are all amaz'd.
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;


    It comes from Padua, from Bellario;


    There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,


    Nerissa there her clerk.
Lorenzo here


    Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,


    And even but now return'd; I have not yet


    Enter'd my house.
Antonio, you are welcome;


    And I have better news in store for you


    Than you expect.
Unseal this letter soon;


    There you shall find three of your argosies


    Are richly come to harbour suddenly.
You shall not know by what strange accident


    I chanced on this letter.
ANTONIO.
I am dumb.
BASSANIO.
Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?
GRATIANO.
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
NERISSA.
Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,


    Unless he live until he be a man.
BASSANIO.
Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow;


    When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
ANTONIO.
Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;


    For here I read for certain that my ships


    Are safely come to road.
PORTIA.
How now, Lorenzo!
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
NERISSA.
Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
There do I give to you and Jessica,


    From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,


    After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.
LORENZO.
Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way


    Of starved people.
PORTIA.

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.
The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.
This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.
If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.
[10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]

Enter three Witches.
FIRST WITCH.
When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
SECOND WITCH.
When the hurlyburly's done,


    When the battle's lost and won.
THIRD WITCH.
That will be ere the set of sun.
FIRST WITCH.
Where the place?
SECOND WITCH.
Upon the heath.
THIRD WITCH.
There to meet with Macbeth.
FIRST WITCH.
I come, Graymalkin.
ALL.
Paddock calls.
Anon!
Fair is foul, and foul is fair.
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
Exeunt.
Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, with Attendants,
meeting a bleeding Sergeant.
DUNCAN.
What bloody man is that?
He can report,


    As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt


    The newest state.
MALCOLM.
This is the sergeant


    Who like a good and hardy soldier fought


    'Gainst my captivity.
Hail, brave friend!
Say to the King the knowledge of the broil


    As thou didst leave it.
SERGEANT.
Doubtful it stood,


    As two spent swimmers that do cling together


    And choke their art.
The merciless Macdonwald-


    Worthy to be a rebel, for to that


    The multiplying villainies of nature


    Do swarm upon him -from the Western Isles


    Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;


    And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,


    Show'd like a rebel's whore.
But all's too weak;


    For brave Macbeth -well he deserves that name-


    Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish'd steel,


    Which smoked with bloody execution,


    Like Valor's minion carved out his passage


    Till he faced the slave,


    Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,


    Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,


    And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
DUNCAN.
O valiant cousin!
Worthy gentleman!
SERGEANT.
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection


    Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,


    So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come


    Discomfort swells.
Mark, King of Scotland, mark.
No sooner justice had, with valor arm'd,


    Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,


    But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,


    With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men,


    Began a fresh assault.
DUNCAN.
Dismay'd not this


    Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
SERGEANT.
Yes,


    As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
If I say sooth, I must report they were


    As cannons overcharged with double cracks,


    So they


    Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,


    Or memorize another Golgotha,


    I cannot tell-


    But I am faint; my gashes cry for help.
DUNCAN.
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;


    They smack of honor both.
Go get him surgeons.
Exit Sergeant, attended.
Who comes here?
Enter Ross.
MALCOLM.
The worthy Thane of Ross.
LENNOX.
What a haste looks through his eyes!
So should he look


    That seems to speak things strange.
ROSS.
God save the King!
DUNCAN.
Whence camest thou, worthy Thane?
ROSS.
From Fife, great King,


    Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky


    And fan our people cold.
Norway himself, with terrible numbers,


    Assisted by that most disloyal traitor


    The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,


    Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,


    Confronted him with self-comparisons,


    Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm,


    Curbing his lavish spirit; and, to conclude,


    The victory fell on us.
DUNCAN.
Great happiness!
ROSS.
That now


    Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition;


    Nor would we deign him burial of his men


    Till he disbursed, at Saint Colme's Inch,


    Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
DUNCAN.
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive


    Our bosom interest.
Go pronounce his present death,


    And with his former title greet Macbeth.
ROSS.
I'll see it done.
DUNCAN.
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.
Exeunt.
Enter the three Witches.
FIRST WITCH.
Where hast thou been, sister?
SECOND WITCH.
Killing swine.
THIRD WITCH.
Sister, where thou?
FIRST WITCH.
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,


    And mounch'd, and mounch'd, and mounch'd.
"Give me," quoth I.
"Aroint thee, witch!"
the rump-fed ronyon cries.
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger;


    But in a sieve I'll thither sail,


    And, like a rat without a tail,


    I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
SECOND WITCH.
I'll give thee a wind.
FIRST WITCH.
Thou'rt kind.
THIRD WITCH.
And I another.
FIRST WITCH.
I myself have all the other,


    And the very ports they blow,


    All the quarters that they know


    I' the shipman's card.
I will drain him dry as hay:


    Sleep shall neither night nor day


    Hang upon his penthouse lid;


    He shall live a man forbid.
Weary se'nnights nine times nine


    Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine;


    Though his bark cannot be lost,


    Yet it shall be tempest-toss'd.
Look what I have.
SECOND WITCH.
Show me, show me.
FIRST WITCH.
Here I have a pilot's thumb,


    Wreck'd as homeward he did come.
Drum within.
THIRD WITCH.
A drum, a drum!
Macbeth doth come.
ALL.
The weird sisters, hand in hand,


    Posters of the sea and land,


    Thus do go about, about,


    Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,


    And thrice again, to make up nine.
Peace!
The charm's wound up.
Enter Macbeth and Banquo.
MACBETH.
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
BANQUO.
How far is't call'd to Forres?
What are these


    So wither'd and so wild in their attire,


    That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,


    And yet are on't?
Live you?
or are you aught


    That man may question?
You seem to understand me,


    By each at once her choppy finger laying


    Upon her skinny lips.
You should be women,


    And yet your beards forbid me to interpret


    That you are so.
MACBETH.
Speak, if you can.
What are you?
FIRST WITCH.
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!
SECOND WITCH.
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
THIRD WITCH.
All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter!
BANQUO.
Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear


    Things that do sound so fair?
I' the name of truth,


    Are ye fantastical or that indeed


    Which outwardly ye show?
My noble partner


    You greet with present grace and great prediction


    Of noble having and of royal hope,


    That he seems rapt withal.
To me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time,


    And say which grain will grow and which will not,


    Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear


    Your favors nor your hate.
FIRST WITCH.
Hail!
SECOND WITCH.
Hail!
THIRD WITCH.
Hail!
FIRST WITCH.
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
SECOND WITCH.
Not so happy, yet much happier.
THIRD WITCH.
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
FIRST WITCH.
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
MACBETH.
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.
By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis;


    But how of Cawdor?
The Thane of Cawdor lives,


    A prosperous gentleman; and to be King


    Stands not within the prospect of belief,


    No more than to be Cawdor.
Say from whence


    You owe this strange intelligence, or why


    Upon this blasted heath you stop our way


    With such prophetic greeting?
Speak, I charge you.
Witches vanish.
BANQUO.
The earth hath bubbles as the water has,


    And these are of them.
Whither are they vanish'd?
MACBETH.
Into the air, and what seem'd corporal melted


    As breath into the wind.
Would they had stay'd!
BANQUO.
Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root


    That takes the reason prisoner?
MACBETH.
Your children shall be kings.
BANQUO.
You shall be King.
MACBETH.
And Thane of Cawdor too.
Went it not so?
BANQUO.
To the selfsame tune and words.
Who's here?
Enter Ross and Angus.
ROSS.
The King hath happily received, Macbeth,


    The news of thy success; and when he reads


    Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,


    His wonders and his praises do contend


    Which should be thine or his.
Silenced with that,


    In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,


    He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,


    Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,


    Strange images of death.
As thick as hail


    Came post with post, and every one did bear


    Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense,


    And pour'd them down before him.
ANGUS.
We are sent


    To give thee, from our royal master, thanks;


    Only to herald thee into his sight,


    Not pay thee.
ROSS.
And for an earnest of a greater honor,


    He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor.
In which addition, hail, most worthy Thane,


    For it is thine.
BANQUO.
What, can the devil speak true?
MACBETH.
The Thane of Cawdor lives.
Why do you dress me


    In borrow'd robes?
ANGUS.
Who was the Thane lives yet,


    But under heavy judgement bears that life


    Which he deserves to lose.
Whether he was combined


    With those of Norway, or did line the rebel


    With hidden help and vantage, or that with both


    He labor'd in his country's wreck, I know not;


    But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,


    Have overthrown him.
MACBETH.
[Aside.]
Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor!
The greatest is behind.
[To Ross and Angus] Thanks for your


      pains.
[Aside to Banquo] Do you not hope your children shall be


kings,


    When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me


    Promised no less to them?
BANQUO.
[Aside to Macbeth.]
That, trusted home,


    Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,


    Besides the Thane of Cawdor.
But 'tis strange;


    And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,


    The instruments of darkness tell us truths,


    Win us with honest trifles, to betray's


    In deepest consequence-


    Cousins, a word, I pray you.
MACBETH.
[Aside.]
Two truths are told,


    As happy prologues to the swelling act


    Of the imperial theme-I thank you, gentlemen.
[Aside.]
This supernatural soliciting


    Cannot be ill, cannot be good.
If ill,


    Why hath it given me earnest of success,


    Commencing in a truth?
I am Thane of Cawdor.
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion


    Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair


    And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,


    Against the use of nature?
Present fears


    Are less than horrible imaginings:


    My thought, whose murther yet is but fantastical,


    Shakes so my single state of man that function


    Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is


    But what is not.
BANQUO.
Look, how our partner's rapt.
MACBETH.
[Aside.]
If chance will have me King, why, chance may


      crown me


    Without my stir.
BANQUO.
New honors come upon him,


    Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould


    But with the aid of use.
MACBETH.
[Aside.]
Come what come may,


    Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
BANQUO.
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
MACBETH.
Give me your favor; my dull brain was wrought


    With things forgotten.
Kind gentlemen, your pains


    Are register'd where every day I turn


    The leaf to read them.
Let us toward the King.
Think upon what hath chanced, and at more time,


    The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak


    Our free hearts each to other.
BANQUO.
Very gladly.
MACBETH.
Till then, enough.
Come, friends.
Exeunt.
Flourish.
Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, and


Attendants.
DUNCAN.
Is execution done on Cawdor?
Are not


    Those in commission yet return'd?
MALCOLM.
My liege,


    They are not yet come back.
But I have spoke


    With one that saw him die, who did report


    That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,


    Implored your Highness' pardon, and set forth


    A deep repentance.
Nothing in his life


    Became him like the leaving it; he died


    As one that had been studied in his death,


    To throw away the dearest thing he owed


    As 'twere a careless trifle.
DUNCAN.
There's no art


    To find the mind's construction in the face:


    He was a gentleman on whom I built


    An absolute trust.
Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus.
O worthiest cousin!
The sin of my ingratitude even now


    Was heavy on me.
Thou art so far before,


    That swiftest wing of recompense is slow


    To overtake thee.
Would thou hadst less deserved,


    That the proportion both of thanks and payment


    Might have been mine!
Only I have left to say,


    More is thy due than more than all can pay.
MACBETH.
The service and the loyalty I owe,


    In doing it, pays itself.
Your Highness' part


    Is to receive our duties, and our duties


    Are to your throne and state, children and servants,


    Which do but what they should, by doing everything


    Safe toward your love and honor.
DUNCAN.
Welcome hither.
I have begun to plant thee, and will labor


    To make thee full of growing.
Noble Banquo,


    That hast no less deserved, nor must be known


    No less to have done so; let me infold thee


    And hold thee to my heart.
BANQUO.
There if I grow,


    The harvest is your own.
DUNCAN.
My plenteous joys,


    Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves


    In drops of sorrow.
Sons, kinsmen, thanes,


    And you whose places are the nearest, know


    We will establish our estate upon


    Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter


    The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must


    Not unaccompanied invest him only,


    But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine


    On all deservers.
From hence to Inverness,


    And bind us further to you.
MACBETH.
The rest is labor, which is not used for you.
I'll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful


    The hearing of my wife with your approach;


    So humbly take my leave.
DUNCAN.
My worthy Cawdor!
MACBETH.
[Aside.]
The Prince of Cumberland!
That is a step


    On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,


    For in my way it lies.
Stars, hide your fires;


    Let not light see my black and deep desires.
The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be


    Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.
Exit.
DUNCAN.
True, worthy Banquo!
He is full so valiant,


    And in his commendations I am fed;


    It is a banquet to me.
Let's after him,


    Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome.
It is a peerless kinsman.
Flourish.
Exeunt.
Enter Lady Macbeth, reading a letter.
LADY MACBETH.
"They met me in the day of success, and I have


    learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than


    mortal knowledge.
When I burned in desire to question them


    further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.
Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from


the


    King, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor'; by which title,


    before, these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the


    coming on of time with 'Hail, King that shalt be!'
This have


I


    thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of


greatness,


    that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being


    ignorant of what greatness is promised thee.
Lay it to thy


heart,


    and farewell."
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be


    What thou art promised.
Yet do I fear thy nature.
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness


    To catch the nearest way.
Thou wouldst be great;


    Art not without ambition, but without


    The illness should attend it.
What thou wouldst highly,


    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,


    And yet wouldst wrongly win.
Thou'ldst have, great Glamis,


    That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it;


    And that which rather thou dost fear to do


    Than wishest should be undone."
Hie thee hither,


    That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,


    And chastise with the valor of my tongue


    All that impedes thee from the golden round,


    Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem


    To have thee crown'd withal.
Enter a Messenger.
What is your tidings?
MESSENGER.
The King comes here tonight.
LADY MACBETH.
Thou'rt mad to say it!
Is not thy master with him?
who, were't so,


    Would have inform'd for preparation.
MESSENGER.
So please you, it is true; our Thane is coming.
One of my fellows had the speed of him,


    Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more


    Than would make up his message.
LADY MACBETH.
Give him tending;


    He brings great news.
Exit Messenger.
The raven himself is hoarse


    That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan


    Under my battlements.
Come, you spirits


    That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here


    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full


    Of direst cruelty!
Make thick my blood,


    Stop up the access and passage to remorse,


    That no compunctious visitings of nature


    Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between


    The effect and it!
Come to my woman's breasts,


    And take my milk for gall, your murthering ministers,


    Wherever in your sightless substances


    You wait on nature's mischief!
Come, thick night,


    And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell


    That my keen knife see not the wound it makes


    Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark


    To cry, "Hold, hold!"
Enter Macbeth.
Great Glamis!
Worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond


    This ignorant present, and I feel now


    The future in the instant.
MACBETH.
My dearest love,


    Duncan comes here tonight.
LADY MACBETH.
And when goes hence?
MACBETH.
Tomorrow, as he purposes.
LADY MACBETH.
O, never


    Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my Thane, is as a book where men


    May read strange matters.
To beguile the time,


    Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,


    Your hand, your tongue; look like the innocent flower,


    But be the serpent under it.
He that's coming


    Must be provided for; and you shall put


    This night's great business into my dispatch,


    Which shall to all our nights and days to come


    Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
MACBETH.
We will speak further.
LADY MACBETH.
Only look up clear;


    To alter favor ever is to fear.
Leave all the rest to me.
Exeunt.
Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo, Lennox, Macduff, Ross,
Angus,
and Attendants.
DUNCAN.
This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air


    Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself


    Unto our gentle senses.
BANQUO.
This guest of summer,


    The temple-haunting martlet, does approve


    By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath


    Smells wooingly here.
No jutty, frieze,


    Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird


    Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle;


    Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed


    The air is delicate.
Enter Lady Macbeth.
DUNCAN.
See, see, our honor'd hostess!
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,


    Which still we thank as love.
Herein I teach you


    How you shall bid God 'ield us for your pains,


    And thank us for your trouble.
LADY MACBETH.
All our service


    In every point twice done, and then done double,


    Were poor and single business to contend


    Against those honors deep and broad wherewith


    Your Majesty loads our house.
For those of old,


    And the late dignities heap'd up to them,


    We rest your hermits.
DUNCAN.
Where's the Thane of Cawdor?
We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose


    To be his purveyor; but he rides well,


    And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him


    To his home before us.
Fair and noble hostess,


    We are your guest tonight.
LADY MACBETH.
Your servants ever


    Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,


    To make their audit at your Highness' pleasure,


    Still to return your own.
DUNCAN.
Give me your hand;


    Conduct me to mine host.
We love him highly,


    And shall continue our graces towards him.
By your leave, hostess.
Exeunt.
Enter a Sewer and divers Servants with dishes and service, who
pass over
the stage.
Then enter Macbeth.
MACBETH.
If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well


    It were done quickly.
If the assassination


    Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,


    With his surcease, success; that but this blow


    Might be the be-all and the end-all -here,


    But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,


    We'ld jump the life to come.
But in these cases


    We still have judgement here, that we but teach


    Bloody instructions, which being taught return


    To plague the inventor.
This even-handed justice


    Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice


    To our own lips.
He's here in double trust:


    First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,


    Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,


    Who should against his murtherer shut the door,


    Not bear the knife myself.
Besides, this Duncan


    Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been


    So clear in his great office, that his virtues


    Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against


    The deep damnation of his taking-off,


    And pity, like a naked new-born babe


    Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed


    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,


    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,


    That tears shall drown the wind.
I have no spur


    To prick the sides of my intent, but only


    Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself


    And falls on the other.
Enter Lady Macbeth.
How now, what news?
LADY MACBETH.
He has almost supp'd.
Why have you left the


chamber?
MACBETH.
Hath he ask'd for me?
LADY MACBETH.
Know you not he has?
MACBETH.
We will proceed no further in this business:


    He hath honor'd me of late, and I have bought


    Golden opinions from all sorts of people,


    Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,


    Not cast aside so soon.
LADY MACBETH.
Was the hope drunk


    Wherein you dress'd yourself?
Hath it slept since?
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale


    At what it did so freely?
From this time


    Such I account thy love.
Art thou afeard


    To be the same in thine own act and valor


    As thou art in desire?
Wouldst thou have that


    Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life


    And live a coward in thine own esteem,


    Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would"


    Like the poor cat i' the adage?
MACBETH.
Prithee, peace!
I dare do all that may become a man;


    Who dares do more is none.
LADY MACBETH.
What beast wast then


    That made you break this enterprise to me?
When you durst do it, then you were a man,


    And, to be more than what you were, you would


    Be so much more the man.
Nor time nor place


    Did then adhere, and yet you would make both.
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now


    Does unmake you.
I have given suck and know


    How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me-


    I would, while it was smiling in my face,


    Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums


    And dash'd the brains out had I so sworn as you


    Have done to this.
MACBETH.
If we should fail?
LADY MACBETH.
We fail?
But screw your courage to the sticking-place


    And we'll not fail.
When Duncan is asleep-


    Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey


    Soundly invite him- his two chamberlains


    Will I with wine and wassail so convince


    That memory, the warder of the brain,


    Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason


    A limbeck only.
When in swinish sleep


    Their drenched natures lie as in a death,


    What cannot you and I perform upon


    The unguarded Duncan?
What not put upon


    His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt


    Of our great quell?
MACBETH.
Bring forth men-children only,


    For thy undaunted mettle should compose


    Nothing but males.
Will it not be received,


    When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two


    Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,


    That they have done't?
LADY MACBETH.
Who dares receive it other,


    As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar


    Upon his death?
MACBETH.
I am settled and bend up


    Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
Away, and mock the time with fairest show:


    False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
Exeunt.

Enter Banquo and Fleance, bearing a torch before him.
BANQUO.
How goes the night, boy?
FLEANCE.
The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.
BANQUO.
And she goes down at twelve.
FLEANCE.
I take't 'tis later, sir.
BANQUO.
Hold, take my sword.
There's husbandry in heaven,


    Their candles are all out.
Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,


    And yet I would not sleep.
Merciful powers,


    Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature


    Gives way to in repose!
Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch.
Give me my sword.
Who's there?
MACBETH.
A friend.
BANQUO.
What, sir, not yet at rest?
The King's abed.
He hath been in unusual pleasure and


    Sent forth great largess to your offices.
This diamond he greets your wife withal,


    By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up


    In measureless content.
MACBETH.
Being unprepared,


    Our will became the servant to defect,


    Which else should free have wrought.
BANQUO.
All's well.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:


    To you they have show'd some truth.
MACBETH.
I think not of them;


    Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,


    We would spend it in some words upon that business,


    If you would grant the time.
BANQUO.
At your kind'st leisure.
MACBETH.
If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,


    It shall make honor for you.
BANQUO.
So I lose none


    In seeking to augment it, but still keep


    My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,


    I shall be counsel'd.
MACBETH.
Good repose the while.
BANQUO.
Thanks, sir, the like to you.
Exeunt Banquo and Fleance.
MACBETH.
Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,


    She strike upon the bell.
Get thee to bed.
Exit Servant.
Is this a dagger which I see before me,


    The handle toward my hand?
Come, let me clutch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible


    To feeling as to sight?
Or art thou but


    A dagger of the mind, a false creation,


    Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable


    As this which now I draw.
Thou marshal'st me the way that I was going,


    And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,


    Or else worth all the rest.
I see thee still,


    And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,


    Which was not so before.
There's no such thing:


    It is the bloody business which informs


    Thus to mine eyes.
Now o'er the one half-world


    Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse


    The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates


    Pale Hecate's offerings; and wither'd Murther,


    Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,


    Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,


    With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design


    Moves like a ghost.
Thou sure and firm-set earth,


    Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear


    Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,


    And take the present horror from the time,


    Which now suits with it.
Whiles I threat, he lives;


    Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
A bell rings.
I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell


    That summons thee to heaven, or to hell.
Exit.
Enter Lady Macbeth.
LADY MACBETH.
That which hath made them drunk hath made me


bold;


    What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
Hark!
Peace!
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,


    Which gives the stern'st good night.
He is about it:


    The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms


    Do mock their charge with snores.
I have drugg'd their


possets


    That death and nature do contend about them,


    Whether they live or die.
MACBETH.
[Within.]
Who's there?
what, ho!
LADY MACBETH.
Alack, I am afraid they have awaked


    And 'tis not done.
The attempt and not the deed


    Confounds us.
Hark!
I laid their daggers ready;


    He could not miss 'em.
Had he not resembled


    My father as he slept, I had done't.
Enter Macbeth.
My husband!
MACBETH.
I have done the deed.
Didst thou not hear a noise?
LADY MACBETH.
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?
MACBETH.
When?
LADY MACBETH.
Now.
MACBETH.
As I descended?
LADY MACBETH.
Ay.
MACBETH.
Hark!
Who lies i' the second chamber?
LADY MACBETH.
Donalbain.
MACBETH.
This is a sorry sight.
[Looks on his hands.
LADY MACBETH.
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
MACBETH.
There's one did laugh in 's sleep, and one cried,


      "Murther!"
That they did wake each other.
I stood and heard them,


    But they did say their prayers and address'd them


    Again to sleep.
LADY MACBETH.
There are two lodged together.
MACBETH.
One cried, "God bless us!"
and "Amen" the other,


    As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
Listening their fear, I could not say "Amen,"


    When they did say, "God bless us!"
LADY MACBETH.
Consider it not so deeply.
MACBETH.
But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen"?
I had most need of blessing, and "Amen"


    Stuck in my throat.
LADY MACBETH.
These deeds must not be thought


    After these ways; so, it will make us mad.
MACBETH.
I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murther sleep" -the innocent sleep,


    Sleep that knits up the ravel'd sleave of care,


    The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,


    Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,


    Chief nourisher in life's feast-


  LADY MACBETH.
What do you mean?
MACBETH.
Still it cried, "Sleep no more!"
to all the house;


    "Glamis hath murther'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor


    Shall sleep no more.
Macbeth shall sleep no more."
LADY MACBETH.
Who was it that thus cried?
Why, worthy Thane,


    You do unbend your noble strength, to think


    So brainsickly of things.
Go, get some water


    And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there.
Go carry them, and smear


    The sleepy grooms with blood.
MACBETH.
I'll go no more.
I am afraid to think what I have done;


    Look on't again I dare not.
LADY MACBETH.
Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers.
The sleeping and the dead


    Are but as pictures; 'tis the eye of childhood


    That fears a painted devil.
If he do bleed,


    I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,


    For it must seem their guilt.
Exit.
Knocking within.
MACBETH.
Whence is that knocking?
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
What hands are here?
Ha, they pluck out mine eyes!
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood


    Clean from my hand?
No, this my hand will rather


    The multitudinous seas incarnadine,


    Making the green one red.
Re-enter Lady Macbeth.
LADY MACBETH.
My hands are of your color, but I shame


    To wear a heart so white.
[Knocking within.]
I hear knocking


    At the south entry.
Retire we to our chamber.
A little water clears us of this deed.
How easy is it then!
Your constancy


    Hath left you unattended.
[Knocking within.]
Hark, more


knocking.
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us


    And show us to be watchers.
Be not lost


    So poorly in your thoughts.
MACBETH.
To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
Knocking within.
Wake Duncan with thy knocking!
I would thou couldst!
Exeunt.
Enter a Porter.
Knocking within.
PORTER.
Here's a knocking indeed!
If a man were porter of Hell


    Gate, he should have old turning the key.
[Knocking within.]
Knock, knock, knock!
Who's there, i' the name of Belzebub?
Here's


    a farmer that hanged himself on th' expectation of plenty.
Come


    in time!
Have napkins enow about you; here you'll sweat


for't.
[Knocking within.]
Knock, knock!
Who's there, in th' other


    devil's name?
Faith, here's an equivocator that could swear


in


    both the scales against either scale, who committed treason


    enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven.
O,


    come in, equivocator.
[Knocking within.]
Knock, knock, knock!
Who's there?
Faith, here's an English tailor come hither, for


    stealing out of a French hose.
Come in, tailor; here you may


    roast your goose.
[Knocking within.]
Knock, knock!
Never at


    quiet!
What are you?
But this place is too cold for hell.
I'll


    devil-porter it no further.
I had thought to have let in some


of


    all professions, that go the primrose way to the everlasting


    bonfire.
[Knocking within.]
Anon, anon!
I pray you, remember


the


    porter.
Opens the gate.
Enter Macduff and Lennox.
MACDUFF.
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,


    That you do lie so late?
PORTER.
Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and


    drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.
MACDUFF.
What three things does drink especially provoke?
PORTER.
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine.
Lechery,


sir,


    it provokes and unprovokes: it provokes the desire, but it


takes


    away the performance.
Therefore much drink may be said to be


an


    equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it


sets


    him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him and


disheartens


    him; makes him stand to and not stand to; in conclusion,


    equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves


him.
MACDUFF.
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
PORTER.
That it did, sir, i' the very throat on me; but


requited


    him for his lie, and, I think, being too strong for him,


though


    he took up my legs sometime, yet I made shift to cast him.
MACDUFF.
Is thy master stirring?
Enter Macbeth.
Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.
LENNOX.
Good morrow, noble sir.
MACBETH.
Good morrow, both.
MACDUFF.
Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?
MACBETH.
Not yet.
MACDUFF.
He did command me to call timely on him;


    I have almost slipp'd the hour.
MACBETH.
I'll bring you to him.
MACDUFF.
I know this is a joyful trouble to you,


    But yet 'tis one.
MACBETH.
The labor we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.
MACDUFF.
I'll make so bold to call,


    For 'tis my limited service.
Exit.
LENNOX.
Goes the King hence today?
MACBETH.
He does; he did appoint so.
LENNOX.
The night has been unruly.
Where we lay,


    Our chimneys were blown down, and, as they say,


    Lamentings heard i' the air, strange screams of death,


    And prophesying with accents terrible


    Of dire combustion and confused events


    New hatch'd to the woeful time.
The obscure bird


    Clamor'd the livelong night.
Some say the earth


    Was feverous and did shake.
MACBETH.
'Twas a rough night.
LENNOX.
My young remembrance cannot parallel


    A fellow to it.
Re-enter Macduff.
MACDUFF.
O horror, horror, horror!
Tongue nor heart


    Cannot conceive nor name thee.
MACBETH.
LENNOX.
What's the matter?
MACDUFF.
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.
Most sacrilegious murther hath broke ope


    The Lord's anointed temple and stole thence


    The life o' the building.
MACBETH.
What is't you say?
the life?
LENNOX.
Mean you his Majesty?
MACDUFF.
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight


    With a new Gorgon.
Do not bid me speak;


    See, and then speak yourselves.
Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox.
Awake, awake!
Ring the alarum bell.
Murther and treason!
Banquo and Donalbain!
Malcolm, awake!
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,


    And look on death itself!
Up, up, and see


    The great doom's image!
Malcolm!
Banquo!
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites


    To countenance this horror!
Ring the bell.
Bell rings.
Enter Lady Macbeth.
LADY MACBETH.
What's the business,


    That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley


    The sleepers of the house?
Speak, speak!
MACDUFF.
O gentle lady,


    'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:


    The repetition in a woman's ear


    Would murther as it fell.
Enter Banquo.
O Banquo, Banquo!
Our royal master's murther'd.
LADY MACBETH.
Woe, alas!
What, in our house?
BANQUO.
Too cruel anywhere.
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,


    And say it is not so.
Re-enter Macbeth and Lennox, with Ross.
MACBETH.
Had I but died an hour before this chance,


    I had lived a blessed time, for from this instant


    There's nothing serious in mortality.
All is but toys; renown and grace is dead,


    The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees


    Is left this vault to brag of.
Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.
DONALBAIN.
What is amiss?
MACBETH.
You are, and do not know't.
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood


    Is stopped, the very source of it is stopp'd.
MACDUFF.
Your royal father's murther'd.
MALCOLM.
O, by whom?
LENNOX.
Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done't.
Their hands and faces were all badged with blood;


    So were their daggers, which unwiped we found


    Upon their pillows.
They stared, and were distracted; no man's life


    Was to be trusted with them.
MACBETH.
O, yet I do repent me of my fury,


    That I did kill them.
MACDUFF.
Wherefore did you so?
MACBETH.
Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,


    Loyal and neutral, in a moment?
No man.
The expedition of my violent love


    Outrun the pauser reason.
Here lay Duncan,


    His silver skin laced with his golden blood,


    And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature


    For ruin's wasteful entrance; there, the murtherers,


    Steep'd in the colors of their trade, their daggers


    Unmannerly breech'd with gore.
Who could refrain,


    That had a heart to love, and in that heart


    Courage to make 's love known?
LADY MACBETH.
Help me hence, ho!
MACDUFF.
Look to the lady.
MALCOLM.
[Aside to Donalbain.]
Why do we hold our tongues,


    That most may claim this argument for ours?
DONALBAIN.
[Aside to Malcolm.]
What should be spoken here,


where


      our fate,


    Hid in an auger hole, may rush and seize us?
Let's away,


    Our tears are not yet brew'd.
MALCOLM.
[Aside to Donalbain.]
Nor our strong sorrow


    Upon the foot of motion.
BANQUO.
Look to the lady.
Lady Macbeth is carried out.
And when we have our naked frailties hid,


    That suffer in exposure, let us meet


    And question this most bloody piece of work


    To know it further.
Fears and scruples shake us.
In the great hand of God I stand, and thence


    Against the undivulged pretense I fight


    Of treasonous malice.
MACDUFF.
And so do I.
ALL.
So all.
MACBETH.
Let's briefly put on manly readiness


    And meet i' the hall together.
ALL.
Well contented.
Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.
MALCOLM.
What will you do?
Let's not consort with them.
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office


    Which the false man does easy.
I'll to England.
DONALBAIN.
To Ireland, I; our separated fortune


    Shall keep us both the safer.
Where we are


    There's daggers in men's smiles; the near in blood,


    The nearer bloody.
MALCOLM.
This murtherous shaft that's shot


    Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way


    Is to avoid the aim.
Therefore to horse;


    And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,


    But shift away.
There's warrant in that theft


    Which steals itself when there's no mercy left.
Exeunt.
Enter Ross with an Old Man.
OLD MAN.
Threescore and ten I can remember well,


    Within the volume of which time I have seen


    Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night


    Hath trifled former knowings.
ROSS.
Ah, good father,


    Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man's act,


    Threaten his bloody stage.
By the clock 'tis day,


    And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp.
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,


    That darkness does the face of earth entomb,


    When living light should kiss it?
OLD MAN.
'Tis unnatural,


    Even like the deed that's done.
On Tuesday last


    A falcon towering in her pride of place


    Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.
ROSS.
And Duncan's horses-a thing most strange and certain-


    Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,


    Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,


    Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make


    War with mankind.
OLD MAN.
'Tis said they eat each other.
ROSS.
They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes


    That look'd upon't.
Enter Macduff.
Here comes the good Macduff.
How goes the world, sir, now?
MACDUFF.
Why, see you not?
ROSS.
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?
MACDUFF.
Those that Macbeth hath slain.
ROSS.
Alas, the day!
What good could they pretend?
MACDUFF.
They were suborn'd:


    Malcolm and Donalbain, the King's two sons,


    Are stol'n away and fled, which puts upon them


    Suspicion of the deed.
ROSS.
'Gainst nature still!
Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up


    Thine own life's means!
Then 'tis most like


    The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
MACDUFF.
He is already named, and gone to Scone


    To be invested.
ROSS.
Where is Duncan's body?
MACDUFF.
Carried to Colmekill,


    The sacred storehouse of his predecessors


    And guardian of their bones.
ROSS.
Will you to Scone?
MACDUFF.
No, cousin, I'll to Fife.
ROSS.
Well, I will thither.
MACDUFF.
Well, may you see things well done there.
Adieu,


    Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!
ROSS.
Farewell, father.
OLD MAN.
God's benison go with you and with those


    That would make good of bad and friends of foes!
Exeunt.

Enter Banquo.
BANQUO.
Thou hast it now: King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,


    As the weird women promised, and I fear


    Thou play'dst most foully for't; yet it was said


    It should not stand in thy posterity,


    But that myself should be the root and father


    Of many kings.
If there come truth from them


    (As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)


    Why, by the verities on thee made good,


    May they not be my oracles as well


    And set me up in hope?
But hush, no more.
Sennet sounds.
Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Macbeth


    as Queen, Lennox, Ross, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants.
MACBETH.
Here's our chief guest.
LADY MACBETH.
If he had been forgotten,


    It had been as a gap in our great feast


    And all thing unbecoming.
MACBETH.
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,


    And I'll request your presence.
BANQUO.
Let your Highness


    Command upon me, to the which my duties


    Are with a most indissoluble tie


    Forever knit.
MACBETH.
Ride you this afternoon?
BANQUO.
Ay, my good lord.
MACBETH.
We should have else desired your good advice,


    Which still hath been both grave and prosperous


    In this day's council; but we'll take tomorrow.
Is't far you ride?
BANQUO.
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time


    'Twixt this and supper.
Go not my horse the better,


    I must become a borrower of the night


    For a dark hour or twain.
MACBETH.
Fail not our feast.
BANQUO.
My lord, I will not.
MACBETH.
We hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd


    In England and in Ireland, not confessing


    Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers


    With strange invention.
But of that tomorrow,


    When therewithal we shall have cause of state


    Craving us jointly.
Hie you to horse; adieu,


    Till you return at night.
Goes Fleance with you?
BANQUO.
Ay, my good lord.
Our time does call upon 's.
MACBETH.
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot,


    And so I do commend you to their backs.
Farewell.
Exit Banquo.
Let every man be master of his time


    Till seven at night; to make society


    The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself


    Till supper time alone.
While then, God be with you!
Exeunt all but Macbeth and an Attendant.
Sirrah, a word with you.
Attend those men


    Our pleasure?
ATTENDANT.
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
MACBETH.
Bring them before us.
Exit Attendant.
To be thus is nothing,


    But to be safely thus.
Our fears in Banquo.
Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature


    Reigns that which would be fear'd.
'Tis much he dares,


    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,


    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor


    To act in safety.
There is none but he


    Whose being I do fear; and under him


    My genius is rebuked, as it is said


    Mark Antony's was by Caesar.
He chid the sisters


    When first they put the name of King upon me


    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like


    They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown


    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,


    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,


    No son of mine succeeding.
If't be so,


    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,


    For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd,


    Put rancors in the vessel of my peace


    Only for them, and mine eternal jewel


    Given to the common enemy of man,


    To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings!
Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,


    And champion me to the utterance!
Who's there?
Re-enter Attendant, with two Murtherers.
Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
Exit Attendant.
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
FIRST MURTHERER.
It was, so please your Highness.
MACBETH.
Well then, now


    Have you consider'd of my speeches?
Know


    That it was he in the times past which held you


    So under fortune, which you thought had been


    Our innocent self?
This I made good to you


    In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you:


    How you were borne in hand, how cross'd, the instruments,


    Who wrought with them, and all things else that might


    To half a soul and to a notion crazed


    Say, "Thus did Banquo."
FIRST MURTHERER.
You made it known to us.
MACBETH.
I did so, and went further, which is now


    Our point of second meeting.
Do you find


    Your patience so predominant in your nature,


    That you can let this go?
Are you so gospel'd,


    To pray for this good man and for his issue,


    Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave


    And beggar'd yours forever?
FIRST MURTHERER.
We are men, my liege.
MACBETH.
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men,


    As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,


    Shoughs, waterrugs, and demi-wolves are clept


    All by the name of dogs.
The valued file


    Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,


    The housekeeper, the hunter, every one


    According to the gift which bounteous nature


    Hath in him closed, whereby he does receive


    Particular addition, from the bill


    That writes them all alike; and so of men.
Now if you have a station in the file,


    Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say it,


    And I will put that business in your bosoms


    Whose execution takes your enemy off,


    Grapples you to the heart and love of us,


    Who wear our health but sickly in his life,


    Which in his death were perfect.
SECOND MURTHERER.
I am one, my liege,


    Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world


    Have so incensed that I am reckless what


    I do to spite the world.
FIRST MURTHERER.
And I another


    So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,


    That I would set my life on any chance,


    To mend it or be rid on't.
MACBETH.
Both of you


    Know Banquo was your enemy.
BOTH MURTHERERS.
True, my lord.
MACBETH.
So is he mine, and in such bloody distance


    That every minute of his being thrusts


    Against my near'st of life; and though I could


    With barefaced power sweep him from my sight


    And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,


    For certain friends that are both his and mine,


    Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall


    Who I myself struck down.
And thence it is


    That I to your assistance do make love,


    Masking the business from the common eye


    For sundry weighty reasons.
SECOND MURTHERER.
We shall, my lord,


    Perform what you command us.
FIRST MURTHERER.
Though our lives-


  MACBETH.
Your spirits shine through you.
Within this hour at


most


    I will advise you where to plant yourselves,


    Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,


    The moment on't; for't must be done tonight


    And something from the palace (always thought


    That I require a clearness); and with him-


    To leave no rubs nor botches in the work-


    Fleance his son, that keeps him company,


    Whose absence is no less material to me


    Than is his father's, must embrace the fate


    Of that dark hour.
Resolve yourselves apart;


    I'll come to you anon.
BOTH MURTHERERS.
We are resolved, my lord.
MACBETH.
I'll call upon you straight.
Abide within.
Exeunt Murtherers.
It is concluded: Banquo, thy soul's flight,


    If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.
Exit.
Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant.
LADY MACBETH.
Is Banquo gone from court?
SERVANT.
Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.
LADY MACBETH.
Say to the King I would attend his leisure


    For a few words.
SERVANT.
Madam, I will.
Exit.
LADY MACBETH.
Nought's had, all's spent,


    Where our desire is got without content.
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy


    Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
Enter Macbeth.
How now, my lord?
Why do you keep alone,


    Of sorriest fancies your companions making,


    Using those thoughts which should indeed have died


    With them they think on?
Things without all remedy


    Should be without regard.
What's done is done.
MACBETH.
We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it.
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice


    Remains in danger of her former tooth.
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer,


    Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep


    In the affliction of these terrible dreams


    That shake us nightly.
Better be with the dead,


    Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,


    Than on the torture of the mind to lie


    In restless ecstasy.
Duncan is in his grave;


    After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.
Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,


    Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,


    Can touch him further.
LADY MACBETH.
Come on,


    Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;


    Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.
MACBETH.
So shall I, love, and so, I pray, be you.
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;


    Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:


    Unsafe the while, that we


    Must lave our honors in these flattering streams,


    And make our faces vizards to our hearts,


    Disguising what they are.
LADY MACBETH.
You must leave this.
MACBETH.
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.
LADY MACBETH.
But in them nature's copy's not eterne.
MACBETH.
There's comfort yet; they are assailable.
Then be thou jocund.
Ere the bat hath flown


    His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons


    The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums


    Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done


    A deed of dreadful note.
LADY MACBETH.
What's to be done?
MACBETH.
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,


    Till thou applaud the deed.
Come, seeling night,


    Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,


    And with thy bloody and invisible hand


    Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond


    Which keeps me pale!
Light thickens, and the crow


    Makes wing to the rooky wood;


    Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,


    Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
Thou marvel'st at my words, but hold thee still:


    Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
So, prithee, go with me.
Exeunt.
Enter three Murtherers.
FIRST MURTHERER.
But who did bid thee join with us?
THIRD MURTHERER.
Macbeth.
SECOND MURTHERER.
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers


    Our offices and what we have to do


    To the direction just.
FIRST MURTHERER.
Then stand with us.
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day;


    Now spurs the lated traveler apace


    To gain the timely inn, and near approaches


    The subject of our watch.
THIRD MURTHERER.
Hark!
I hear horses.
BANQUO.
[Within.]
Give us a light there, ho!
SECOND MURTHERER.
Then 'tis he; the rest


    That are within the note of expectation


    Already are i' the court.
FIRST MURTHERER.
His horses go about.
THIRD MURTHERER.
Almost a mile, but he does usually-


    So all men do -from hence to the palace gate


    Make it their walk.
SECOND MURTHERER.
A light, a light!
Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch.
THIRD MURTHERER.
'Tis he.
FIRST MURTHERER.
Stand to't.
BANQUO.
It will be rain tonight.
FIRST MURTHERER.
Let it come down.
They set upon Banquo.
BANQUO.
O, treachery!
Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thou mayst revenge.
O slave!
Dies.
Fleance escapes.
THIRD MURTHERER.
Who did strike out the light?
FIRST MURTHERER.
Wast not the way?
THIRD MURTHERER.
There's but one down; the son is fled.
SECOND MURTHERER.
We have lost


    Best half of our affair.
FIRST MURTHERER.
Well, let's away and say how much is done.
Exeunt.
Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, Lords, and Attendants.
MACBETH.
You know your own degrees; sit down.
At first


    And last the hearty welcome.
LORDS.
Thanks to your Majesty.
MACBETH.
Ourself will mingle with society


    And play the humble host.
Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time


    We will require her welcome.
LADY MACBETH.
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,


    For my heart speaks they are welcome.
Enter first Murtherer to the door.
MACBETH.
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
Both sides are even; here I'll sit i' the midst.
Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure


    The table round.
[Approaches the door.]
There's blood upon


thy


      face.
MURTHERER.
'Tis Banquo's then.
MACBETH.
'Tis better thee without than he within.
Is he dispatch'd?
MURTHERER.
My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.
MACBETH.
Thou art the best o' the cut-throats!
Yet he's good


    That did the like for Fleance.
If thou didst it,


    Thou art the nonpareil.
MURTHERER.
Most royal sir,


    Fleance is 'scaped.
MACBETH.
[Aside.]
Then comes my fit again.
I had else been


perfect,


    Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,


    As broad and general as the casing air;


    But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd, bound in


    To saucy doubts and fears -But Banquo's safe?
MURTHERER.
Ay, my good lord.
Safe in a ditch he bides,


    With twenty trenched gashes on his head,


    The least a death to nature.
MACBETH.
Thanks for that.
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled


    Hath nature that in time will venom breed,


    No teeth for the present.
Get thee gone.
Tomorrow


    We'll hear ourselves again.
Exit Murtherer.
LADY MACBETH.
My royal lord,


    You do not give the cheer.
The feast is sold


    That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis amaking,


    'Tis given with welcome.
To feed were best at home;


    From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;


    Meeting were bare without it.
MACBETH.
Sweet remembrancer!
Now good digestion wait on appetite,


    And health on both!
LENNOX.
May't please your Highness sit.
The Ghost of Banquo enters and sits in Macbeth's place.
MACBETH.
Here had we now our country's honor roof'd,


    Were the graced person of our Banquo present,


    Who may I rather challenge for unkindness


    Than pity for mischance!
ROSS.
His absence, sir,


    Lays blame upon his promise.
Please't your Highness


    To grace us with your royal company?
MACBETH.
The table's full.
LENNOX.
Here is a place reserved, sir.
MACBETH.
Where?
LENNOX.
Here, my good lord.
What is't that moves your Highness?
MACBETH.
Which of you have done this?
LORDS.
What, my good lord?
MACBETH.
Thou canst not say I did it; never shake


    Thy gory locks at me.
ROSS.
Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is not well.
LADY MACBETH.
Sit, worthy friends; my lord is often thus,


    And hath been from his youth.
Pray you, keep seat.
The fit is momentary; upon a thought


    He will again be well.
If much you note him,


    You shall offend him and extend his passion.
Feed, and regard him not-Are you a man?
MACBETH.
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that


    Which might appal the devil.
LADY MACBETH.
O proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fear;


    This is the air-drawn dagger which you said


    Led you to Duncan.
O, these flaws and starts,


    Impostors to true fear, would well become


    A woman's story at a winter's fire,


    Authorized by her grandam.
Shame itself!
Why do you make such faces?
When all's done,


    You look but on a stool.
MACBETH.
Prithee, see there!
Behold!
Look!
Lo!
How say you?
Why, what care I?
If thou canst nod, speak too.
If charnel houses and our graves must send


    Those that we bury back, our monuments


    Shall be the maws of kites.
Exit Ghost.
LADY MACBETH.
What, quite unmann'd in folly?
MACBETH.
If I stand here, I saw him.
LADY MACBETH.
Fie, for shame!
MACBETH.
Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,


    Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal;


    Ay, and since too, murthers have been perform'd


    Too terrible for the ear.
The time has been,


    That, when the brains were out, the man would die,


    And there an end; but now they rise again,


    With twenty mortal murthers on their crowns,


    And push us from our stools.
This is more strange


    Than such a murther is.
LADY MACBETH.
My worthy lord,


    Your noble friends do lack you.
MACBETH.
I do forget.
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing


    To those that know me.
Come, love and health to all;


    Then I'll sit down.
Give me some wine, fill full.
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,


    And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.
Would he were here!
To all and him we thirst,


    And all to all.
LORDS.
Our duties and the pledge.
Re-enter Ghost.
MACBETH.
Avaunt, and quit my sight!
Let the earth hide thee!
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;


    Thou hast no speculation in those eyes


    Which thou dost glare with.
LADY MACBETH.
Think of this, good peers,


    But as a thing of custom.
'Tis no other,


    Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.
MACBETH.
What man dare, I dare.
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,


    The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;


    Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves


    Shall never tremble.
Or be alive again,


    And dare me to the desert with thy sword.
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me


    The baby of a girl.
Hence, horrible shadow!
Unreal mockery, hence!
Exit Ghost.
Why, so, being gone,


    I am a man again.
Pray you sit still.
LADY MACBETH.
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good


meeting,


    With most admired disorder.
MACBETH.
Can such things be,


    And overcome us like a summer's cloud,


    Without our special wonder?
You make me strange


    Even to the disposition that I owe


    When now I think you can behold such sights


    And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks


    When mine is blanch'd with fear.
ROSS.
What sights, my lord?
LADY MACBETH.
I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;


    Question enrages him.
At once, good night.
Stand not upon the order of your going,


    But go at once.
LENNOX.
Good night, and better health


    Attend his Majesty!
LADY MACBETH.
A kind good night to all!
Exeunt all but Macbeth and Lady Macbeth.
MACBETH.
It will have blood; they say blood will have blood.
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;


    Augures and understood relations have


    By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth


    The secret'st man of blood.
What is the night?
LADY MACBETH.
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
MACBETH.
How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person


    At our great bidding?
LADY MACBETH.
Did you send to him, sir?
MACBETH.
I hear it by the way, but I will send.
There's not a one of them but in his house


    I keep a servant feed.
I will tomorrow,


    And betimes I will, to the weird sisters.
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,


    By the worst means, the worst.
For mine own good


    All causes shall give way.
I am in blood


    Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,


    Returning were as tedious as go o'er.
Strange things I have in head that will to hand,


    Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.
LADY MACBETH.
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
MACBETH.
Come, we'll to sleep.
My strange and self-abuse


    Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.
We are yet but young in deed.
Exeunt.
Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecate.
FIRST WITCH.
Why, how now, Hecate?
You look angerly.
HECATE.
Have I not reason, beldams as you are,


    Saucy and overbold?
How did you dare


    To trade and traffic with Macbeth


    In riddles and affairs of death,


    And I, the mistress of your charms,


    The close contriver of all harms,


    Was never call'd to bear my part,


    Or show the glory of our art?
And, which is worse, all you have done


    Hath been but for a wayward son,


    Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,


    Loves for his own ends, not for you.
But make amends now.
Get you gone,


    And at the pit of Acheron


    Meet me i' the morning.
Thither he


    Will come to know his destiny.
Your vessels and your spells provide,


    Your charms and everything beside.
I am for the air; this night I'll spend


    Unto a dismal and a fatal end.
Great business must be wrought ere noon:


    Upon the corner of the moon


    There hangs a vaporous drop profound;


    I'll catch it ere it come to ground.
And that distill'd by magic sleights


    Shall raise such artificial sprites


    As by the strength of their illusion


    Shall draw him on to his confusion.
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear


    His hopes 'bove wisdom, grace, and fear.
And you all know security


    Is mortals' chiefest enemy.
Music and a song within,


                                         "Come away, come away."
Hark!
I am call'd; my little spirit, see,


    Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.
Exit.
FIRST WITCH.
Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.
Exeunt.
Enter Lennox and another Lord.
LENNOX.
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,


    Which can interpret farther; only I say


    Thing's have been strangely borne.
The gracious Duncan


    Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead.
And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,


    Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,


    For Fleance fled.
Men must not walk too late.
Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous


    It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain


    To kill their gracious father?
Damned fact!
How it did grieve Macbeth!
Did he not straight,


    In pious rage, the two delinquents tear


    That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Was not that nobly done?
Ay, and wisely too,


    For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive


    To hear the men deny't.
So that, I say,


    He has borne all things well; and I do think


    That, had he Duncan's sons under his key-


    As, an't please heaven, he shall not -they should find


    What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
But, peace!
For from broad words, and 'cause he fail'd


    His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear,


    Macduff lives in disgrace.
Sir, can you tell


    Where he bestows himself?
LORD.
The son of Duncan,


    From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,


    Lives in the English court and is received


    Of the most pious Edward with such grace


    That the malevolence of fortune nothing


    Takes from his high respect.
Thither Macduff


    Is gone to pray the holy King, upon his aid


    To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward;


    That by the help of these, with Him above


    To ratify the work, we may again


    Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,


    Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,


    Do faithful homage, and receive free honors-


    All which we pine for now.
And this report


    Hath so exasperate the King that he


    Prepares for some attempt of war.
LENNOX.
Sent he to Macduff?
LORD.
He did, and with an absolute "Sir, not I,"


    The cloudy messenger turns me his back,


    And hums, as who should say, "You'll rue the time


    That clogs me with this answer."
LENNOX.
And that well might


    Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance


    His wisdom can provide.
Some holy angel


    Fly to the court of England and unfold


    His message ere he come, that a swift blessing


    May soon return to this our suffering country


    Under a hand accursed!
LORD.
I'll send my prayers with him.
Exeunt.

Enter the three Witches.
FIRST WITCH.
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.
SECOND WITCH.
Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.
THIRD WITCH.
Harpier cries, "'Tis time, 'tis time."
FIRST WITCH.
Round about the cauldron go;


    In the poison'd entrails throw.
Toad, that under cold stone


    Days and nights has thirty-one


    Swelter'd venom sleeping got,


    Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.
ALL.
Double, double, toil and trouble;


    Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
SECOND WITCH.
Fillet of a fenny snake,


    In the cauldron boil and bake;


    Eye of newt and toe of frog,


    Wool of bat and tongue of dog,


    Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,


    Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,


    For a charm of powerful trouble,


    Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
ALL.
Double, double, toil and trouble;


    Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
THIRD WITCH.
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,


    Witch's mummy, maw and gulf


    Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,


    Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,


    Liver of blaspheming Jew,


    Gall of goat and slips of yew


    Sliver'd in the moon's eclipse,


    Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,


    Finger of birth-strangled babe


    Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,


    Make the gruel thick and slab.
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,


    For the ingredients of our cauldron.
ALL.
Double, double, toil and trouble;


    Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
SECOND WITCH.
Cool it with a baboon's blood,


    Then the charm is firm and good.
Enter Hecate to the other three Witches.
HECATE.
O, well done!
I commend your pains,


    And everyone shall share i' the gains.
And now about the cauldron sing,


    Like elves and fairies in a ring,


    Enchanting all that you put in.
Music and a song, "Black spirits."
Hecate retires.
SECOND WITCH.
By the pricking of my thumbs,


    Something wicked this way comes.
Open, locks,


    Whoever knocks!
Enter Macbeth.
MACBETH.
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?
What is't you do?
ALL.
A deed without a name.
MACBETH.
I conjure you, by that which you profess


    (Howeer you come to know it) answer me:


    Though you untie the winds and let them fight


    Against the churches, though the yesty waves


    Confound and swallow navigation up,


    Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down,


    Though castles topple on their warders' heads,


    Though palaces and pyramids do slope


    Their heads to their foundations, though the treasure


    Of nature's germaines tumble all together


    Even till destruction sicken, answer me


    To what I ask you.
FIRST WITCH.
Speak.
SECOND WITCH.
Demand.
THIRD WITCH.
We'll answer.
FIRST WITCH.
Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,


    Or from our masters'?
MACBETH.
Call 'em, let me see 'em.
FIRST WITCH.
Pour in sow's blood that hath eaten


    Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten


    From the murtherer's gibbet throw


    Into the flame.
ALL.
Come, high or low;


    Thyself and office deftly show!
Thunder.
First Apparition: an armed Head.
MACBETH.
Tell me, thou unknown power-


  FIRST WITCH.
He knows thy thought:


    Hear his speech, but say thou nought.
FIRST APPARITION.
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Beware Macduff,


    Beware the Thane of Fife.
Dismiss me.
Enough.
Descends.
MACBETH.
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;


    Thou hast harp'd my fear aright.
But one word more-


  FIRST WITCH.
He will not be commanded.
Here's another,


    More potent than the first.
Thunder.
Second Apparition: a bloody Child.
SECOND APPARITION.
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
MACBETH.
Had I three ears, I'd hear thee.
SECOND APPARITION.
Be bloody, bold, and resolute: laugh to


scorn


    The power of man, for none of woman born


    Shall harm Macbeth.
Descends.
MACBETH.
Then live, Macduff.
What need I fear of thee?
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,


    And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live,


    That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,


    And sleep in spite of thunder.
Thunder.
Third Apparition: a Child crowned,


               with a tree in his hand.
What is this,


    That rises like the issue of a king,


    And wears upon his baby brow the round


    And top of sovereignty?
ALL.
Listen, but speak not to't.
THIRD APPARITION.
Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care


    Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until


    Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill


    Shall come against him.
Descends.
MACBETH.
That will never be.
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree


    Unfix his earth-bound root?
Sweet bodements, good!
Rebellion's head, rise never till the Wood


    Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth


    Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath


    To time and mortal custom.
Yet my heart


    Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art


    Can tell so much, shall Banquo's issue ever


    Reign in this kingdom?
ALL.
Seek to know no more.
MACBETH.
I will be satisfied!
Deny me this,


    And an eternal curse fall on you!
Let me know.
Why sinks that cauldron, and what noise is this?
Hautboys.
FIRST WITCH.
Show!
SECOND WITCH.
Show!
THIRD.
WITCH.
Show!
ALL.
Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;


    Come like shadows, so depart!
A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;


                   Banquo's Ghost following.
MACBETH.
Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo; down!
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs.
And thy hair,


    Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
A third is like the former.
Filthy hags!
Why do you show me this?
A fourth!
Start, eyes!
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
Another yet!
A seventh!
I'll see no more!
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass


    Which shows me many more; and some I see


    That twofold balls and treble sceptres carry.
Horrible sight!
Now I see 'tis true;


    For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,


    And points at them for his.
What, is this so?
FIRST WITCH.
Ay, sir, all this is so.
But why


    Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
Come,sisters, cheer we up his sprites,


    And show the best of our delights.
I'll charm the air to give a sound,


    While you perform your antic round,


    That this great King may kindly say


    Our duties did his welcome pay.
Music.
The Witches dance and


                                        then vanish with Hecate.
MACBETH.
Where are they?
Gone?
Let this pernicious hour


    Stand ay accursed in the calendar!
Come in, without there!
Enter Lennox.
LENNOX.
What's your Grace's will?
MACBETH.
Saw you the weird sisters?
LENNOX.
No, my lord.
MACBETH.
Came they not by you?
LENNOX.
No indeed, my lord.
MACBETH.
Infected be the air whereon they ride,


    And damn'd all those that trust them!
I did hear


    The galloping of horse.
Who wast came by?
LENNOX.
'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word


    Macduff is fled to England.
MACBETH.
Fled to England?
LENNOX.
Ay, my good lord.
MACBETH.
[Aside.]
Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits.
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook


    Unless the deed go with it.
From this moment


    The very firstlings of my heart shall be


    The firstlings of my hand.
And even now,


    To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:


    The castle of Macduff I will surprise,


    Seize upon Fife, give to the edge o' the sword


    His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls


    That trace him in his line.
No boasting like a fool;


    This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
But no more sights!
-Where are these gentlemen?
Come, bring me where they are.
Exeunt.
Enter Lady Macduff, her Son, and Ross.
LADY MACDUFF.
What had he done, to make him fly the land?
ROSS.
You must have patience, madam.
LADY MACDUFF.
He had none;


    His flight was madness.
When our actions do not,


    Our fears do make us traitors.
ROSS.
You know not


    Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
LADY MACDUFF.
Wisdom?
To leave his wife, to leave his babes,


    His mansion, and his titles, in a place


    From whence himself does fly?
He loves us not;


    He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,


    The most diminutive of birds, will fight,


    Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
All is the fear and nothing is the love;


    As little is the wisdom, where the flight


    So runs against all reason.
ROSS.
My dearest coz,


    I pray you, school yourself.
But for your husband,


    He is noble, wise, Judicious, and best knows


    The fits o' the season.
I dare not speak much further;


    But cruel are the times when we are traitors


    And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor


    From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,


    But float upon a wild and violent sea


    Each way and move.
I take my leave of you;


    Shall not be long but I'll be here again.
Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward


    To what they were before.
My pretty cousin,


    Blessing upon you!
LADY MACDUFF.
Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.
ROSS.
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,


    It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.
I take my leave at once.
Exit.
LADY MACDUFF.
Sirrah, your father's dead.
And what will you do now?
How will you live?
SON.
As birds do, Mother.
LADY MACDUFF.
What, with worms and flies?
SON.
With what I get, I mean; and so do they.
LADY MACDUFF.
Poor bird!
Thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,


    The pitfall nor the gin.
SON.
Why should I, Mother?
Poor birds they are not set for.
My father is not dead, for all your saying.
LADY MACDUFF.
Yes, he is dead.
How wilt thou do for father?
SON.
Nay, how will you do for a husband?
LADY MACDUFF.
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
SON.
Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.
LADY MACDUFF.
Thou speak'st with all thy wit, and yet, i'


faith,


    With wit enough for thee.
SON.
Was my father a traitor, Mother?
LADY MACDUFF.
Ay, that he was.
SON.
What is a traitor?
LADY MACDUFF.
Why one that swears and lies.
SON.
And be all traitors that do so?
LADY MACDUFF.
Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be


     hanged.
SON.
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
LADY MACDUFF.
Everyone.
SON.
Who must hang them?
LADY MACDUFF.
Why, the honest men.
SON.
Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars


and


    swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them.
LADY MACDUFF.
Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
But how wilt


thou do


    for a father?
SON.
If he were dead, you'ld weep for him; if you would not, it


    were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.
LADY MACDUFF.
Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!
Enter a Messenger.
MESSENGER.
Bless you, fair dame!
I am not to you known,


    Though in your state of honor I am perfect.
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.
If you will take a homely man's advice,


    Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
To fright you thus, methinks I am too savage;


    To do worse to you were fell cruelty,


    Which is too nigh your person.
Heaven preserve you!
I dare abide no longer.
Exit.
LADY MACDUFF.
Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm.
But I remember now


    I am in this earthly world, where to do harm


    Is often laudable, to do good sometime


    Accounted dangerous folly.
Why then, alas,


    Do I put up that womanly defense,


    To say I have done no harm -What are these faces?
Enter Murtherers.
FIRST MURTHERER.
Where is your husband?
LADY MACDUFF.
I hope, in no place so unsanctified


    Where such as thou mayst find him.
FIRST MURTHERER.
He's a traitor.
SON.
Thou liest, thou shag-ear'd villain!
FIRST MURTHERER.
What, you egg!
Stabs him.
Young fry of treachery!
SON.
He has kill'd me, Mother.
Run away, I pray you!
Dies.
Exit Lady Macduff, crying "Murther!"
Exeunt Murtherers, following her.
Enter Malcolm and Macduff.
MALCOLM.
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there


    Weep our sad bosoms empty.
MACDUFF.
Let us rather


    Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men


    Bestride our downfall'n birthdom.
Each new morn


    New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows


    Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds


    As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out


    Like syllable of dolor.
MALCOLM.
What I believe, I'll wail;


    What know, believe; and what I can redress,


    As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,


    Was once thought honest.
You have loved him well;


    He hath not touch'd you yet.
I am young, but something


    You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom


    To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb


    To appease an angry god.
MACDUFF.
I am not treacherous.
MALCOLM.
But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil


    In an imperial charge.
But I shall crave your pardon;


    That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,


    Yet grace must still look so.
MACDUFF.
I have lost my hopes.
MALCOLM.
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,


    Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,


    Without leave-taking?
I pray you,


    Let not my jealousies be your dishonors,


    But mine own safeties.
You may be rightly just,


    Whatever I shall think.
MACDUFF.
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,


    For goodness dare not check thee.
Wear thou thy wrongs;


    The title is affeer'd.
Fare thee well, lord.
I would not be the villain that thou think'st


    For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp


    And the rich East to boot.
MALCOLM.
Be not offended;


    I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;


    It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash


    Is added to her wounds.
I think withal


    There would be hands uplifted in my right;


    And here from gracious England have I offer


    Of goodly thousands.
But for all this,


    When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,


    Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country


    Shall have more vices than it had before,


    More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,


    By him that shall succeed.
MACDUFF.
What should he be?
MALCOLM.
It is myself I mean, in whom I know


    All the particulars of vice so grafted


    That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth


    Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state


    Esteem him as a lamb, being compared


    With my confineless harms.
MACDUFF.
Not in the legions


    Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd


    In evils to top Macbeth.
MALCOLM.
I grant him bloody,


    Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,


    Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin


    That has a name.
But there's no bottom, none,


    In my voluptuousness.
Your wives, your daughters,


    Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up


    The cestern of my lust, and my desire


    All continent impediments would o'erbear


    That did oppose my will.
Better Macbeth


    Than such an one to reign.
MACDUFF.
Boundless intemperance


    In nature is a tyranny; it hath been


    The untimely emptying of the happy throne,


    And fall of many kings.
But fear not yet


    To take upon you what is yours.
You may


    Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty


    And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
We have willing dames enough; there cannot be


    That vulture in you to devour so many


    As will to greatness dedicate themselves,


    Finding it so inclined.
MALCOLM.
With this there grows


    In my most ill-composed affection such


    A stanchless avarice that, were I King,


    I should cut off the nobles for their lands,


    Desire his jewels and this other's house,


    And my more-having would be as a sauce


    To make me hunger more, that I should forge


    Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,


    Destroying them for wealth.
MACDUFF.
This avarice


    Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root


    Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been


    The sword of our slain kings.
Yet do not fear;


    Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will


    Of your mere own.
All these are portable,


    With other graces weigh'd.
MALCOLM.
But I have none.
The king-becoming graces,


    As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,


    Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,


    Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,


    I have no relish of them, but abound


    In the division of each several crime,


    Acting it many ways.
Nay, had I power, I should


    Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,


    Uproar the universal peace, confound


    All unity on earth.
MACDUFF.
O Scotland, Scotland!
MALCOLM.
If such a one be fit to govern, speak.
I am as I have spoken.
MACDUFF.
Fit to govern?
No, not to live.
O nation miserable!
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,


    When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,


    Since that the truest issue of thy throne


    By his own interdiction stands accursed


    And does blaspheme his breed?
Thy royal father


    Was a most sainted king; the queen that bore thee,


    Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,


    Died every day she lived.
Fare thee well!
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself


    Have banish'd me from Scotland.
O my breast,


    Thy hope ends here!
MALCOLM.
Macduff, this noble passion,


    Child of integrity, hath from my soul


    Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts


    To thy good truth and honor.
Devilish Macbeth


    By many of these trains hath sought to win me


    Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me


    From over-credulous haste.
But God above


    Deal between thee and me!
For even now


    I put myself to thy direction and


    Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure


    The taints and blames I laid upon myself,


    For strangers to my nature.
I am yet


    Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,


    Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,


    At no time broke my faith, would not betray


    The devil to his fellow, and delight


    No less in truth than life.
My first false speaking


    Was this upon myself.
What I am truly


    Is thine and my poor country's to command.
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,


    Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men


    Already at a point, was setting forth.
Now we'll together, and the chance of goodness


    Be like our warranted quarrel!
Why are you silent?
MACDUFF.
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once


    'Tis hard to reconcile.
Enter a Doctor.
MALCOLM.
Well, more anon.
Comes the King forth, I pray you?
DOCTOR.
Ay, sir, there are a crew of wretched souls


    That stay his cure.
Their malady convinces


    The great assay of art, but at his touch,


    Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand,


    They presently amend.
MALCOLM.
I thank you, Doctor.
Exit Doctor.
MACDUFF.
What's the disease he means?
MALCOLM.
'Tis call'd the evil:


    A most miraculous work in this good King,


    Which often, since my here-remain in England,


    I have seen him do.
How he solicits heaven,


    Himself best knows; but strangely-visited people,


    All swol'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,


    The mere despair of surgery, he cures,


    Hanging a golden stamp about their necks


    Put on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken,


    To the succeeding royalty he leaves


    The healing benediction.
With this strange virtue


    He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,


    And sundry blessings hang about his throne


    That speak him full of grace.
Enter Ross.
MACDUFF.
See, who comes here?
MALCOLM.
My countryman, but yet I know him not.
MACDUFF.
My ever gentle cousin, welcome hither.
MALCOLM.
I know him now.
Good God, betimes remove


    The means that makes us strangers!
ROSS.
Sir, amen.
MACDUFF.
Stands Scotland where it did?
ROSS.
Alas, poor country,


    Almost afraid to know itself!
It cannot


    Be call'd our mother, but our grave.
Where nothing,


    But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;


    Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air,


    Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems


    A modern ecstasy.
The dead man's knell


    Is there scarce ask'd for who, and good men's lives


    Expire before the flowers in their caps,


    Dying or ere they sicken.
MACDUFF.
O, relation


    Too nice, and yet too true!
MALCOLM.
What's the newest grief?
ROSS.
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker;


    Each minute teems a new one.
MACDUFF.
How does my wife?
ROSS.
Why, well.
MACDUFF.
And all my children?
ROSS.
Well too.
MACDUFF.
The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
ROSS.
No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
MACDUFF.
Be not a niggard of your speech.
How goest?
ROSS.
When I came hither to transport the tidings,


    Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor


    Of many worthy fellows that were out,


    Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,


    For that I saw the tyrant's power afoot.
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland


    Would create soldiers, make our women fight,


    To doff their dire distresses.
MALCOLM.
Be't their comfort


    We are coming thither.
Gracious England hath


    Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;


    An older and a better soldier none


    That Christendom gives out.
ROSS.
Would I could answer


    This comfort with the like!
But I have words


    That would be howl'd out in the desert air,


    Where hearing should not latch them.
MACDUFF.
What concern they?
The general cause?
Or is it a fee-grief


    Due to some single breast?
ROSS.
No mind that's honest


    But in it shares some woe, though the main part


    Pertains to you alone.
MACDUFF.
If it be mine,


    Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.
ROSS.
Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,


    Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound


    That ever yet they heard.
MACDUFF.
Humh!
I guess at it.
ROSS.
Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes


    Savagely slaughter'd.
To relate the manner


    Were, on the quarry of these murther'd deer,


    To add the death of you.
MALCOLM.
Merciful heaven!
What, man!
Neer pull your hat upon your brows;


    Give sorrow words.
The grief that does not speak


    Whispers the o'erfraught heart, and bids it break.
MACDUFF.
My children too?
ROSS.
Wife, children, servants, all


    That could be found.
MACDUFF.
And I must be from thence!
My wife kill'd too?
ROSS.
I have said.
MALCOLM.
Be comforted.
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,


    To cure this deadly grief.
MACDUFF.
He has no children.
All my pretty ones?
Did you say all?
O hell-kite!
All?
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam


    At one fell swoop?
MALCOLM.
Dispute it like a man.
MACDUFF.
I shall do so,


    But I must also feel it as a man.
I cannot but remember such things were


    That were most precious to me.
Did heaven look on,


    And would not take their part?
Sinful Macduff,


    They were all struck for thee!
Naught that I am,


    Not for their own demerits, but for mine,


    Fell slaughter on their souls.
Heaven rest them now!
MALCOLM.
Be this the whetstone of your sword.
Let grief


    Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.
MACDUFF.
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes


    And braggart with my tongue!
But, gentle heavens,


    Cut short all intermission; front to front


    Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;


    Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,


    Heaven forgive him too!
MALCOLM.
This tune goes manly.
Come, go we to the King; our power is ready,


    Our lack is nothing but our leave.
Macbeth


    Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above


    Put on their instruments.
Receive what cheer you may,


    The night is long that never finds the day.
Exeunt.

Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting Gentlewoman.
DOCTOR.
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no


    truth in your report.
When was it she last walked?
GENTLEWOMAN.
Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen


her


    rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her


    closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it,


    afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this


while


    in a most fast sleep.
DOCTOR.
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the


    benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching!
In this


slumbery


    agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances,


    what, at any time, have you heard her say?
GENTLEWOMAN.
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
DOCTOR.
You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should.
GENTLEWOMAN.
Neither to you nor anyone, having no witness to


    confirm my speech.
Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.
Lo you, here she comes!
This is her very guise, and, upon my


    life, fast asleep.
Observe her; stand close.
DOCTOR.
How came she by that light?
GENTLEWOMAN.
Why, it stood by her.
She has light by her


     continually; 'tis her command.
DOCTOR.
You see, her eyes are open.
GENTLEWOMAN.
Ay, but their sense is shut.
DOCTOR.
What is it she does now?
Look how she rubs her hands.
GENTLEWOMAN.
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus


    washing her hands.
I have known her continue in this a


quarter of


    an hour.
LADY MACBETH.
Yet here's a spot.
DOCTOR.
Hark, she speaks!
I will set down what comes from her,


to


    satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
LADY MACBETH.
Out, damned spot!
Out, I say!
One- two -why then


'tis


    time to do't.
Hell is murky.
Fie, my lord, fie!
A soldier,


and


    afeard?
What need we fear who knows it, when none can call


our


    power to account?
Yet who would have thought the old man to


have


    had so much blood in him?
DOCTOR.
Do you mark that?
LADY MACBETH.
The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now?
What,


    will these hands neer be clean?
No more o' that, my lord, no


more


    o' that.
You mar all with this starting.
DOCTOR.
Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.
GENTLEWOMAN.
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of


that.
Heaven knows what she has known.
LADY MACBETH.
Here's the smell of the blood still.
All the


perfumes


    of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
Oh, oh, oh!
DOCTOR.
What a sigh is there!
The heart is sorely charged.
GENTLEWOMAN.
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the


    dignity of the whole body.
DOCTOR.
Well, well, well-


  GENTLEWOMAN.
Pray God it be, sir.
DOCTOR.
This disease is beyond my practice.
Yet I have known


those


    which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in


their


    beds.
LADY MACBETH.
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown, look not


so


    pale.
I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come


out


    on's grave.
DOCTOR.
Even so?
LADY MACBETH.
To bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate.
Come,


    come, come, come, give me your hand.What's done cannot be


undone.
To bed, to bed, to bed.
Exit.
DOCTOR.
Will she go now to bed?
GENTLEWOMAN.
Directly.
DOCTOR.
Foul whisperings are abroad.
Unnatural deeds


    Do breed unnatural troubles; infected minds


    To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God, forgive us all!
Look after her;


    Remove from her the means of all annoyance,


    And still keep eyes upon her.
So good night.
My mind she has mated and amazed my sight.
I think, but dare not speak.
GENTLEWOMAN.
Good night, good doctor.
Exeunt.
Enter Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, and Soldiers.
MENTEITH.
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,


    His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes


    Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm


    Excite the mortified man.
ANGUS.
Near Birnam Wood


    Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.
CAITHNESS.
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
LENNOX.
For certain, sir, he is not; I have a file


    Of all the gentry.
There is Seward's son


    And many unrough youths that even now


    Protest their first of manhood.
MENTEITH.
What does the tyrant?
CAITHNESS.
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
Some say he's mad; others, that lesser hate him,


    Do call it valiant fury; but, for certain,


    He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause


    Within the belt of rule.
ANGUS.
Now does he feel


    His secret murthers sticking on his hands,


    Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;


    Those he commands move only in command,


    Nothing in love.
Now does he feel his title


    Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe


    Upon a dwarfish thief.
MENTEITH.
Who then shall blame


    His pester'd senses to recoil and start,


    When all that is within him does condemn


    Itself for being there?
CAITHNESS.
Well, march we on


    To give obedience where 'tis truly owed.
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,


    And with him pour we, in our country's purge,


    Each drop of us.
LENNOX.
Or so much as it needs


    To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
Make we our march towards Birnam.
Exeunt marching.
Enter Macbeth, Doctor, and Attendants.
MACBETH.
Bring me no more reports; let them fly all!
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane


    I cannot taint with fear.
What's the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman?
The spirits that know


    All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:


    "Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman


    Shall e'er have power upon thee."
Then fly, false Thanes,


    And mingle with the English epicures!
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear


    Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
Enter a Servant.
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
Where got'st thou that goose look?
SERVANT.
There is ten thousand-


  MACBETH.
Geese, villain?
SERVANT.
Soldiers, sir.
MACBETH.
Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,


    Thou lily-liver'd boy.
What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy soul!
Those linen cheeks of thine


    Are counselors to fear.
What soldiers, whey-face?
SERVANT.
The English force, so please you.
MACBETH.
Take thy face hence.
Exit Servant.
Seyton-I am sick at heart,


    When I behold- Seyton, I say!- This push


    Will chair me ever or disseat me now.
I have lived long enough.
My way of life


    Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf,


    And that which should accompany old age,


    As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,


    I must not look to have; but in their stead,


    Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath,


    Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not.
Seyton!
Enter Seyton.
SEYTON.
What's your gracious pleasure?
MACBETH.
What news more?
SEYTON.
All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.
MACBETH.
I'll fight, 'til from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
Give me my armor.
SEYTON.
'Tis not needed yet.
MACBETH.
I'll put it on.
Send out more horses, skirr the country round,


    Hang those that talk of fear.
Give me mine armor.
How does your patient, doctor?
DOCTOR.
Not so sick, my lord,


    As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,


    That keep her from her rest.
MACBETH.
Cure her of that.
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,


    Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,


    Raze out the written troubles of the brain,


    And with some sweet oblivious antidote


    Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff


    Which weighs upon the heart?
DOCTOR.
Therein the patient


    Must minister to himself.
MACBETH.
Throw physic to the dogs, I'll none of it.
Come, put mine armor on; give me my staff.
Seyton, send out.
Doctor, the Thanes fly from me.
Come, sir, dispatch.
If thou couldst, doctor, cast


    The water of my land, find her disease


    And purge it to a sound and pristine health,


    I would applaud thee to the very echo,


    That should applaud again.
Pull't off, I say.
What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug


    Would scour these English hence?
Hearst thou of them?
DOCTOR.
Ay, my good lord, your royal preparation


    Makes us hear something.
MACBETH.
Bring it after me.
I will not be afraid of death and bane


    Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.
DOCTOR.
[Aside.]
Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,


    Profit again should hardly draw me here.
Exeunt.
Enter Malcolm, old Seward and his Son, Macduff, Menteith,


Caithness,


Angus, Lennox, Ross, and Soldiers, marching.
MALCOLM.
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand


    That chambers will be safe.
MENTEITH.
We doubt it nothing.
SIWARD.
What wood is this before us?
MENTEITH.
The Wood of Birnam.
MALCOLM.
Let every soldier hew him down a bough,


    And bear't before him; thereby shall we shadow


    The numbers of our host, and make discovery


    Err in report of us.
SOLDIERS.
It shall be done.
SIWARD.
We learn no other but the confident tyrant


    Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure


    Our setting down before't.
MALCOLM.
'Tis his main hope;


    For where there is advantage to be given,


    Both more and less have given him the revolt,


    And none serve with him but constrained things


    Whose hearts are absent too.
MACDUFF.
Let our just censures


    Attend the true event, and put we on


    Industrious soldiership.
SIWARD.
The time approaches


    That will with due decision make us know


    What we shall say we have and what we owe.
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,


    But certain issue strokes must arbitrate.
Towards which advance the war.
Exeunt marching.
Enter Macbeth, Seyton, and Soldiers, with drum and colors.
MACBETH.
Hang out our banners on the outward walls;


    The cry is still, "They come!"
Our castle's strength


    Will laugh a siege to scorn.
Here let them lie


    Till famine and the ague eat them up.
Were they not forced with those that should be ours,


    We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,


    And beat them backward home.
A cry of women within.
What is that noise?
SEYTON.
It is the cry of women, my good lord.
Exit.
MACBETH.
I have almost forgot the taste of fears:


    The time has been, my senses would have cool'd


    To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair


    Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir


    As life were in't.
I have supp'd full with horrors;


    Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,


    Cannot once start me.
Re-enter Seyton.
Wherefore was that cry?
SEYTON.
The Queen, my lord, is dead.
MACBETH.
She should have died hereafter;


    There would have been a time for such a word.
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow


    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day


    To the last syllable of recorded time;


    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools


    The way to dusty death.
Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player


    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage


    And then is heard no more.
It is a tale


    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,


    Signifying nothing.
Enter a Messenger.
Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.
MESSENGER.
Gracious my lord,


    I should report that which I say I saw,


    But know not how to do it.
MACBETH.
Well, say, sir.
MESSENGER.
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,


    I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,


    The Wood began to move.
MACBETH.
Liar and slave!
MESSENGER.
Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so.
Within this three mile may you see it coming;


    I say, a moving grove.
MACBETH.
If thou speak'st false,


    Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,


    Till famine cling thee; if thy speech be sooth,


    I care not if thou dost for me as much.
I pull in resolution and begin


    To doubt the equivocation of the fiend


    That lies like truth.
"Fear not, till Birnam Wood


    Do come to Dunsinane," and now a wood


    Comes toward Dunsinane.
Arm, arm, and out!
If this which he avouches does appear,


    There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
I 'gin to be aweary of the sun


    And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
Ring the alarum bell!
Blow, wind!
Come, wrack!
At least we'll die with harness on our back.
Exeunt.
Enter Malcolm, old Siward, Macduff, and their Army, with boughs.
Drum and colors.
MALCOLM.
Now near enough; your leavy screens throw down,


    And show like those you are.
You, worthy uncle,


    Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,


    Lead our first battle.
Worthy Macduff and we


    Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,


    According to our order.
SIWARD.
Fare you well.
Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight,


    Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
MACDUFF.
Make all our trumpets speak, give them all breath,


    Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
Exeunt.
Enter Macbeth.
MACBETH.
They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,


    But bear-like I must fight the course.
What's he


    That was not born of woman?
Such a one


    Am I to fear, or none.
Enter young Siward.
YOUNG SIWARD.
What is thy name?
MACBETH.
Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
YOUNG SIWARD.
No, though thou call'st thyself a hotter name


    Than any is in hell.
MACBETH.
My name's Macbeth.
YOUNG SIWARD.
The devil himself could not pronounce a title


    More hateful to mine ear.
MACBETH.
No, nor more fearful.
YOUNG SIWARD.
Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword


    I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
They fight, and young Seward is slain.
MACBETH.
Thou wast born of woman.
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,


    Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.
Exit.
Alarums.
Enter Macduff.
MACDUFF.
That way the noise is.
Tyrant, show thy face!
If thou best slain and with no stroke of mine,


    My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms


    Are hired to bear their staves.
Either thou, Macbeth,


    Or else my sword, with an unbatter'd edge,


    I sheathe again undeeded.
There thou shouldst be;


    By this great clatter, one of greatest note


    Seems bruited.
Let me find him, Fortune!
And more I beg not.
Exit.
Alarums.
Enter Malcolm and old Siward.
SIWARD.
This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd.
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight,


    The noble Thanes do bravely in the war,


    The day almost itself professes yours,


    And little is to do.
MALCOLM.
We have met with foes


    That strike beside us.
SIWARD.
Enter, sir, the castle.
Exeunt.
Alarum.
Enter Macbeth.
MACBETH.
Why should I play the Roman fool and die


    On mine own sword?
Whiles I see lives, the gashes


    Do better upon them.
Enter Macduff.
MACDUFF.
Turn, hell hound, turn!
MACBETH.
Of all men else I have avoided thee.
But get thee back, my soul is too much charged


    With blood of thine already.
MACDUFF.
I have no words.
My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain


    Than terms can give thee out!
They fight.
MACBETH.
Thou losest labor.
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air


    With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;


    I bear a charmed life, which must not yield


    To one of woman born.
MACDUFF.
Despair thy charm,


    And let the angel whom thou still hast served


    Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb


    Untimely ripp'd.
MACBETH.
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,


    For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
And be these juggling fiends no more believed


    That patter with us in a double sense,


    That keep the word of promise to our ear


    And break it to our hope.
I'll not fight with thee.
MACDUFF.
Then yield thee, coward,


    And live to be the show and gaze o' the time.
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,


    Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,


    "Here may you see the tyrant."
MACBETH.
I will not yield,


    To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,


    And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane,


    And thou opposed, being of no woman born,


    Yet I will try the last.
Before my body


    I throw my warlike shield!
Lay on, Macduff,


    And damn'd be him that first cries, "Hold, enough!"
Exeunt fighting.
Alarums.
Retreat.
Flourish.
Enter, with drum and colors, Malcolm, old
Siward, Ross,
the other Thanes, and Soldiers.
MALCOLM.
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
SIWARD.
Some must go off, and yet, by these I see,


    So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
MALCOLM.
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.
ROSS.
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt.
He only lived but till he was a man,


    The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd


    In the unshrinking station where he fought,


    But like a man he died.
SIWARD.
Then he is dead?
ROSS.
Ay, and brought off the field.
Your cause of sorrow


    Must not be measured by his worth, for then


    It hath no end.
SIWARD.
Had he his hurts before?
ROSS.
Ay, on the front.
SIWARD.
Why then, God's soldier be he!
Had I as many sons as I have hairs,


    I would not wish them to a fairer death.
And so his knell is knoll'd.
MALCOLM.
He's worth more sorrow,


    And that I'll spend for him.
SIWARD.
He's worth no more:


    They say he parted well and paid his score,


    And so God be with him!
Here comes newer comfort.
Re-enter Macduff, with Macbeth's head.
MACDUFF.
Hail, King, for so thou art.
Behold where stands


    The usurper's cursed head.
The time is free.
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl


    That speak my salutation in their minds,


    Whose voices I desire aloud with mine-


    Hail, King of Scotland!
ALL.
Hail, King of Scotland!
Flourish.
