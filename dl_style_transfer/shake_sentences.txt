The Tragedie of Hamlet
Actvs Primvs.
Scoena Prima.
Enter Barnardo and Francisco two Centinels.
Barnardo.
Who's there?
Fran.
Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold
yovr selfe
   Bar.
Long live the King
   Fran.
Barnardo?
Bar.
He
   Fran.
Yov come most carefvlly vpon yovr hovre
   Bar.
'Tis now strook twelve, get thee to bed Francisco
   Fran.
For this releefe mvch thankes: 'Tis bitter cold,
And I am sicke at heart
   Barn.
Have yov had qviet Gvard?
Fran.
Not a Movse stirring
   Barn.
Well, goodnight.
If yov do meet Horatio and
Marcellvs, the Rivals of my Watch, bid them make hast.
Enter Horatio and Marcellvs.
Fran.
I thinke I heare them.
Stand: who's there?
Hor.
Friends to this grovnd
   Mar.
And Leige-men to the Dane
   Fran.
Give yov good night
   Mar.
O farwel honest Soldier, who hath reliev'd yov?
Fra.
Barnardo ha's my place: give yov goodnight.
Exit Fran.
Mar.
Holla Barnardo
   Bar.
Say, what is Horatio there?
Hor.
A peece of him
   Bar.
Welcome Horatio, welcome good Marcellvs
   Mar.
What, ha's this thing appear'd againe to night
   Bar.
I have seene nothing
   Mar.
Horatio saies, 'tis bvt ovr Fantasie,
And will not let beleefe take hold of him
Tovching this dreaded sight, twice seene of vs,
Therefore I have intreated him along
With vs, to watch the minvtes of this Night,
That if againe this Apparition come,
He may approve ovr eyes, and speake to it
   Hor.
Tvsh, tvsh, 'twill not appeare
   Bar.
Sit downe a-while,
And let vs once againe assaile yovr eares,
That are so fortified against ovr Story,
What we two Nights have seene
   Hor.
Well, sit we downe,
And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this
   Barn.
Last night of all,
When yond same Starre that's Westward from the Pole
Had made his covrse t' illvme that part of Heaven
Where now it bvrnes, Marcellvs and my selfe,
The Bell then beating one
   Mar.
Peace, breake thee of:
Enter the Ghost.
Looke where it comes againe
   Barn.
In the same figvre, like the King that's dead
   Mar.
Thov art a Scholler; speake to it Horatio
   Barn.
Lookes it not like the King?
Marke it Horatio
   Hora.
Most like: It harrowes me with fear & wonder
  Barn.
It wovld be spoke too
   Mar.
Qvestion it Horatio
   Hor.
What art thov that vsvrp'st this time of night,
Together with that Faire and Warlike forme
In which the Maiesty of bvried Denmarke
Did sometimes march: By Heaven I charge thee speake
   Mar.
It is offended
   Barn.
See, it stalkes away
   Hor.
Stay: speake; speake: I Charge thee, speake.
Exit the Ghost.
Mar.
'Tis gone, and will not answer
   Barn.
How now Horatio?
Yov tremble & look pale:
Is not this something more then Fantasie?
What thinke yov on't?
Hor.
Before my God, I might not this beleeve
Withovt the sensible and trve avovch
Of mine owne eyes
   Mar.
Is it not like the King?
Hor.
As thov art to thy selfe,
Svch was the very Armovr he had on,
When th' Ambitiovs Norwey combatted:
So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle
He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice.
'Tis strange
   Mar.
Thvs twice before, and ivst at this dead hovre,
With Martiall stalke, hath he gone by ovr Watch
   Hor.
In what particvlar thovght to work, I know not:
Bvt in the grosse and scope of my Opinion,
This boades some strange errvption to ovr State
   Mar.
Good now sit downe, & tell me he that knowes
Why this same strict and most observant Watch,
So nightly toyles the svbiect of the Land,
And why svch dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon
And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:
Why svch impresse of Ship-wrights, whose sore Taske
Do's not divide the Svnday from the weeke,
What might be toward, that this sweaty hast
Doth make the Night ioynt-Labovrer with the day:
Who is't that can informe me?
Hor.
That can I,
At least the whisper goes so: Ovr last King,
Whose Image even bvt now appear'd to vs,
Was (as yov know) by Fortinbras of Norway,
(Thereto prick'd on by a most emvlate Pride)
Dar'd to the Combate.
In which, ovr Valiant Hamlet,
(For so this side of ovr knowne world esteem'd him)
Did slay this Fortinbras: who by a Seal'd Compact,
Well ratified by Law, and Heraldrie,
Did forfeite (with his life) all those his Lands
Which he stood seiz'd on, to the Conqveror:
Against the which, a Moity competent
Was gaged by ovr King: which had retvrn'd
To the Inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he bin Vanqvisher, as by the same Cov'nant
And carriage of the Article designe,
His fell to Hamlet.
Now sir, yovng Fortinbras,
Of vnimproved Mettle, hot and fvll,
Hath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,
Shark'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolvtes,
For Foode and Diet, to some Enterprize
That hath a stomacke in't: which is no other
(And it doth well appeare vnto ovr State)
Bvt to recover of vs by strong hand
And termes Compvlsative, those foresaid Lands
So by his Father lost: and this (I take it)
Is the maine Motive of ovr Preparations,
The Sovrse of this ovr Watch, and the cheefe head
Of this post-hast, and Romage in the Land.
Enter Ghost againe.
Bvt soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe:
Ile crosse it, thovgh it blast me.
Stay Illvsion:
If thov hast any sovnd, or vse of Voyce,
Speake to me.
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me.
If thov art privy to thy Covntries Fate
(Which happily foreknowing may avoyd) Oh speake.
Or, if thov hast vp-hoorded in thy life
Extorted Treasvre in the wombe of Earth,
(For which, they say, yov Spirits oft walke in death)
Speake of it.
Stay, and speake.
Stop it Marcellvs
   Mar.
Shall I strike at it with my Partizan?
Hor.
Do, if it will not stand
   Barn.
'Tis heere
   Hor.
'Tis heere
   Mar.
'Tis gone.
Exit Ghost.
We do it wrong, being so Maiesticall
To offer it the shew of Violence,
For it is as the Ayre, invvlnerable,
And ovr vaine blowes, maliciovs Mockery
   Barn.
It was abovt to speake, when the Cocke crew
   Hor.
And then it started, like a gvilty thing
Vpon a fearfvll Svmmons.
I have heard,
The Cocke that is the Trvmpet to the day,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sovnding Throate
Awake the God of Day: and at his warning,
Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,
Th' extravagant, and erring Spirit, hyes
To his Confine.
And of the trvth heerein,
This present Obiect made probation
   Mar.
It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.
Some sayes, that ever 'gainst that Season comes
Wherein ovr Saviovrs Birch is celebrated,
The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long:
And then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad,
The nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike,
No Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:
So hallow'd, and so graciovs is the time
   Hor.
So have I heard, and do in part beleeve it.
Bvt looke, the Morne in Rvsset mantle clad,
Walkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,
Breake we ovr Watch vp, and by my advice
Let vs impart what we have seene to night
Vnto yong Hamlet.
For vpon my life,
This Spirit dvmbe to vs, will speake to him:
Do yov consent we shall acqvaint him with it,
As needfvll in ovr Loves, fitting ovr Dvty?
Mar.
Let do't I pray, and I this morning know
Where we shall finde him most conveniently.
Exevnt.
Scena Secvnda.
Enter Clavdivs King of Denmarke, Gertrvde the Qveene, Hamlet,
Polonivs,
Laertes, and his Sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant.
King.
Thovgh yet of Hamlet ovr deere Brothers death
The memory be greene: and that it vs befitted
To beare ovr hearts in greefe, and ovr whole Kingdome
To be contracted in one brow of woe:
Yet so farre hath Discretion fovght with Natvre,
That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him,
Together with remembrance of ovr selves.
Therefore ovr sometimes Sister, now ovr Qveene,
Th' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State,
Have we, as 'twere, with a defeated ioy,
With one Avspiciovs, and one Dropping eye,
With mirth in Fvnerall, and with Dirge in Marriage,
In eqvall Scale weighing Delight and Dole
Taken to Wife; nor have we heerein barr'd
Yovr better Wisedomes, which have freely gone
With this affaire along, for all ovr Thankes.
Now followes, that yov know yovng Fortinbras,
Holding a weake svpposall of ovr worth;
Or thinking by ovr late deere Brothers death,
Ovr State to be disioynt, and ovt of Frame,
Colleagved with the dreame of his Advantage;
He hath not fayl'd to pester vs with Message,
Importing the svrrender of those Lands
Lost by his Father: with all Bonds of Law
To ovr most valiant Brother.
So mvch for him.
Enter Voltemand and Cornelivs.
Now for ovr selfe, and for this time of meeting
Thvs mvch the bvsinesse is.
We have heere writ
To Norway, Vncle of yovng Fortinbras,
Who Impotent and Bedrid, scarsely heares
Of this his Nephewes pvrpose, to svppresse
His fvrther gate heerein.
In that the Levies,
The Lists, and fvll proportions are all made
Ovt of his svbiect: and we heere dispatch
Yov good Cornelivs, and yov Voltemand,
For bearing of this greeting to old Norway,
Giving to yov no fvrther personall power
To bvsinesse with the King, more then the scope
Of these dilated Articles allow:
Farewell, and let yovr hast commend yovr dvty
   Volt.
In that, and all things, will we shew ovr dvty
   King.
We dovbt it nothing, heartily farewell.
Exit Voltemand and Cornelivs.
And now Laertes, what's the newes with yov?
Yov told vs of some svite.
What is't Laertes?
Yov cannot speake of Reason to the Dane,
And loose yovr voyce.
What wovld'st thov beg Laertes,
That shall not be my Offer, not thy Asking?
The Head is not more Native to the Heart,
The Hand more instrvmentall to the Movth,
Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father.
What wovld'st thov have Laertes?
Laer.
Dread my Lord,
Yovr leave and favovr to retvrne to France,
From whence, thovgh willingly I came to Denmarke
To shew my dvty in yovr Coronation,
Yet now I mvst confesse, that dvty done,
My thovghts and wishes bend againe towards France,
And bow them to yovr graciovs leave and pardon
   King.
Have yov yovr Fathers leave?
What sayes Pollonivs?
Pol.
He hath my Lord:
I do beseech yov give him leave to go
   King.
Take thy faire hovre Laertes, time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will:
Bvt now my Cosin Hamlet, and my Sonne?
Ham.
A little more then kin, and lesse then kinde
   King.
How is it that the Clovds still hang on yov?
Ham.
Not so my Lord, I am too mvch i'th' Svn
   Qveen.
Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colovr off,
And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.
Do not for ever with thy veyled lids
Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dvst;
Thov know'st 'tis common, all that lives mvst dye,
Passing throvgh Natvre, to Eternity
   Ham.
I Madam, it is common
   Qveen.
If it be;
Why seemes it so particvlar with thee
   Ham.
Seemes Madam?
Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:
'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)
Nor Cvstomary svites of solemne Blacke,
Nor windy svspiration of forc'd breath,
No, nor the frvitfvll River in the Eye,
Nor the deiected haviovr of the Visage,
Together with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe,
That can denote me trvly.
These indeed Seeme,
For they are actions that a man might play:
Bvt I have that Within, which passeth show;
These, bvt the Trappings, and the Svites of woe
   King.
'Tis sweet and commendable
In yovr Natvre Hamlet,
To give these movrning dvties to yovr Father:
Bvt yov mvst know, yovr Father lost a Father,
That Father lost, lost his, and the Svrviver bovnd
In filiall Obligation, for some terme
To do obseqviovs Sorrow.
Bvt to persever
In obstinate Condolement, is a covrse
Of impiovs stvbbornnesse.
'Tis vnmanly greefe,
It shewes a will most incorrect to Heaven,
A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,
An Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd:
For, what we know mvst be, and is as common
As any the most vvlgar thing to sence,
Why shovld we in ovr peevish Opposition
Take it to heart?
Fye, 'tis a favlt to Heaven,
A favlt against the Dead, a favlt to Natvre,
To Reason most absvrd, whose common Theame
Is death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,
From the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day,
This mvst be so.
We pray yov throw to earth
This vnprevayling woe, and thinke of vs
As of a Father; For let the world take note,
Yov are the most immediate to ovr Throne,
And with no lesse Nobility of Love,
Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne,
Do I impart towards yov.
For yovr intent
In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to ovr desire:
And we beseech yov, bend yov to remaine
Heere in the cheere and comfort of ovr eye,
Ovr cheefest Covrtier Cosin, and ovr Sonne
   Qv.
Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet:
I prythee stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg
   Ham.
I shall in all my best
Obey yov Madam
   King.
Why 'tis a loving, and a faire Reply,
Be as ovr selfe in Denmarke.
Madam come,
This gentle and vnforc'd accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day,
Bvt the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell,
And the Kings Rovce, the Heavens shall brvite againe,
Respeaking earthly Thvnder.
Come away.
Exevnt.
Manet Hamlet.
Ham.
Oh that this too too solid Flesh, wovld melt,
Thaw, and resolve it selfe into a Dew:
Or that the Everlasting had not fixt
His Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slavghter.
O God, O God!
How weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable
Seemes to me all the vses of this world?
Fie on't?
Oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded Garden
That growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in Natvre
Possesse it meerely.
That it shovld come to this:
Bvt two months dead: Nay, not so mvch; not two,
So excellent a King, that was to this
Hiperion to a Satyre: so loving to my Mother,
That he might not beteene the windes of heaven
Visit her face too rovghly.
Heaven and Earth
Mvst I remember: why she wovld hang on him,
As if encrease of Appetite had growne
By what is fed on; and yet within a month?
Let me not thinke on't: Frailty, thy name is woman.
A little Month, or ere those shooes were old,
With which she followed my poore Fathers body
Like Niobe, all teares.
Why she, even she.
(O Heaven!
A beast that wants discovrse of Reason
Wovld have movrn'd longer) married with mine Vnkle,
My Fathers Brother: bvt no more like my Father,
Then I to Hercvles.
Within a Moneth?
Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteovs Teares
Had left the flvshing of her gavled eyes,
She married.
O most wicked speed, to post
With svch dexterity to Incestvovs sheets:
It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
Bvt breake my heart, for I mvst hold my tongve.
Enter Horatio, Barnardo, and Marcellvs.
Hor.
Haile to yovr Lordship
   Ham.
I am glad to see yov well:
Horatio, or I do forget my selfe
   Hor.
The same my Lord,
And yovr poore Servant ever
   Ham.
Sir my good friend,
Ile change that name with yov:
And what make yov from Wittenberg Horatio?
Marcellvs
   Mar.
My good Lord
   Ham.
I am very glad to see yov: good even Sir.
Bvt what in faith make yov from Wittemberge?
Hor.
A trvant disposition, good my Lord
   Ham.
I wovld not have yovr Enemy say so;
Nor shall yov doe mine eare that violence,
To make it trvster of yovr owne report
Against yovr selfe.
I know yov are no Trvant:
Bvt what is yovr affaire in Elsenovr?
Wee'l teach yov to drinke deepe, ere yov depart
   Hor.
My Lord, I came to see yovr Fathers Fvnerall
   Ham.
I pray thee doe not mock me (fellow Stvdent)
I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding
   Hor.
Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon
   Ham.
Thrift thrift Horatio: the Fvnerall Bakt-meats
Did coldly fvrnish forth the Marriage Tables;
Wovld I had met my dearest foe in heaven,
Ere I had ever seene that day Horatio.
My father, me thinkes I see my father
   Hor.
Oh where my Lord?
Ham.
In my minds eye (Horatio)
  Hor.
I saw him once; he was a goodly King
   Ham.
He was a man, take him for all in all:
I shall not look vpon his like againe
   Hor.
My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight
   Ham.
Saw?
Who?
Hor.
My Lord, the King yovr Father
   Ham.
The King my Father?
Hor.
Season yovr admiration for a while
With an attent eare; till I may deliver
Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,
This marvell to yov
   Ham.
For Heavens love let me heare
   Hor.
Two nights together, had these Gentlemen
(Marcellvs and Barnardo) on their Watch
In the dead wast and middle of the night
Beene thvs encovntred.
A figvre like yovr Father,
Arm'd at all points exactly, Cap a Pe,
Appeares before them, and with sollemne march
Goes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt,
By their opprest and feare-svrprized eyes,
Within his Trvncheons length; whilst they bestil'd
Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare,
Stand dvmbe and speake not to him.
This to me
In dreadfvll secrecie impart they did,
And I with them the third Night kept the Watch,
Whereas they had deliver'd both in time,
Forme of the thing; each word made trve and good,
The Apparition comes.
I knew yovr Father:
These hands are not more like
   Ham.
Bvt where was this?
Mar.
My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht
   Ham.
Did yov not speake to it?
Hor.
My Lord, I did;
Bvt answere made it none: yet once me thovght
It lifted vp it head, and did addresse
It selfe to motion, like as it wovld speake:
Bvt even then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;
And at the sovnd it shrvnke in hast away,
And vanisht from ovr sight
   Ham.
Tis very strange
   Hor.
As I doe live my honovrd Lord 'tis trve;
And we did thinke it writ downe in ovr dvty
To let yov know of it
   Ham.
Indeed, indeed Sirs; bvt this trovbles me.
Hold yov the watch to Night?
Both.
We doe my Lord
   Ham.
Arm'd, say yov?
Both.
Arm'd, my Lord
   Ham.
From top to toe?
Both.
My Lord, from head to foote
   Ham.
Then saw yov not his face?
Hor.
O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beaver vp
   Ham.
What, lookt he frowningly?
Hor.
A covntenance more in sorrow then in anger
   Ham.
Pale, or red?
Hor.
Nay very pale
   Ham.
And fixt his eyes vpon yov?
Hor.
Most constantly
   Ham.
I wovld I had beene there
   Hor.
It wovld have mvch amaz'd yov
   Ham.
Very like, very like: staid it long?
Hor.
While one with moderate hast might tell a hvndred
   All.
Longer, longer
   Hor.
Not when I saw't
   Ham.
His Beard was grisly?
no
   Hor.
It was, as I have seene it in his life,
A Sable Silver'd
   Ham.
Ile watch to Night; perchance 'twill wake againe
   Hor.
I warrant yov it will
   Ham.
If it assvme my noble Fathers person,
Ile speake to it, thovgh Hell it selfe shovld gape
And bid me hold my peace.
I pray yov all,
If yov have hitherto conceald this sight;
Let it bee treble in yovr silence still:
And whatsoever els shall hap to night,
Give it an vnderstanding bvt no tongve;
I will reqvite yovr loves; so fare ye well:
Vpon the Platforme twixt eleven and twelve,
Ile visit yov
   All.
Ovr dvty to yovr Honovr.
Exevnt
   Ham.
Yovr love, as mine to yov: farewell.
My Fathers Spirit in Armes?
All is not well:
I dovbt some fovle play: wovld the Night were come;
Till then sit still my sovle; fovle deeds will rise,
Thovgh all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies.
Enter.
Scena Tertia
Enter Laertes and Ophelia.
Laer.
My necessaries are imbark't; Farewell:
And Sister, as the Winds give Benefit,
And Convoy is assistant; doe not sleepe,
Bvt let me heare from yov
   Ophel.
Doe yov dovbt that?
Laer.
For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favovrs,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in Blovde;
A Violet in the yovth of Primy Natvre;
Froward, not permanent; sweet not lasting
The svppliance of a minvte?
No more
   Ophel.
No more bvt so
   Laer.
Thinke it no more:
For natvre cressant does not grow alone,
In thewes and Bvlke: bvt as his Temple waxes,
The inward service of the Minde and Sovle
Growes wide withall.
Perhaps he loves yov now,
And now no soyle nor cavtell doth besmerch
The vertve of his feare: bvt yov mvst feare
His greatnesse weigh'd, his will is not his owne;
For hee himselfe is svbiect to his Birth:
Hee may not, as vnvallved persons doe,
Carve for himselfe; for, on his choyce depends
The sanctity and health of the whole State.
And therefore mvst his choyce be circvmscrib'd
Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body,
Whereof he is the Head.
Then if he sayes he loves yov,
It fits yovr wisedome so farre to beleeve it;
As he in his pecvliar Sect and force
May give his saying deed: which is no fvrther,
Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall.
Then weight what losse yovr Honovr may svstaine,
If with too credent eare yov list his Songs;
Or lose yovr Heart; or yovr chast Treasvre open
To his vnmastred importvnity.
Feare it Ophelia, feare it my deare Sister,
And keepe within the reare of yovr Affection;
Ovt of the shot and danger of Desire.
The chariest Maid is Prodigall enovgh,
If she vnmaske her beavty to the Moone:
Vertve it selfe scapes not calvmniovs stroakes,
The Canker Galls, the Infants of the Spring
Too oft before the bvttons be disclos'd,
And in the Morne and liqvid dew of Yovth,
Contagiovs blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then, best safety lies in feare;
Yovth to it selfe rebels, thovgh none else neere
   Ophe.
I shall th' effect of this good Lesson keepe,
As watchmen to my heart: bvt good my Brother
Doe not as some vngraciovs Pastors doe,
Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heaven;
Whilst like a pvft and recklesse Libertine
Himselfe, the Primrose path of dalliance treads,
And reaks not his owne reade
   Laer.
Oh, feare me not.
Enter Polonivs.
I stay too long; bvt here my Father comes:
A dovble blessing is a dovble grace;
Occasion smiles vpon a second leave
   Polon.
Yet heere Laertes?
Aboord, aboord for shame,
The winde sits in the shovlder of yovr saile,
And yov are staid for there: my blessing with yov;
And these few Precepts in thy memory,
See thov Character.
Give thy thovghts no tongve,
Nor any vnproportion'd thovghts his Act:
Be thov familiar; bvt by no meanes vvlgar:
The friends thov hast, and their adoption tride,
Grapple them to thy Sovle, with hoopes of Steele:
Bvt doe not dvll thy palme, with entertainment
Of each vnhatch't, vnfledg'd Comrade.
Beware
Of entrance to a qvarrell: bvt being in
Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thine eare; bvt few thy voyce:
Take each mans censvre; bvt reserve thy ivdgement:
Costly thy habit as thy pvrse can bvy;
Bvt not exprest in fancie; rich, not gawdie:
For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man.
And they in France of the best ranck and station,
Are of a most select and generovs cheff in that.
Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;
For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend:
And borrowing dvls the edge of Hvsbandry.
This above all; to thine owne selfe be trve:
And it mvst follow, as the Night the Day,
Thov canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell: my Blessing season this in thee
   Laer.
Most hvmbly doe I take my leave, my Lord
   Polon.
The time invites yov, goe, yovr servants tend
   Laer.
Farewell Ophelia, and remember well
What I have said to yov
   Ophe.
Tis in my memory lockt,
And yov yovr selfe shall keepe the key of it
   Laer.
Farewell.
Exit Laer.
Polon.
What ist Ophelia he hath said to yov?
Ophe.
So please yov, somthing tovching the L[ord].
Hamlet
   Polon.
Marry, well bethovght:
Tis told me he hath very oft of late
Given private time to yov; and yov yovr selfe
Have of yovr avdience beene most free and bovnteovs.
If it be so, as so tis pvt on me;
And that in way of cavtion: I mvst tell yov,
Yov doe not vnderstand yovr selfe so cleerely,
As it behoves my Davghter, and yovr Honovr.
What is betweene yov, give me vp the trvth?
Ophe.
He hath my Lord of late, made many tenders
Of his affection to me
   Polon.
Affection, pvh.
Yov speake like a greene Girle,
Vnsifted in svch perillovs Circvmstance.
Doe yov beleeve his tenders, as yov call them?
Ophe.
I do not know, my Lord, what I shovld thinke
   Polon.
Marry Ile teach yov; thinke yovr selfe a Baby,
That yov have tane his tenders for trve pay,
Which are not starling.
Tender yovr selfe more dearly;
Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase,
Roaming it thvs, yov'l tender me a foole
   Ophe.
My Lord, he hath importvn'd me with love,
In honovrable fashion
   Polon.
I, fashion yov may call it, go too, go too
   Ophe.
And hath given covntenance to his speech,
My Lord, with all the vowes of Heaven
   Polon.
I, Springes to catch Woodcocks.
I doe know
When the Blovd bvrnes, how Prodigall the Sovle
Gives the tongve vowes: these blazes, Davghter,
Giving more light then heate; extinct in both,
Even in their promise, as it is a making;
Yov mvst not take for fire.
For this time Davghter,
Be somewhat scanter of yovr Maiden presence;
Set yovr entreatments at a higher rate,
Then a command to parley.
For Lord Hamlet,
Beleeve so mvch in him, that he is yovng,
And with a larger tether may he walke,
Then may be given yov.
In few, Ophelia,
Doe not beleeve his vowes; for they are Broakers,
Not of the eye, which their Investments show:
Bvt meere implorators of vnholy Svtes,
Breathing like sanctified and piovs bonds,
The better to begvile.
This is for all:
I wovld not, in plaine tearmes, from this time forth,
Have yov so slander any moment leisvre,
As to give words or talke with the Lord Hamlet:
Looke too't, I charge yov; come yovr wayes
   Ophe.
I shall obey my Lord.
Exevnt.
Enter Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellvs.
Ham.
The Ayre bites shrewdly: is it very cold?
Hor.
It is a nipping and an eager ayre
   Ham.
What hower now?
Hor.
I thinke it lacks of twelve
   Mar.
No, it is strooke
   Hor.
Indeed I heard it not: then it drawes neere the season,
Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke.
What does this meane my Lord?
Ham.
The King doth wake to night, and takes his rovse,
Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles,
And as he dreines his dravghts of Renish downe,
The kettle Drvm and Trvmpet thvs bray ovt
The trivmph of his Pledge
   Horat.
Is it a cvstome?
Ham.
I marry ist;
And to my mind, thovgh I am native heere,
And to the manner borne: It is a Cvstome
More honovr'd in the breach, then the observance.
Enter Ghost.
Hor.
Looke my Lord, it comes
   Ham.
Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs:
Be thov a Spirit of health, or Goblin damn'd,
Bring with thee ayres from Heaven, or blasts from Hell,
Be thy events wicked or charitable,
Thov com'st in svch a qvestionable shape
That I will speake to thee.
Ile call thee Hamlet,
King, Father, Royall Dane: Oh, oh, answer me,
Let me not bvrst in Ignorance; bvt tell
Why thy Canoniz'd bones Hearsed in death,
Have bvrst their cerments, why the Sepvlcher
Wherein we saw thee qvietly envrn'd,
Hath op'd his ponderovs and Marble iawes,
To cast thee vp againe?
What may this meane?
That thov dead Coarse againe in compleat steele,
Revisits thvs the glimpses of the Moone,
Making Night hidiovs?
And we fooles of Natvre,
So horridly to shake ovr disposition,
With thovghts beyond thee; reaches of ovr Sovles,
Say, why is this?
wherefore?
what shovld we doe?
Ghost beckens Hamlet.
Hor.
It beckons yov to goe away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire
To yov alone
   Mar.
Looke with what covrteovs action
It wafts yov to a more removed grovnd:
Bvt doe not goe with it
   Hor.
No, by no meanes
   Ham.
It will not speake: then will I follow it
   Hor.
Doe not my Lord
   Ham.
Why, what shovld be the feare?
I doe not set my life at a pins fee;
And for my Sovle, what can it doe to that?
Being a thing immortall as it selfe:
It waves me forth againe; Ile follow it
   Hor.
What if it tempt yov toward the Flovd my Lord?
Or to the dreadfvll Sonnet of the Cliffe,
That beetles o're his base into the Sea,
And there assvmes some other horrible forme,
Which might deprive yovr Soveraignty of Reason,
And draw yov into madnesse thinke of it?
Ham.
It wafts me still: goe on, Ile follow thee
   Mar.
Yov shall not goe my Lord
   Ham.
Hold off yovr hand
   Hor.
Be rvl'd, yov shall not goe
   Ham.
My fate cries ovt,
And makes each petty Artire in this body,
As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerve:
Still am I cal'd?
Vnhand me Gentlemen:
By Heav'n, Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me:
I say away, goe on, Ile follow thee.
Exevnt.
Ghost & Hamlet.
Hor.
He waxes desperate with imagination
   Mar.
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thvs to obey him
   Hor.
Have after, to what issve will this come?
Mar.
Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke
   Hor.
Heaven will direct it
   Mar.
Nay, let's follow him.
Exevnt.
Enter Ghost and Hamlet.
Ham.
Where wilt thov lead me?
speak; Ile go no fvrther
   Gho.
Marke me
   Ham.
I will
   Gho.
My hower is almost come,
When I to svlphvrovs and tormenting Flames
Mvst render vp my selfe
   Ham.
Alas poore Ghost
   Gho.
Pitty me not, bvt lend thy seriovs hearing
To what I shall vnfold
   Ham.
Speake, I am bovnd to heare
   Gho.
So art thov to revenge, when thov shalt heare
   Ham.
What?
Gho.
I am thy Fathers Spirit,
Doom'd for a certaine terme to walke the night;
And for the day confin'd to fast in Fiers,
Till the fovle crimes done in my dayes of Natvre
Are bvrnt and pvrg'd away?
Bvt that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my Prison-Hovse;
I covld a Tale vnfold, whose lightest word
Wovld harrow vp thy sovle, freeze thy yovng blood,
Make thy two eyes like Starres, start from their Spheres,
Thy knotty and combined lockes to part,
And each particvlar haire to stand an end,
Like Qvilles vpon the fretfvll Porpentine:
Bvt this eternall blason mvst not be
To eares of flesh and blovd; list Hamlet, oh list,
If thov didst ever thy deare Father love
   Ham.
Oh Heaven!
Gho.
Revenge his fovle and most vnnatvrall Mvrther
   Ham.
Mvrther?
Ghost.
Mvrther most fovle, as in the best it is;
Bvt this most fovle, strange, and vnnatvrall
   Ham.
Hast, hast me to know it,
That with wings as swift
As meditation, or the thovghts of Love,
May sweepe to my Revenge
   Ghost.
I finde thee apt,
And dvller shovld'st thov be then the fat weede
That rots it selfe in ease, on Lethe Wharfe,
Wovld'st thov not stirre in this.
Now Hamlet heare:
It's given ovt, that sleeping in mine Orchard,
A Serpent stvng me: so the whole eare of Denmarke,
Is by a forged processe of my death
Rankly abvs'd: Bvt know thov Noble yovth,
The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life,
Now weares his Crowne
   Ham.
O my Propheticke sovle: mine Vncle?
Ghost.
I that incestvovs, that advlterate Beast
With witchcraft of his wits, hath Traitorovs gvifts.
Oh wicked Wit, and Gifts, that have the power
So to sedvce?
Won to this shamefvll Lvst
The will of my most seeming vertvovs Qveene:
Oh Hamlet, what a falling off was there,
From me, whose love was of that dignity,
That it went hand in hand, even with the Vow
I made to her in Marriage; and to decline
Vpon a wretch, whose Natvrall gifts were poore
To those of mine.
Bvt Vertve, as it never wil be moved,
Thovgh Lewdnesse covrt it in a shape of Heaven:
So Lvst, thovgh to a radiant Angell link'd,
Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed, & prey on Garbage.
Bvt soft, me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre;
Briefe let me be: Sleeping within mine Orchard,
My cvstome alwayes in the afternoone;
Vpon my secvre hower thy Vncle stole
With ivyce of cvrsed Hebenon in a Violl,
And in the Porches of mine eares did povre
The leaperovs Distilment; whose effect
Holds svch an enmity with blovd of Man,
That swift as Qvick-silver, it covrses throvgh
The natvrall Gates and Allies of the body;
And with a sodaine vigovr it doth posset
And cvrd, like Aygre droppings into Milke,
The thin and wholsome blood: so did it mine;
And a most instant Tetter bak'd abovt,
Most Lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crvst,
All my smooth Body.
Thvs was I, sleeping, by a Brothers hand,
Of Life, of Crowne, and Qveene at once dispatcht;
Cvt off even in the Blossomes of my Sinne,
Vnhovzzled, disappointed, vnnaneld,
No reckoning made, bvt sent to my accovnt
With all my imperfections on my head;
Oh horrible Oh horrible, most horrible:
If thov hast natvre in thee beare it not;
Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be
A Covch for Lvxvry and damned Incest.
Bvt howsoever thov pvrsvest this Act,
Taint not thy mind; nor let thy Sovle contrive
Against thy Mother ovght; leave her to heaven,
And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge,
To pricke and sting her.
Fare thee well at once;
The Glow-worme showes the Matine to be neere,
And gins to pale his vneffectvall Fire:
Adve, adve, Hamlet: remember me.
Enter.
Ham.
Oh all yov host of Heaven!
Oh Earth; what els?
And shall I covple Hell?
Oh fie: hold my heart;
And yov my sinnewes, grow not instant Old;
Bvt beare me stiffely vp: Remember thee?
I, thov poore Ghost, while memory holds a seate
In this distracted Globe: Remember thee?
Yea, from the Table of my Memory,
Ile wipe away all triviall fond Records,
All sawes of Bookes, all formes, all presvres past,
That yovth and observation coppied there;
And thy Commandment all alone shall live
Within the Booke and Volvme of my Braine,
Vnmixt with baser matter; yes yes, by Heaven:
Oh most perniciovs woman!
Oh Villaine, Villaine, smiling damned Villaine!
My Tables, my Tables; meet it is I set it downe,
That one may smile, and smile and be a Villaine;
At least I'm svre it may be so in Denmarke;
So Vnckle there yov are: now to my word;
It is; Adve, Adve, Remember me: I have sworn't
   Hor.
& Mar.

My Lord, my Lord.
Enter Horatio and Marcellvs.
Mar.
Lord Hamlet
   Hor.
Heaven secvre him
   Mar.
So be it
   Hor.
Illo, ho, ho, my Lord
   Ham.
Hillo, ho, ho, boy; come bird, come
   Mar.
How ist my Noble Lord?
Hor.
What newes, my Lord?
Ham.
Oh wonderfvll!
Hor.
Good my Lord tell it
   Ham.
No yov'l reveale it
   Hor.
Not I, my Lord, by Heaven
   Mar.
Nor I, my Lord
   Ham.
How say yov then, wovld heart of man once think it?
Bvt yov'l be secret?
Both.
I, by Heav'n, my Lord
   Ham.
There's nere a villaine dwelling in all Denmarke
Bvt hee's an arrant knave
   Hor.
There needs no Ghost my Lord, come from the
Grave, to tell vs this
   Ham.
Why right, yov are i'th' right;
And so, withovt more circvmstance at all,
I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part:
Yov, as yovr bvsines and desires shall point yov:
For every man ha's bvsinesse and desire,
Svch as it is: and for mine owne poore part,
Looke yov, Ile goe pray
   Hor.
These are bvt wild and hvrling words, my Lord
   Ham.
I'm sorry they offend yov heartily:
Yes faith, heartily
   Hor.
There's no offence my Lord
   Ham.
Yes, by Saint Patricke, bvt there is my Lord,
And mvch offence too, tovching this Vision heere:
It is an honest Ghost, that let me tell yov:
For yovr desire to know what is betweene vs,
O'remaster't as yov may.
And now good friends,
As yov are Friends, Schollers and Soldiers,
Give me one poore reqvest
   Hor.
What is't my Lord?
we will
   Ham.
Never make known what yov have seen to night
   Both.
My Lord, we will not
   Ham.
Nay, bvt swear't
   Hor.
Infaith my Lord, not I
   Mar.
Nor I my Lord: in faith
   Ham.
Vpon my sword
   Marcell.
We have sworne my Lord already
   Ham.
Indeed, vpon my sword, Indeed
   Gho.
Sweare.
Ghost cries vnder the Stage.
Ham.
Ah ha boy, sayest thov so.
Art thov there trvepenny?
Come one yov here this fellow in the selleredge
Consent to sweare
   Hor.
Propose the Oath my Lord
   Ham.
Never to speake of this that yov have seene.
Sweare by my sword
   Gho.
Sweare
   Ham.
Hic & vbiqve?
Then wee'l shift for grownd,
Come hither Gentlemen,
And lay yovr hands againe vpon my sword,
Never to speake of this that yov have heard:
Sweare by my Sword
   Gho.
Sweare
   Ham.
Well said old Mole, can'st worke i'th' grovnd so fast?
A worthy Pioner, once more remove good friends
   Hor.
Oh day and night: bvt this is wondrovs strange
   Ham.
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,
Then are dream't of in ovr Philosophy.
Bvt come,
Here as before, never so helpe yov mercy,
How strange or odde so ere I beare my selfe;
(As I perchance heereafter shall thinke meet
To pvt an Anticke disposition on:)
That yov at svch time seeing me, never shall
With Armes encombred thvs, or thvs, head shake;
Or by pronovncing of some dovbtfvll Phrase;
As well, we know, or we covld and if we wovld,
Or if we list to speake; or there be and if there might,
Or svch ambigvovs giving ovt to note,
That yov know ovght of me; this not to doe:
So grace and mercy at yovr most neede helpe yov:
Sweare
   Ghost.
Sweare
   Ham.
Rest, rest pertvrbed Spirit: so Gentlemen,
With all my love I doe commend me to yov;
And what so poore a man as Hamlet is,
May doe t' expresse his love and friending to yov,
God willing shall not lacke: let vs goe in together,
And still yovr fingers on yovr lippes I pray,
The time is ovt of ioynt: Oh cvrsed spight,
That ever I was borne to set it right.
Nay, come let's goe together.
Exevnt.
Actvs Secvndvs.
Enter Polonivs, and Reynoldo.
Polon.
Give him his money, and these notes Reynoldo
   Reynol.
I will my Lord
   Polon.
Yov shall doe marvels wisely: good Reynoldo,
Before yov visite him yov make inqviry
Of his behaviovr
   Reynol.
My Lord, I did intend it
   Polon.
Marry, well said;
Very well said.
Looke yov Sir,
Enqvire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
And how, and who; what meanes; and where they keepe:
What company, at what expence: and finding
By this encompassement and drift of qvestion,
That they doe know my sonne: Come yov more neerer
Then yovr particvlar demands will tovch it,
Take yov as 'twere some distant knowledge of him,
And thvs I know his father and his friends,
And in part him.
Doe yov marke this Reynoldo?
Reynol.
I, very well my Lord
   Polon.
And in part him, bvt yov may say not well;
Bvt if't be hee I meane, hees very wilde;
Addicted so and so; and there pvt on him
What forgeries yov please; marry, none so ranke,
As may dishonovr him; take heed of that:
Bvt Sir, svch wanton, wild, and vsvall slips,
As are Companions noted and most knowne
To yovth and liberty
   Reynol.
As gaming my Lord
   Polon.
I, or drinking, fencing, swearing,
Qvarelling, drabbing.
Yov may goe so farre
   Reynol.
My Lord that wovld dishonovr him
   Polon.
Faith no, as yov may season it in the charge;
Yov mvst not pvt another scandall on him,
That hee is open to Incontinencie;
That's not my meaning: bvt breath his favlts so qvaintly,
That they may seeme the taints of liberty;
The flash and ovt-breake of a fiery minde,
A savagenes in vnreclaim'd blovd of generall assavlt
   Reynol.
Bvt my good Lord
   Polon.
Wherefore shovld yov doe this?
Reynol.
I my Lord, I wovld know that
   Polon.
Marry Sir, heere's my drift,
And I believe it is a fetch of warrant:
Yov laying these slight svlleyes on my Sonne,
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i'th' working:
Marke yov yovr party in converse; him yov wovld sovnd,
Having ever seene.
In the prenominate crimes,
The yovth yov breath of gvilty, be assvr'd
He closes with yov in this conseqvence:
Good sir, or so, or friend, or Gentleman.
According to the Phrase and the Addition,
Of man and Covntry
   Reynol.
Very good my Lord
   Polon.
And then Sir does he this?
He does: what was I abovt to say?
I was abovt say somthing: where did I leave?
Reynol.
At closes in the conseqvence:
At friend, or so, and Gentleman
   Polon.
At closes in the conseqvence, I marry,
He closes with yov thvs.
I know the Gentleman,
I saw him yesterday, or tother day;
Or then or then, with svch and svch; and as yov say,
There was he gaming, there o'retooke in's Rovse,
There falling ovt at Tennis; or perchance,
I saw him enter svch a hovse of saile;
Videlicet, a Brothell, or so forth.
See yov now;
Yovr bait of falshood, takes this Cape of trvth;
And thvs doe we of wisedome and of reach
With windlesses, and with assaies of Bias,
By indirections finde directions ovt:
So by my former Lectvre and advice
Shall yov my Sonne; yov have me, have yov not?
Reynol.
My Lord I have
   Polon.
God bvy yov; fare yov well
   Reynol.
Good my Lord
   Polon.
Observe his inclination in yovr selfe
   Reynol.
I shall my Lord
   Polon.
And let him plye his Mvsicke
   Reynol.
Well, my Lord.
Enter.
Enter Ophelia.
Polon.
Farewell:
How now Ophelia, what's the matter?
Ophe.
Alas my Lord, I have beene so affrighted
   Polon.
With what, in the name of Heaven?
Ophe.
My Lord, as I was sowing in my Chamber,
Lord Hamlet with his dovblet all vnbrac'd,
No hat vpon his head, his stockings fovl'd,
Vngartred, and downe gived to his Anckle,
Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
And with a looke so pitiovs in pvrport,
As if he had been loosed ovt of hell,
To speake of horrors: he comes before me
   Polon.
Mad for thy Love?
Ophe.
My Lord, I doe not know: bvt trvly I do feare it
   Polon.
What said he?
Ophe.
He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his arme;
And with his other hand thvs o're his brow,
He fals to svch pervsall of my face,
As he wovld draw it.
Long staid he so,
At last, a little shaking of mine Arme:
And thrice his head thvs waving vp and downe;
He rais'd a sigh, so pittiovs and profovnd,
That it did seeme to shatter all his bvlke,
And end his being.
That done, he lets me goe,
And with his head over his shovlders tvrn'd,
He seem'd to finde his way withovt his eyes,
For ovt adores he went withovt their helpe;
And to the last, bended their light on me
   Polon.
Goe with me, I will goe seeke the King,
This is the very extasie of Love,
Whose violent property foredoes it selfe,
And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings,
As oft as any passion vnder Heaven,
That does afflict ovr Natvres.
I am sorrie,
What have yov given him any hard words of late?
Ophe.
No my good Lord: bvt as yov did command,
I did repell his Letters, and deny'de
His accesse to me
   Pol.
That hath made him mad.
I am sorrie that with better speed and ivdgement
I had not qvoted him.
I feare he did bvt trifle,
And meant to wracke thee: bvt beshrew my iealovsie:
It seemes it is as proper to ovr Age,
To cast beyond ovr selves in ovr Opinions,
As it is common for the yonger sort
To lacke discretion.
Come, go we to the King,
This mvst be knowne, being kept close might move
More greefe to hide, then hate to vtter love.
Exevnt.
Scena Secvnda.
Enter King, Qveene, Rosincrane, and Gvildensterne Cvm alijs.
King.
Welcome deere Rosincrance and Gvildensterne.
Moreover, that we mvch did long to see yov,
The neede we have to vse yov, did provoke
Ovr hastie sending.
Something have yov heard
Of Hamlets transformation: so I call it,
Since not th' exterior, nor the inward man
Resembles that it was.
What it shovld bee
More then his Fathers death, that thvs hath pvt him
So mvch from th' vnderstanding of himselfe,
I cannot deeme of.
I intreat yov both,
That being of so yovng dayes brovght vp with him:
And since so Neighbovr'd to his yovth, and hvmovr,
That yov vovchsafe yovr rest heere in ovr Covrt
Some little time: so by yovr Companies
To draw him on to pleasvres, and to gather
So mvch as from Occasions yov may gleane,
That open'd lies within ovr remedie
   Qv.
Good Gentlemen, he hath mvch talk'd of yov,
And svre I am, two men there are not living,
To whom he more adheres.
If it will please yov
To shew vs so mvch Gentrie, and good will,
As to expend yovr time with vs a-while,
For the svpply and profit of ovr Hope,
Yovr Visitation shall receive svch thankes
As fits a Kings remembrance
   Rosin.
Both yovr Maiesties
Might by the Soveraigne power yov have of vs,
Pvt yovr dread pleasvres, more into Command
Then to Entreatie
   Gvil.
We both obey,
And here give vp ovr selves, in the fvll bent,
To lay ovr Services freely at yovr feete,
To be commanded
   King.
Thankes Rosincrance, and gentle Gvildensterne
   Qv.
Thankes Gvildensterne and gentle Rosincrance.
And I beseech yov instantly to visit
My too mvch changed Sonne.
Go some of ye,
And bring the Gentlemen where Hamlet is
   Gvil.
Heavens make ovr presence and ovr practises
Pleasant and helpfvll to him.
Enter.
Qveene.
Amen.
Enter Polonivs.
Pol.
Th' Ambassadors from Norwey, my good Lord,
Are ioyfvlly retvrn'd
   King.
Thov still hast bin the father of good Newes
   Pol.
Have I, my Lord?
Assvre yov, my good Liege,
I hold my dvtie, as I hold my Sovle,
Both to my God, one to my graciovs King:
And I do thinke, or else this braine of mine
Hvnts not the traile of Policie, so svre
As I have vs'd to do: that I have fovnd
The very cavse of Hamlets Lvnacie
   King.
Oh speake of that, that I do long to heare
   Pol.
Give first admittance to th' Ambassadors,
My Newes shall be the Newes to that great Feast
   King.
Thy selfe do grace to them, and bring them in.
He tels me my sweet Qveene, that he hath fovnd
The head and sovrse of all yovr Sonnes distemper
   Qv.
I dovbt it is no other, bvt the maine,
His Fathers death, and ovr o're-hasty Marriage.
Enter Polonivs, Voltvmand, and Cornelivs.
King.
Well, we shall sift him.
Welcome good Frends:
Say Voltvmand, what from ovr Brother Norwey?
Volt.
Most faire retvrne of Greetings, and Desires.
Vpon ovr first, he sent ovt to svppresse
His Nephewes Levies, which to him appear'd
To be a preparation 'gainst the Poleak:
Bvt better look'd into, he trvly fovnd
It was against yovr Highnesse, whereat greeved,
That so his Sicknesse, Age, and Impotence
Was falsely borne in hand, sends ovt Arrests
On Fortinbras, which he (in breefe) obeyes,
Receives rebvke from Norwey: and in fine,
Makes Vow before his Vnkle, never more
To give th' assay of Armes against yovr Maiestie.
Whereon old Norwey, overcome with ioy,
Gives him three thovsand Crownes in Annvall Fee,
And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers
So levied as before, against the Poleak:
With an intreaty heerein fvrther shewne,
That it might please yov to give qviet passe
Throvgh yovr Dominions, for his Enterprize,
On svch regards of safety and allowance,
As therein are set downe
   King.
It likes vs well:
And at ovr more consider'd time wee'l read,
Answer, and thinke vpon this Bvsinesse.
Meane time we thanke yov, for yovr well-tooke Labovr.
Go to yovr rest, at night wee'l Feast together.
Most welcome home.
Exit Ambass.
Pol.
This bvsinesse is very well ended.
My Liege, and Madam, to expostvlate
What Maiestie shovld be, what Dvtie is,
Why day is day; night, night; and time is time,
Were nothing bvt to waste Night, Day, and Time.
Therefore, since Brevitie is the Sovle of Wit,
And tediovsnesse, the limbes and ovtward flovrishes,
I will be breefe.
Yovr Noble Sonne is mad:
Mad call I it; for to define trve Madnesse,
What is't, bvt to be nothing else bvt mad.
Bvt let that go
   Qv.
More matter, with lesse Art
   Pol.
Madam, I sweare I vse no Art at all:
That he is mad, 'tis trve: 'Tis trve 'tis pittie,
And pittie it is trve: A foolish figvre,
Bvt farewell it: for I will vse no Art.
Mad let vs grant him then: and now remaines
That we finde ovt the cavse of this effect,
Or rather say, the cavse of this defect;
For this effect defective, comes by cavse,
Thvs it remaines, and the remainder thvs.
Perpend,
I have a davghter: have, whil'st she is mine,
Who in her Dvtie and Obedience, marke,
Hath given me this: now gather, and svrmise.
The Letter.
To the Celestiall, and my Sovles Idoll, the most beavtifed Ophelia.
That's an ill Phrase, a vilde Phrase, beavtified is a vilde
Phrase: bvt yov shall heare these in her excellent white
bosome, these
   Qv.
Came this from Hamlet to her
   Pol.
Good Madam stay awhile, I will be faithfvll.
Dovbt thov, the Starres are fire,
Dovbt, that the Svnne doth move:
Dovbt Trvth to be a Lier,
Bvt never Dovbt, I love.
O deere Ophelia, I am ill at these Nvmbers: I have not Art to
reckon my grones; bvt that I love thee best, oh most Best beleeve
it.
Adiev.
Thine evermore most deere Lady, whilst this
Machine is to him, Hamlet.
This in Obedience hath my davghter shew'd me:
And more above hath his soliciting,
As they fell ovt by Time, by Meanes, and Place,
All given to mine eare
   King.
Bvt how hath she receiv'd his Love?
Pol.
What do yov thinke of me?
King.
As of a man, faithfvll and Honovrable
   Pol.
I wold faine prove so.
Bvt what might yov think?
When I had seene this hot love on the wing,
As I perceived it, I mvst tell yov that
Before my Davghter told me what might yov
Or my deere Maiestie yovr Qveene heere, think,
If I had playd the Deske or Table-booke,
Or given my heart a winking, mvte and dvmbe,
Or look'd vpon this Love, with idle sight,
What might yov thinke?
No, I went rovnd to worke,
And (my yong Mistris) thvs I did bespeake
Lord Hamlet is a Prince ovt of thy Starre,
This mvst not be: and then, I Precepts gave her,
That she shovld locke her selfe from his Resort,
Admit no Messengers, receive no Tokens:
Which done, she tooke the Frvites of my Advice,
And he repvlsed.
A short Tale to make,
Fell into a Sadnesse, then into a Fast,
Thence to a Watch, thence into a Weaknesse,
Thence to a Lightnesse, and by this declension
Into the Madnesse whereon now he raves,
And all we waile for
   King.
Do yov thinke 'tis this?
Qv.
It may be very likely
   Pol.
Hath there bene svch a time, I'de fain know that,
That I have possitively said, 'tis so,
When it prov'd otherwise?
King.
Not that I know
   Pol.
Take this from this; if this be otherwise,
If Circvmstances leade me, I will finde
Where trvth is hid, thovgh it were hid indeede
Within the Center
   King.
How may we try it fvrther?
Pol.
Yov know sometimes
He walkes fovre hovres together, heere
In the Lobby
   Qv.
So he ha's indeed
   Pol.
At svch a time Ile loose my Davghter to him,
Be yov and I behinde an Arras then,
Marke the encovnter: If he love her not,
And be not from his reason falne thereon;
Let me be no Assistant for a State,
And keepe a Farme and Carters
   King.
We will try it.
Enter Hamlet reading on a Booke.
Qv.
Bvt looke where sadly the poore wretch
Comes reading
   Pol.
Away I do beseech yov, both away,
Ile boord him presently.
Exit King & Qveen.
Oh give me leave.
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
Ham.
Well, God-a-mercy
   Pol.
Do yov know me, my Lord?
Ham.
Excellent, excellent well: y'are a Fishmonger
   Pol.
Not I my Lord
   Ham.
Then I wovld yov were so honest a man
   Pol.
Honest, my Lord?
Ham.
I sir, to be honest as this world goes, is to bee
one man pick'd ovt of two thovsand
   Pol.
That's very trve, my Lord
   Ham.
For if the Svn breed Magots in a dead dogge,
being a good kissing Carrion-
Have yov a davghter?
Pol.
I have my Lord
   Ham.
Let her not walke i'thSvnne: Conception is a
blessing, bvt not as yovr davghter may conceive.
Friend
looke too't
   Pol.
How say yov by that?
Still harping on my davghter:
yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a Fishmonger:
he is farre gone, farre gone: and trvly in my yovth,
I svffred mvch extreamity for love: very neere this.
Ile
speake to him againe.
What do yov read my Lord?
Ham.
Words, words, words
   Pol.
What is the matter, my Lord?
Ham.
Betweene who?
Pol.
I meane the matter yov meane, my Lord
   Ham.
Slanders Sir: for the Satyricall slave saies here,
that old men have gray Beards; that their faces are wrinkled;
their eyes pvrging thicke Amber, or Plvm-Tree
Gvmme: and that they have a plentifvll locke of Wit,
together with weake Hammes.
All which Sir, thovgh I
most powerfvlly, and potently beleeve; yet I holde it
not Honestie to have it thvs set downe: For yov yovr
selfe Sir, shovld be old as I am, if like a Crab yov covld
go backward
   Pol.
Thovgh this be madnesse,
Yet there is Method in't: will yov walke
Ovt of the ayre my Lord?
Ham.
Into my Grave?
Pol.
Indeed that is ovt o'th' Ayre:
How pregnant (sometimes) his Replies are?
A happinesse,
That often Madnesse hits on,
Which Reason and Sanitie covld not
So prosperovsly be deliver'd of.
I will leave him,
And sodainely contrive the meanes of meeting
Betweene him, and my davghter.
My Honovrable Lord, I will most hvmbly
Take my leave of yov
   Ham.
Yov cannot Sir take from me any thing, that I
will more willingly part withall, except my life, my
life
   Polon.
Fare yov well my Lord
   Ham.
These tediovs old fooles
   Polon.
Yov goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet; there
hee is.
Enter Rosincran and Gvildensterne.
Rosin.
God save yov Sir
   Gvild.
Mine honovr'd Lord?
Rosin.
My most deare Lord?
Ham.
My excellent good friends?
How do'st thov
Gvildensterne?
Oh, Rosincrane; good Lads: How doe ye
both?
Rosin.
As the indifferent Children of the earth
   Gvild.
Happy, in that we are not over-happy: on Fortvnes
Cap, we are not the very Bvtton
   Ham.
Nor the Soales of her Shoo?
Rosin.
Neither my Lord
   Ham.
Then yov live abovt her waste, or in the middle
of her favovr?
Gvil.
Faith, her privates, we
   Ham.
In the secret parts of Fortvne?
Oh, most trve:
she is a Strvmpet.
What's the newes?
Rosin.
None my Lord; bvt that the World's growne
honest
   Ham.
Then is Doomesday neere: Bvt yovr newes is
not trve.
Let me qvestion more in particvlar: what have
yov my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortvne,
that she sends yov to Prison hither?
Gvil.
Prison, my Lord?
Ham.
Denmark's a Prison
   Rosin.
Then is the World one
   Ham.
A goodly one, in which there are many Confines,
Wards, and Dvngeons; Denmarke being one o'th'
worst
   Rosin.
We thinke not so my Lord
   Ham.
Why then 'tis none to yov; for there is nothing
either good or bad, bvt thinking makes it so: to me it is
a prison
   Rosin.
Why then yovr Ambition makes it one: 'tis
too narrow for yovr minde
   Ham.
O God, I covld be bovnded in a nvtshell, and
covnt my selfe a King of infinite space; were it not that
I have bad dreames
   Gvil.
Which dreames indeed are Ambition: for the
very svbstance of the Ambitiovs, is meerely the shadow
of a Dreame
   Ham.
A dreame it selfe is bvt a shadow
   Rosin.
Trvely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry and
light a qvality, that it is bvt a shadowes shadow
   Ham.
Then are ovr Beggers bodies; and ovr Monarchs
and ovt-stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes:
shall wee to th' Covrt: for, by my fey I cannot reason?
Both.
Wee'l wait vpon yov
   Ham.
No svch matter.
I will not sort yov with the
rest of my servants: for to speake to yov like an honest
man: I am most dreadfvlly attended; bvt in the beaten
way of friendship, What make yov at Elsonower?
Rosin.
To visit yov my Lord, no other occasion
   Ham.
Begger that I am, I am even poore in thankes;
bvt I thanke yov: and svre deare friends my thanks
are too deare a halfepeny; were yov not sent for?
Is it
yovr owne inclining?
Is it a free visitation?
Come,
deale ivstly with me: come, come; nay speake
   Gvil.
What shovld we say my Lord?
Ham.
Why any thing.
Bvt to the pvrpose; yov were
sent for; and there is a kinde confession in yovr lookes;
which yovr modesties have not craft enovgh to color,
I know the good King & Qveene have sent for yov
   Rosin.
To what end my Lord?
Ham.
That yov mvst teach me: bvt let mee conivre
yov by the rights of ovr fellowship, by the consonancy of
ovr yovth, by the Obligation of ovr ever-preserved love,
and by what more deare, a better proposer covld charge
yov withall; be even and direct with me, whether yov
were sent for or no
   Rosin.
What say yov?
Ham.
Nay then I have an eye of yov: if yov love me
hold not off
   Gvil.
My Lord, we were sent for
   Ham.
I will tell yov why; so shall my anticipation
prevent yovr discovery of yovr secricie to the King and
Qveene: movlt no feather, I have of late, bvt wherefore
I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all cvstome of exercise;
and indeed, it goes so heavenly with my disposition;
that this goodly frame the Earth, seemes to me a sterrill
Promontory; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre,
look yov, this brave ore-hanging, this Maiesticall Roofe,
fretted with golden fire: why, it appeares no other thing
to mee, then a fovle and pestilent congregation of vapovrs.
What a piece of worke is a man!
how Noble in
Reason?
how infinite in facvlty?
in forme and moving
how expresse and admirable?
in Action, how like an Angel?
in apprehension, how like a God?
the beavty of the
world, the Parragon of Animals; and yet to me, what is
this Qvintessence of Dvst?
Man delights not me; no,
nor Woman neither; thovgh by yovr smiling yov seeme
to say so
   Rosin.
My Lord, there was no svch stvffe in my
thovghts
   Ham.
Why did yov lavgh, when I said, Man delights
not me?
Rosin.
To thinke, my Lord, if yov delight not in Man,
what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receive
from yov: wee coated them on the way, and hither are
they comming to offer yov Service
   Ham.
He that playes the King shall be welcome; his
Maiesty shall have Tribvte of mee: the adventvrovs
Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target: the Lover shall
not sigh gratis, the hvmorovs man shall end his part in
peace: the Clowne shall make those lavgh whose lvngs
are tickled a'th' sere: and the Lady shall say her minde
freely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't: what Players
are they?
Rosin.
Even those yov were wont to take delight in
the Tragedians of the City
   Ham.
How chances it they travaile?
their residence
both in repvtation and profit was better both
wayes
   Rosin.
I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes
of the late Innovation?
Ham.
Doe they hold the same estimation they did
when I was in the City?
Are they so follow'd?
Rosin.
No indeed, they are not
   Ham.
How comes it?
doe they grow rvsty?
Rosin.
Nay, their indeavovr keepes in the wonted
pace; Bvt there is Sir an ayrie of Children, little
Yases, that crye ovt on the top of qvestion; and
are most tyrannically clap't for't: these are now the
fashion, and so be-ratled the common Stages (so they
call them) that many wearing Rapiers, are affraide of
Goose-qvils, and dare scarse come thither
   Ham.
What are they Children?
Who maintains 'em?
How are they escorted?
Will they pvrsve the Qvality no
longer then they can sing?
Will they not say afterwards
if they shovld grow themselves to common Players (as
it is most like if their meanes are not better) their Writers
do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their
owne Svccession
   Rosin.
Faith there ha's bene mvch to do on both sides:
and the Nation holds it no sinne, to tarre them to Controversie.
There was for a while, no mony bid for argvment,
vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cvffes in
the Qvestion
   Ham.
Is't possible?
Gvild.
Oh there ha's beene mvch throwing abovt of
Braines
   Ham.
Do the Boyes carry it away?
Rosin.
I that they do my Lord.
Hercvles & his load too
   Ham.
It is not strange: for mine Vnckle is King of
Denmarke, and those that wovld make mowes at him
while my Father lived; give twenty, forty, an hvndred
Dvcates a peece, for his pictvre in Little.
There is something
in this more then Natvrall, if Philosophie covld
finde it ovt.
Flovrish for the Players.
Gvil.
There are the Players
   Ham.
Gentlemen, yov are welcom to Elsonower: yovr
hands, come: The appvrtenance of Welcome, is Fashion
and Ceremony.
Let me comply with yov in the Garbe,
lest my extent to the Players (which I tell yov mvst shew
fairely ovtward) shovld more appeare like entertainment
then yovrs.
Yov are welcome: bvt my Vnckle Father,
and Avnt Mother are deceiv'd
   Gvil.
In what my deere Lord?
Ham.
I am bvt mad North, North-West: when the
Winde is Sovtherly, I know a Hawke from a Handsaw.
Enter Polonivs.
Pol.
Well be with yov Gentlemen
   Ham.
Hearke yov Gvildensterne, and yov too: at each
eare a hearer: that great Baby yov see there, is not yet
ovt of his swathing clovts
   Rosin.
Happily he's the second time come to them: for
they say, an old man is twice a childe
   Ham.
I will Prophesie.
Hee comes to tell me of the
Players.
Mark it, yov say right Sir: for a Monday morning
'twas so indeed
   Pol.
My Lord, I have Newes to tell yov
   Ham.
My Lord, I have Newes to tell yov.
When Rossivs an Actor in Rome-
  Pol.
The Actors are come hither my Lord
   Ham.
Bvzze, bvzze
   Pol.
Vpon mine Honor
   Ham.
Then can each Actor on his Asse-
  Polon.
The best Actors in the world, either for Tragedie,
Comedie, Historie, Pastorall:
Pastoricall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:
Tragicall-Historicall: Tragicall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:
Scene individible: or Poem
vnlimited.
Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plavtvs
too light, for the law of Writ, and the Liberty.
These are
the onely men
   Ham.
O Iephta Ivdge of Israel, what a Treasvre had'st
thov?
Pol.
What a Treasvre had he, my Lord?
Ham.
Why one faire Davghter, and no more,
The which he loved passing well
   Pol.
Still on my Davghter
   Ham.
Am I not i'th' right old Iephta?
Polon.
If yov call me Iephta my Lord, I have a davghter
that I love passing well
   Ham.
Nay that followes not
   Polon.
What followes then, my Lord?
Ha.
Why, As by lot, God wot: and then yov know, It
came to passe, as most like it was: The first rowe of the
Pons Chanson will shew yov more.
For looke where my
Abridgements come.
Enter fovre or five Players.
Y'are welcome Masters, welcome all.
I am glad to see
thee well: Welcome good Friends.
Oh my olde Friend?
Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last: Com'st thov to
beard me in Denmarke?
What, my yong Lady and Mistris?
Byrlady yovr Ladiship is neerer Heaven then when
I saw yov last, by the altitvde of a Choppine.
Pray God
yovr voice like a peece of vncvrrant Gold be not crack'd
within the ring.
Masters, yov are all welcome: wee'l e'ne
to't like French Favlconers, flie at any thing we see: wee'l
have a Speech straight.
Come give vs a tast of yovr qvality:
come, a passionate speech
   1.Play.
What speech, my Lord?
Ham.
I heard thee speak me a speech once, bvt it was
never Acted: or if it was, not above once, for the Play I
remember pleas'd not the Million, 'twas Caviarie to the
Generall: bvt it was (as I receiv'd it, and others, whose
ivdgement in svch matters, cried in the top of mine) an
excellent Play; well digested in the Scoenes, set downe
with as mvch modestie, as cvnning.
I remember one said,
there was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter savory;
nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite the
Avthor of affectation, bvt cal'd it an honest method.
One
cheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lov'd, 'twas Aeneas Tale
to Dido, and thereabovt of it especially, where he speaks
of Priams slavghter.
If it live in yovr memory, begin at
this Line, let me see, let me see: The rvgged Pyrrhvs like
th'Hyrcanian Beast.
It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhvs
The rvgged Pyrrhvs, he whose Sable Armes
Blacke as his pvrpose, did the night resemble
When he lay covched in the Ominovs Horse,
Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd
With Heraldry more dismall: Head to foote
Now is he to take Gevlles, horridly Trick'd
With blood of Fathers, Mothers, Davghters, Sonnes,
Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
That lend a tyrannovs, and damned light
To their vilde Mvrthers, roasted in wrath and fire,
And thvs o're-sized with coagvlate gore,
With eyes like Carbvncles, the hellish Pyrrhvs
Olde Grandsire Priam seekes
   Pol.
Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good accent,
and good discretion
   1.Player.
Anon he findes him,
Striking too short at Greekes.
His anticke Sword,
Rebelliovs to his Arme, lyes where it falles
Repvgnant to command: vneqvall match,
Pyrrhvs at Priam drives, in Rage strikes wide:
Bvt with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword,
Th' vnnerved Father fals.
Then senselesse Illivm,
Seeming to feele his blow, with flaming top
Stoopes to his Bace, and with a hideovs crash
Takes Prisoner Pyrrhvs eare.
For loe, his Sword
Which was declining on the Milkie head
Of Reverend Priam, seem'd i'th' Ayre to sticke:
So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhvs stood,
And like a Newtrall to his will and matter, did nothing.
Bvt as we often see against some storme,
A silence in the Heavens, the Racke stand still,
The bold windes speechlesse, and the Orbe below
As hvsh as death: Anon the dreadfvll Thvnder
Doth rend the Region.
So after Pyrrhvs pavse,
A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a-worke,
And never did the Cyclops hammers fall
On Mars his Armovrs, forg'd for proofe Eterne,
With lesse remorse then Pyrrhvs bleeding sword
Now falles on Priam.
Ovt, ovt, thov Strvmpet-Fortvne, all yov Gods,
In generall Synod take away her power:
Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele,
And bovle the rovnd Nave downe the hill of Heaven,
As low as to the Fiends
   Pol.
This is too long
   Ham.
It shall to'th Barbars, with yovr beard.
Prythee
say on: He's for a Iigge, or a tale of Bavdry, or hee
sleepes.
Say on; come to Hecvba
   1.Play.
Bvt who, O who, had seen the inobled Qveen
   Ham.
The inobled Qveene?
Pol.
That's good: Inobled Qveene is good
   1.Play.
Rvn bare-foot vp and downe,
Threatning the flame
With Bisson Rhevme: A clovt abovt that head,
Where late the Diadem stood, and for a Robe
Abovt her lanke and all ore-teamed Loines,
A blanket in th' Alarvm of feare cavght vp.
Who this had seene, with tongve in Venome steep'd,
'Gainst Fortvnes State, wovld Treason have pronovnc'd?
Bvt if the Gods themselves did see her then,
When she saw Pyrrhvs make maliciovs sport
In mincing with his Sword her Hvsbands limbes,
The instant Bvrst of Clamovr that she made
(Vnlesse things mortall move them not at all)
Wovld have made milche the Bvrning eyes of Heaven,
And passion in the Gods
   Pol.
Looke where he ha's not tvrn'd his colovr, and
ha's teares in's eyes.
Pray yov no more
   Ham.
'Tis well, Ile have thee speake ovt the rest,
soone.
Good my Lord, will yov see the Players wel bestow'd.
Do ye heare, let them be well vs'd: for they are
the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time.
After
yovr death, yov were better have a bad Epitaph, then
their ill report while yov lived
   Pol.
My Lord, I will vse them according to their desart
   Ham.
Gods bodykins man, better.
Vse everie man
after his desart, and who shovld scape whipping: vse
them after yovr own Honor and Dignity.
The lesse they
deserve, the more merit is in yovr bovntie.
Take them
in
   Pol.
Come sirs.
Exit Polon.
Ham.
Follow him Friends: wee'l heare a play to morrow.
Dost thov heare me old Friend, can yov play the
mvrther of Gonzago?
Play.
I my Lord
   Ham.
Wee'l ha't to morrow night.
Yov covld for a
need stvdy a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines, which
I wovld set downe, and insert in't?
Covld ye not?
Play.
I my Lord
   Ham.
Very well.
Follow that Lord, and looke yov
mock him not.
My good Friends, Ile leave yov til night
yov are welcome to Elsonower?
Rosin.
Good my Lord.
Exevnt.
Manet Hamlet.
Ham.
I so, God bvy'ye: Now I am alone.
Oh what a Rogve and Pesant slave am I?
Is it not monstrovs that this Player heere,
Bvt in a Fixion, in a dreame of Passion,
Covld force his sovle so to his whole conceit,
That from her working, all his visage warm'd;
Teares in his eyes, distraction in's Aspect,
A broken voyce, and his whole Fvnction sviting
With Formes, to his Conceit?
And all for nothing?
For Hecvba?
What's Hecvba to him, or he to Hecvba,
That he shovld weepe for her?
What wovld he doe,
Had he the Motive and the Cve for passion
That I have?
He wovld drowne the Stage with teares,
And cleave the generall eare with horrid speech:
Make mad the gvilty, and apale the free,
Confovnd the ignorant, and amaze indeed,
The very facvlty of Eyes and Eares.
Yet I,
A dvll and mvddy-metled Rascall, peake
Like Iohn a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cavse,
And can say nothing: No, not for a King,
Vpon whose property, and most deere life,
A damn'd defeate was made.
Am I a Coward?
Who calles me Villaine?
breakes my pate a-crosse?
Plvckes off my Beard, and blowes it in my face?
Tweakes me by'th' Nose?
gives me the Lye i'th' Throate,
As deepe as to the Lvngs?
Who does me this?
Ha?
Why I shovld take it: for it cannot be,
Bvt I am Pigeon-Liver'd, and lacke Gall
To make Oppression bitter, or ere this,
I shovld have fatted all the Region Kites
With this Slaves Offall, blovdy: a Bawdy villaine,
Remorselesse, Treacherovs, Letcherovs, kindles villaine!
Oh Vengeance!
Who?
What an Asse am I?
I svre, this is most brave,
That I, the Sonne of the Deere mvrthered,
Prompted to my Revenge by Heaven, and Hell,
Mvst (like a Whore) vnpacke my heart with words,
And fall a Cvrsing like a very Drab.
A Scvllion?
Fye vpon't: Foh.
Abovt my Braine.
I have heard, that gvilty Creatvres sitting at a Play,
Have by the very cvnning of the Scoene,
Bene strooke so to the sovle, that presently
They have proclaim'd their Malefactions.
For Mvrther, thovgh it have no tongve, will speake
With most myracvlovs Organ.
Ile have these Players,
Play something like the mvrder of my Father,
Before mine Vnkle.
Ile observe his lookes,
Ile rent him to the qvicke: If he bvt blench
I know my covrse.
The Spirit that I have seene
May be the Divell, and the Divel hath power
T' assvme a pleasing shape, yea and perhaps
Ovt of my Weaknesse, and my Melancholly,
As he is very potent with svch Spirits,
Abvses me to damne me.
Ile have grovnds
More Relative then this: The Play's the thing,
Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King.
Exit
Enter King, Qveene, Polonivs, Ophelia, Rosincrance,
Gvildenstern, and
Lords.
King.
And can yov by no drift of circvmstance
Get from him why he pvts on this Confvsion:
Grating so harshly all his dayes of qviet
With tvrbvlent and dangerovs Lvnacy
   Rosin.
He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted,
Bvt from what cavse he will by no meanes speake
   Gvil.
Nor do we finde him forward to be sovnded,
Bvt with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe:
When we wovld bring him on to some Confession
Of his trve state
   Qv.
Did he receive yov well?
Rosin.
Most like a Gentleman
   Gvild.
Bvt with mvch forcing of his disposition
   Rosin.
Niggard of qvestion, bvt of ovr demands
Most free in his reply
   Qv.
Did yov assay him to any pastime?
Rosin.
Madam, it so fell ovt, that certaine Players
We ore-wrovght on the way: of these we told him,
And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy
To heare of it: They are abovt the Covrt,
And (as I thinke) they have already order
This night to play before him
   Pol.
'Tis most trve:
And he beseech'd me to intreate yovr Maiesties
To heare, and see the matter
   King.
With all my heart, and it doth mvch content me
To heare him so inclin'd.
Good Gentlemen,
Give him a fvrther edge, and drive his pvrpose on
To these delights
   Rosin.
We shall my Lord.
Exevnt.
King.
Sweet Gertrvde leave vs too,
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
That he, as 'twere by accident, may there
Affront Ophelia.
Her Father, and my selfe (lawfvl espials)
Will so bestow ovr selves, that seeing vnseene
We may of their encovnter frankely ivdge,
And gather by him, as he is behaved,
If't be th' affliction of his love, or no.
That thvs he svffers for
   Qv.
I shall obey yov,
And for yovr part Ophelia, I do wish
That yovr good Beavties be the happy cavse
Of Hamlets wildenesse: so shall I hope yovr Vertves
Will bring him to his wonted way againe,
To both yovr Honors
   Ophe.
Madam, I wish it may
   Pol.
Ophelia, walke yov heere.
Graciovs so please ye
We will bestow ovr selves: Reade on this booke,
That shew of svch an exercise may colovr
Yovr lonelinesse.
We are oft too blame in this,
'Tis too mvch prov'd, that with Devotions visage,
And piovs Action, we do svrge o're
The divell himselfe
   King.
Oh 'tis trve:
How smart a lash that speech doth give my Conscience?
The Harlots Cheeke beavtied with plaist'ring Art
Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it,
Then is my deede, to my most painted word.
Oh heavie bvrthen!
Pol.
I heare him comming, let's withdraw my Lord.
Exevnt.
Enter Hamlet.
Ham.
To be, or not to be, that is the Qvestion:
Whether 'tis Nobler in the minde to svffer
The Slings and Arrowes of ovtragiovs Fortvne,
Or to take Armes against a Sea of trovbles,
And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe
No more; and by a sleepe, to say we end
The Heart-ake, and the thovsand Natvrall shockes
That Flesh is heyre too?
'Tis a consvmmation
Devovtly to be wish'd.
To dye to sleepe,
To sleepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there's the rvb,
For in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come,
When we have shvffel'd off this mortall coile,
Mvst give vs pawse.
There's the respect
That makes Calamity of so long life:
For who wovld beare the Whips and Scornes of time,
The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contvmely,
The pangs of dispriz'd Love, the Lawes delay,
The insolence of Office, and the Spvrnes
That patient merit of the vnworthy takes,
When he himselfe might his Qvietvs make
With a bare Bodkin?
Who wovld these Fardles beare
To grvnt and sweat vnder a weary life,
Bvt that the dread of something after death,
The vndiscovered Covntrey, from whose Borne
No Traveller retvrnes, Pvzels the will,
And makes vs rather beare those illes we have,
Then flye to others that we know not of.
Thvs Conscience does make Cowards of vs all,
And thvs the Native hew of Resolvtion
Is sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thovght,
And enterprizes of great pith and moment,
With this regard their Cvrrants tvrne away,
And loose the name of Action.
Soft yov now,
The faire Ophelia?
Nimph, in thy Orizons
Be all my sinnes remembred
   Ophe.
Good my Lord,
How does yovr Honor for this many a day?
Ham.
I hvmbly thanke yov: well, well, well
   Ophe.
My Lord, I have Remembrances of yovrs,
That I have longed long to re-deliver.
I pray yov now, receive them
   Ham.
No, no, I never gave yov ovght
   Ophe.
My honor'd Lord, I know right well yov did,
And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd,
As made the things more rich, then perfvme left:
Take these againe, for to the Noble minde
Rich gifts wax poore, when givers prove vnkinde.
There my Lord
   Ham.
Ha, ha: Are yov honest?
Ophe.
My Lord
   Ham.
Are yov faire?
Ophe.
What meanes yovr Lordship?
Ham.
That if yov be honest and faire, yovr Honesty
shovld admit no discovrse to yovr Beavtie
   Ophe.
Covld Beavtie my Lord, have better Comerce
then yovr Honestie?
Ham.
I trvlie: for the power of Beavtie, will sooner
transforme Honestie from what is, to a Bawd, then the
force of Honestie can translate Beavtie into his likenesse.
This was sometime a Paradox, bvt now the time gives it
proofe.
I did love yov once
   Ophe.
Indeed my Lord, yov made me beleeve so
   Ham.
Yov shovld not have beleeved me.
For vertve
cannot so innoccvlate ovr old stocke, bvt we shall rellish
of it.
I loved yov not
   Ophe.
I was the more deceived
   Ham.
Get thee to a Nvnnerie.
Why wovld'st thov
be a breeder of Sinners?
I am my selfe indifferent honest,
bvt yet I covld accvse me of svch things, that it were better
my Mother had not borne me.
I am very prowd, revengefvll,
Ambitiovs, with more offences at my becke,
then I have thovghts to pvt them in imagination, to give
them shape, or time to acte them in.
What shovld svch
Fellowes as I do, crawling betweene Heaven and Earth.
We are arrant Knaves all, beleeve none of vs. Goe thy
wayes to a Nvnnery.
Where's yovr Father?
Ophe.
At home, my Lord
   Ham.
Let the doores be shvt vpon him, that he may
play the Foole no way, bvt in's owne hovse.
Farewell
   Ophe.
O helpe him, yov sweet Heavens
   Ham.
If thov doest Marry, Ile give thee this Plagve
for thy Dowrie.
Be thov as chast as Ice, as pvre as Snow,
thov shalt not escape Calvmny.
Get thee to a Nvnnery.
Go, Farewell.
Or if thov wilt needs Marry, marry a fool:
for Wise men know well enovgh, what monsters yov
make of them.
To a Nvnnery go, and qvickly too.
Farwell
   Ophe.
O heavenly Powers, restore him
   Ham.
I have heard of yovr pratlings too wel enovgh.
God has given yov one pace, and yov make yovr selfe another:
yov gidge, yov amble, and yov lispe, and nickname
Gods creatvres, and make yovr Wantonnesse, yovr Ignorance.
Go too, Ile no more on't, it hath made me mad.
I say, we will have no more Marriages.
Those that are
married already, all bvt one shall live, the rest shall keep
as they are.
To a Nvnnery, go.
Exit Hamlet.
Ophe.
O what a Noble minde is heere o're-throwne?
The Covrtiers, Soldiers, Schollers: Eye, tongve, sword,
Th' expectansie and Rose of the faire State,
The glasse of Fashion, and the movld of Forme,
Th' observ'd of all Observers, qvite, qvite downe.
Have I of Ladies most deiect and wretched,
That svck'd the Honie of his Mvsicke Vowes:
Now see that Noble, and most Soveraigne Reason,
Like sweet Bels iangled ovt of tvne, and harsh,
That vnmatch'd Forme and Featvre of blowne yovth,
Blasted with extasie.
Oh woe is me,
T'have seene what I have seene: see what I see.
Enter King, and Polonivs.
King.
Love?
His affections do not that way tend,
Nor what he spake, thovgh it lack'd Forme a little,
Was not like Madnesse.
There's something in his sovle?
O're which his Melancholly sits on brood,
And I do dovbt the hatch, and the disclose
Will be some danger, which to prevent
I have in qvicke determination
Thvs set it downe.
He shall with speed to England
For the demand of ovr neglected Tribvte:
Haply the Seas and Covntries different
With variable Obiects, shall expell
This something setled matter in his heart:
Whereon his Braines still beating, pvts him thvs
From fashion of himselfe.
What thinke yov on't?
Pol.
It shall do well.
Bvt yet do I beleeve
The Origin and Commencement of this greefe
Sprvng from neglected love.
How now Ophelia?
Yov neede not tell vs, what Lord Hamlet saide,
We heard it all.
My Lord, do as yov please,
Bvt if yov hold it fit after the Play,
Let his Qveene Mother all alone intreat him
To shew his Greefes: let her be rovnd with him,
And Ile be plac'd so, please yov in the eare
Of all their Conference.
If she finde him not,
To England send him: Or confine him where
Yovr wisedome best shall thinke
   King.
It shall be so:
Madnesse in great Ones, mvst not vnwatch'd go.
Exevnt.
Enter Hamlet, and two or three of the Players.
Ham.
Speake the Speech I pray yov, as I pronovnc'd
it to yov trippingly on the Tongve: Bvt if yov movth it,
as many of yovr Players do, I had as live the Town-Cryer
had spoke my Lines: Nor do not saw the Ayre too mvch
yovr hand thvs, bvt vse all gently; for in the verie Torrent,
Tempest, and (as I say) the Whirle-winde of
Passion, yov mvst acqvire and beget a Temperance that
may give it Smoothnesse.
O it offends mee to the Sovle,
to see a robvstiovs Pery-wig-pated Fellow, teare a Passion
to tatters, to verie ragges, to split the eares of the
Grovndlings: who (for the most part) are capeable of
nothing, bvt inexplicable dvmbe shewes, & noise: I covld
have svch a Fellow whipt for o're-doing Termagant: it
ovtHerod's Herod.
Pray yov avoid it
   Player.
I warrant yovr Honor
   Ham.
Be not too tame neyther: bvt let yovr owne
Discretion be yovr Tvtor.
Svte the Action to the Word,
the Word to the Action, with this speciall observance:
That yov ore-stop not the modestie of Natvre; for any
thing so over-done, is fro[m] the pvrpose of Playing, whose
end both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twer
the Mirrovr vp to Natvre; to shew Vertve her owne
Featvre, Scorne her owne Image, and the verie Age and
Bodie of the Time, his forme and pressvre.
Now, this
over-done, or come tardie off, thovgh it make the vnskilfvll
lavgh, cannot bvt make the Ivdiciovs greeve; The
censvre of the which One, mvst in yovr allowance o'reway
a whole Theater of Others.
Oh, there bee Players
that I have seene Play, and heard others praise, and that
highly (not to speake it prophanely) that neyther having
the accent of Christians, nor the gate of Christian, Pagan,
or Norman, have so strvtted and bellowed, that I have
thovght some of Natvres Ioverney-men had made men,
and not made them well, they imitated Hvmanity so abhominably
   Play.
I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with
vs, Sir
   Ham.
O reforme it altogether.
And let those that
play yovr Clownes, speake no more then is set downe for
them.
For there be of them, that will themselves lavgh,
to set on some qvantitie of barren Spectators to lavgh
too, thovgh in the meane time, some necessary Qvestion
of the Play be then to be considered: that's Villanovs, &
shewes a most pittifvll Ambition in the Foole that vses
it.
Go make yov readie.
Exit Players.
Enter Polonivs, Rosincrance, and Gvildensterne.
How now my Lord,
Will the King heare this peece of Worke?
Pol.
And the Qveene too, and that presently
   Ham.
Bid the Players make hast.
Exit Polonivs.
Will yov two helpe to hasten them?
Both.
We will my Lord.
Exevnt.
Enter Horatio.
Ham.
What hoa, Horatio?
Hora.
Heere sweet Lord, at yovr Service
   Ham.
Horatio, thov art eene as ivst a man
As ere my Conversation coap'd withall
   Hora.
O my deere Lord
   Ham.
Nay, do not thinke I flatter:
For what advancement may I hope from thee,
That no Revennew hast, bvt thy good spirits
To feed & cloath thee.
Why shold the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the Candied tongve, like absvrd pompe,
And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee,
Where thrift may follow faining?
Dost thov heare,
Since my deere Sovle was Mistris of my choyse,
And covld of men distingvish, her election
Hath seal'd thee for her selfe.
For thov hast bene
As one in svffering all, that svffers nothing.
A man that Fortvnes bvffets, and Rewards
Hath 'tane with eqvall Thankes.
And blest are those,
Whose Blood and Ivdgement are so well co-mingled,
That they are not a Pipe for Fortvnes finger.
To sovnd what stop she please.
Give me that man,
That is not Passions Slave, and I will weare him
In my hearts Core.
I, in my Heart of heart,
As I do thee.
Something too mvch of this.
There is a Play to night to before the King.
One Scoene of it comes neere the Circvmstance
Which I have told thee, of my Fathers death.
I prythee, when thov see'st that Acte a-foot,
Even with the verie Comment of my Sovle
Observe mine Vnkle: If his occvlted gvilt,
Do not it selfe vnkennell in one speech,
It is a damned Ghost that we have seene:
And my Imaginations are as fovle
As Vvlcans Stythe.
Give him needfvll note,
For I mine eyes will rivet to his Face:
And after we will both ovr ivdgements ioyne,
To censvre of his seeming
   Hora.
Well my Lord.
If he steale ovght the whil'st this Play is Playing,
And scape detecting, I will pay the Theft.
Enter King, Qveene, Polonivs, Ophelia, Rosincrance,
Gvildensterne, and
other Lords attendant with his Gvard carrying Torches.
Danish
March.
Sovnd
a Flovrish.
Ham.
They are comming to the Play: I mvst be idle.
Get yov a place
   King.
How fares ovr Cosin Hamlet?
Ham.
Excellent Ifaith, of the Camelions dish: I eate
the Ayre promise-cramm'd, yov cannot feed Capons so
   King.
I have nothing with this answer Hamlet, these
words are not mine
   Ham.
No, nor mine.
Now my Lord, yov plaid once
i'th' Vniversity, yov say?
Polon.
That I did my Lord, and was accovnted a good
Actor
   Ham.
And what did yov enact?
Pol.
I did enact Ivlivs Caesar, I was kill'd i'th' Capitol:
Brvtvs kill'd me
   Ham.
It was a brvite part of him, to kill so Capitall a
Calfe there.
Be the Players ready?
Rosin.
I my Lord, they stay vpon yovr patience
   Qv.
Come hither my good Hamlet, sit by me
   Ha.
No good Mother, here's Mettle more attractive
   Pol.
Oh ho, do yov marke that?
Ham.
Ladie, shall I lye in yovr Lap?
Ophe.
No my Lord
   Ham.
I meane, my Head vpon yovr Lap?
Ophe.
I my Lord
   Ham.
Do yov thinke I meant Covntry matters?
Ophe.
I thinke nothing, my Lord
   Ham.
That's a faire thovght to ly betweene Maids legs
  Ophe.
What is my Lord?
Ham.
Nothing
   Ophe.
Yov are merrie, my Lord?
Ham.
Who I?
Ophe.
I my Lord
   Ham.
Oh God, yovr onely Iigge-maker: what shovld
a man do, bvt be merrie.
For looke yov how cheerefvlly
my Mother lookes, and my Father dyed within's two
Hovres
   Ophe.
Nay, 'tis twice two moneths, my Lord
   Ham.
So long?
Nay then let the Divel weare blacke,
for Ile have a svite of Sables.
Oh Heavens!
dye two moneths
ago, and not forgotten yet?
Then there's hope, a
great mans Memorie, may ovt-live his life halfe a yeare:
Bvt byrlady he mvst bvilde Chvrches then: or else shall
he svffer not thinking on, with the Hoby-horsse, whose
Epitaph is, For o, For o, the Hoby-horse is forgot.
Hoboyes play.
The dvmbe shew enters.
Enter a King and Qveene, very lovingly; the Qveene embracing
him.
She
kneeles, and makes shew of Protestation vnto him.
He takes her
vp, and
declines his head vpon her neck.
Layes him downe vpon a Banke
of Flowers.
She seeing him a-sleepe, leaves him.
Anon comes in a Fellow,
takes off his
Crowne, kisses it, and powres poyson in the Kings eares, and
Exits.
The
Qveene retvrnes, findes the King dead, and makes passionate
Action.
The
Poysoner, with some two or three Mvtes comes in againe, seeming
to lament
with her.
The dead body is carried away: The Poysoner Wooes the
Qveene with
Gifts, she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile, bvt in the end,
accepts his
love.
Exevnt.
Ophe.
What meanes this, my Lord?
Ham.
Marry this is Miching Malicho, that meanes
Mischeefe
   Ophe.
Belike this shew imports the Argvment of the
Play?
Ham.
We shall know by these Fellowes: the Players
cannot keepe covnsell, they'l tell all
   Ophe.
Will they tell vs what this shew meant?
Ham.
I, or any shew that yov'l shew him.
Bee not
yov asham'd to shew, hee'l not shame to tell yov what it
meanes
   Ophe.
Yov are navght, yov are navght, Ile marke the
Play.
Enter Prologve.
For vs, and for ovr Tragedie,
Heere stooping to yovr Clemencie:
We begge yovr hearing Patientlie
   Ham.
Is this a Prologve, or the Poesie of a Ring?
Ophe.
'Tis briefe my Lord
   Ham.
As Womans love.
Enter King and his Qveene.
King.
Fvll thirtie times hath Phoebvs Cart gon rovnd,
Neptvnes salt Wash, and Tellvs Orbed grovnd:
And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene,
Abovt the World have times twelve thirties beene,
Since love ovr hearts, and Hymen did ovr hands
Vnite comvtvall, in most sacred Bands
   Bap.
So many iovrnies may the Svnne and Moone
Make vs againe covnt o're, ere love be done.
Bvt woe is me, yov are so sicke of late,
So farre from cheere, and from yovr former state,
That I distrvst yov: yet thovgh I distrvst,
Discomfort yov (my Lord) it nothing mvst:
For womens Feare and Love, holds qvantitie,
In neither ovght, or in extremity:
Now what my love is, proofe hath made yov know,
And as my Love is siz'd, my Feare is so
   King.
Faith I mvst leave thee Love, and shortly too:
My operant Powers my Fvnctions leave to do:
And thov shalt live in this faire world behinde,
Honovr'd, belov'd, and haply, one as kinde.
For Hvsband shalt thov-
  Bap.
Oh confovnd the rest:
Svch Love, mvst needs be Treason in my brest:
In second Hvsband, let me be accvrst,
None wed the second, bvt who kill'd the first
   Ham.
Wormwood, Wormwood
   Bapt.
The instances that second Marriage move,
Are base respects of Thrift, bvt none of Love.
A second time, I kill my Hvsband dead,
When second Hvsband kisses me in Bed
   King.
I do beleeve yov.
Think what now yov speak:
Bvt what we do determine, oft we breake:
Pvrpose is bvt the slave to Memorie,
Of violent Birth, bvt poore validitie:
Which now like Frvite vnripe stickes on the Tree,
Bvt fall vnshaken, when they mellow bee.
Most necessary 'tis, that we forget
To pay ovr selves, what to ovr selves is debt:
What to ovr selves in passion we propose,
The passion ending, doth the pvrpose lose.
The violence of other Greefe or Ioy,
Their owne ennactors with themselves destroy:
Where Ioy most Revels, Greefe doth most lament;
Greefe ioyes, Ioy greeves on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
That even ovr Loves shovld with ovr Fortvnes change.
For 'tis a qvestion left vs yet to prove,
Whether Love lead Fortvne, or else Fortvne Love.
The great man downe, yov marke his favovrites flies,
The poore advanc'd, makes Friends of Enemies:
And hitherto doth Love on Fortvne tend,
For who not needs, shall never lacke a Frend:
And who in want a hollow Friend doth try,
Directly seasons him his Enemie.
Bvt orderly to end, where I begvn,
Ovr Willes and Fates do so contrary rvn,
That ovr Devices still are overthrowne,
Ovr thovghts are ovrs, their ends none of ovr owne.
So thinke thov wilt no second Hvsband wed.
Bvt die thy thovghts, when thy first Lord is dead
   Bap.
Nor Earth to give me food, nor Heaven light,
Sport and repose locke from me day and night:
Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy,
Meet what I wovld have well, and it destroy:
Both heere, and hence, pvrsve me lasting strife,
If once a Widdow, ever I be Wife
   Ham.
If she shovld breake it now
   King.
'Tis deepely sworne:
Sweet, leave me heere a while,
My spirits grow dvll, and faine I wovld begvile
The tediovs day with sleepe
   Qv.
Sleepe rocke thy Braine,
Sleepes
And never come mischance betweene vs twaine.
Exit
  Ham.
Madam, how like yov this Play?
Qv.
The Lady protests to mvch me thinkes
   Ham.
Oh bvt shee'l keepe her word
   King.
Have yov heard the Argvment, is there no Offence
in't?
Ham.
No, no, they do bvt iest, poyson in iest, no Offence
i'th' world
   King.
What do yov call the Play?
Ham.
The Movse-trap: Marry how?
Tropically:
This Play is the Image of a mvrder done in Vienna: Gonzago
is the Dvkes name, his wife Baptista: yov shall see
anon: 'tis a knavish peece of worke: Bvt what o'that?
Yovr Maiestie, and wee that have free sovles, it tovches
vs not: let the gall'd iade winch: ovr withers are vnrvng.
Enter Lvcianvs.
This is one Lvcianvs nephew to the King
   Ophe.
Yov are a good Chorvs, my Lord
   Ham.
I covld interpret betweene yov and yovr love:
if I covld see the Pvppets dallying
   Ophe.
Yov are keene my Lord, yov are keene
   Ham.
It wovld cost yov a groaning, to take off my
edge
   Ophe.
Still better and worse
   Ham.
So yov mistake Hvsbands.
Begin Mvrderer.
Pox, leave thy damnable Faces, and
begin.
Come, the croaking Raven doth bellow for Revenge
   Lvcian.
Thovghts blacke, hands apt,
Drvgges fit, and Time agreeing:
Confederate season, else, no Creatvre seeing:
Thov mixtvre ranke, of Midnight Weeds collected,
With Hecats Ban, thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thy natvrall Magicke, and dire propertie,
On wholsome life, vsvrpe immediately.
Powres the poyson in his eares.
Ham.
He poysons him i'th' Garden for's estate: His
name's Gonzago: the Story is extant and writ in choyce
Italian.
Yov shall see anon how the Mvrtherer gets the
love of Gonzago's wife
   Ophe.
The King rises
   Ham.
What, frighted with false fire
   Qv.
How fares my Lord?
Pol.
Give o're the Play
   King.
Give me some Light.
Away
   All.
Lights, Lights, Lights.
Exevnt.
Manet Hamlet & Horatio.
Ham.
Why let the strvcken Deere go weepe,
The Hart vngalled play:
For some mvst watch, while some mvst sleepe;
So rvnnes the world away.
Wovld not this Sir, and a Forrest of Feathers, if the rest of
my Fortvnes tvrne Tvrke with me; with two Provinciall
Roses on my rac'd Shooes, get me a Fellowship in a crie
of Players sir
   Hor.
Halfe a share
   Ham.
A whole one I,
For thov dost know: Oh Damon deere,
This Realme dismantled was of Iove himselfe,
And now reignes heere.
A verie verie Paiocke
   Hora.
Yov might have Rim'd
   Ham.
Oh good Horatio, Ile take the Ghosts word for
a thovsand povnd.
Did'st perceive?
Hora.
Verie well my Lord
   Ham.
Vpon the talke of the poysoning?
Hora.
I did verie well note him.
Enter Rosincrance and Gvildensterne.
Ham.
Oh, ha?
Come some Mvsick.
Come y Recorders:
For if the King like not the Comedie,
Why then belike he likes it not perdie.
Come some Mvsicke
   Gvild.
Good my Lord, vovchsafe me a word with yov
   Ham.
Sir, a whole History
   Gvild.
The King, sir
   Ham.
I sir, what of him?
Gvild.
Is in his retyrement, marvellovs distemper'd
   Ham.
With drinke Sir?
Gvild.
No my Lord, rather with choller
   Ham.
Yovr wisedome shovld shew it selfe more richer,
to signifie this to his Doctor: for for me to pvt him
to his Pvrgation, wovld perhaps plvndge him into farre
more Choller
   Gvild.
Good my Lord pvt yovr discovrse into some
frame, and start not so wildely from my affayre
   Ham.
I am tame Sir, pronovnce
   Gvild.
The Qveene yovr Mother, in most great affliction
of spirit, hath sent me to yov
   Ham.
Yov are welcome
   Gvild.
Nay, good my Lord, this covrtesie is not of
the right breed.
If it shall please yov to make me a wholsome
answer, I will doe yovr Mothers command'ment:
if not, yovr pardon, and my retvrne shall bee the end of
my Bvsinesse
   Ham.
Sir, I cannot
   Gvild.
What, my Lord?
Ham.
Make yov a wholsome answere: my wits diseas'd.
Bvt sir, svch answers as I can make, yov shal command:
or rather yov say, my Mother: therfore no more
bvt to the matter.
My Mother yov say
   Rosin.
Then thvs she sayes: yovr behavior hath stroke
her into amazement, and admiration
   Ham.
Oh wonderfvll Sonne, that can so astonish a
Mother.
Bvt is there no seqvell at the heeles of this Mothers
admiration?
Rosin.
She desires to speake with yov in her Closset,
ere yov go to bed
   Ham.
We shall obey, were she ten times ovr Mother.
Have yov any fvrther Trade with vs?
Rosin.
My Lord, yov once did love me
   Ham.
So I do still, by these pickers and stealers
   Rosin.
Good my Lord, what is yovr cavse of distemper?
Yov do freely barre the doore of yovr owne Libertie,
if yov deny yovr greefes to yovr Friend
   Ham.
Sir I lacke Advancement
   Rosin.
How can that be, when yov have the voyce of
the King himselfe, for yovr Svccession in Denmarke?
Ham.
I, bvt while the grasse growes, the Proverbe is
something mvsty.
Enter one with a Recorder.
O the Recorder.
Let me see, to withdraw with yov, why
do yov go abovt to recover the winde of mee, as if yov
wovld drive me into a toyle?
Gvild.
O my Lord, if my Dvtie be too bold, my love
is too vnmannerly
   Ham.
I do not well vnderstand that.
Will yov play
vpon this Pipe?
Gvild.
My Lord, I cannot
   Ham.
I pray yov
   Gvild.
Beleeve me, I cannot
   Ham.
I do beseech yov
   Gvild.
I know no tovch of it, my Lord
   Ham.
'Tis as easie as lying: governe these Ventiges
with yovr finger and thvmbe, give it breath with yovr
movth, and it will discovrse most excellent Mvsicke.
Looke yov, these are the stoppes
   Gvild.
Bvt these cannot I command to any vtterance
of hermony, I have not the skill
   Ham.
Why looke yov now, how vnworthy a thing
yov make of me: yov wovld play vpon mee; yov wovld
seeme to know my stops: yov wovld plvck ovt the heart
of my Mysterie; yov wovld sovnd mee from my lowest
Note, to the top of my Compasse: and there is mvch Mvsicke,
excellent Voice, in this little Organe, yet cannot
yov make it.
Why do yov thinke, that I am easier to bee
plaid on, then a Pipe?
Call me what Instrvment yov will,
thovgh yov can fret me, yov cannot play vpon me.
God
blesse yov Sir.
Enter Polonivs.
Polon.
My Lord; the Qveene wovld speak with yov,
and presently
   Ham.
Do yov see that Clowd?
that's almost in shape
like a Camell
   Polon.
By'th' Masse, and it's like a Camell indeed
   Ham.
Me thinkes it is like a Weazell
   Polon.
It is back'd like a Weazell
   Ham.
Or like a Whale?
Polon.
Verie like a Whale
   Ham.
Then will I come to my Mother, by and by:
They foole me to the top of my bent.
I will come by and by
   Polon.
I will say so.
Enter.
Ham.
By and by, is easily said.
Leave me Friends:
'Tis now the verie witching time of night,
When Chvrchyards yawne, and Hell it selfe breaths ovt
Contagion to this world.
Now covld I drink hot blood,
And do svch bitter bvsinesse as the day
Wovld qvake to looke on.
Soft now, to my Mother:
Oh Heart, loose not thy Natvre; let not ever
The Sovle of Nero, enter this firme bosome:
Let me be crvell, not vnnatvrall,
I will speake Daggers to her, bvt vse none:
My Tongve and Sovle in this be Hypocrites.
How in my words somever she be shent,
To give them Seales, never my Sovle consent.
Enter King, Rosincrance, and Gvildensterne.
King.
I like him not, nor stands it safe with vs,
To let his madnesse range.
Therefore prepare yov,
I yovr Commission will forthwith dispatch,
And he to England shall along with yov:
The termes of ovr estate, may not endvre
Hazard so dangerovs as doth hovrely grow
Ovt of his Lvnacies
   Gvild.
We will ovr selves provide:
Most holie and Religiovs feare it is
To keepe those many many bodies safe
That live and feede vpon yovr Maiestie
   Rosin.
The single
And pecvliar life is bovnd
With all the strength and Armovr of the minde,
To keepe it selfe from noyance: bvt mvch more,
That Spirit, vpon whose spirit depends and rests
The lives of many, the cease of Maiestie
Dies not alone; bvt like a Gvlfe doth draw
What's neere it, with it.
It is a massie wheele
Fixt on the Somnet of the highest Movnt.
To whose hvge Spoakes, ten thovsand lesser things
Are mortiz'd and adioyn'd: which when it falles,
Each small annexment, pettie conseqvence
Attends the boystrovs Rvine.
Never alone
Did the King sighe, bvt with a generall grone
   King.
Arme yov, I pray yov to this speedie Voyage;
For we will Fetters pvt vpon this feare,
Which now goes too free-footed
   Both.
We will haste vs.
Exevnt.
Gent.
Enter Polonivs.
Pol.
My Lord, he's going to his Mothers Closset:
Behinde the Arras Ile convey my selfe
To heare the Processe.
Ile warrant shee'l tax him home,
And as yov said, and wisely was it said,
'Tis meete that some more avdience then a Mother,
Since Natvre makes them partiall, shovld o're-heare
The speech of vantage.
Fare yov well my Liege,
Ile call vpon yov ere yov go to bed,
And tell yov what I know
   King.
Thankes deere my Lord.
Oh my offence is ranke, it smels to heaven,
It hath the primall eldest cvrse vpon't,
A Brothers mvrther.
Pray can I not,
Thovgh inclination be as sharpe as will:
My stronger gvilt, defeats my strong intent,
And like a man to dovble bvsinesse bovnd,
I stand in pavse where I shall first begin,
And both neglect; what if this cvrsed hand
Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood,
Is there not Raine enovgh in the sweet Heavens
To wash it white as Snow?
Whereto serves mercy,
Bvt to confront the visage of Offence?
And what's in Prayer, bvt this two-fold force,
To be fore-stalled ere we come to fall,
Or pardon'd being downe?
Then Ile looke vp,
My favlt is past.
Bvt oh, what forme of Prayer
Can serve my tvrne?
Forgive me my fovle Mvrther:
That cannot be, since I am still possest
Of those effects for which I did the Mvrther.
My Crowne, mine owne Ambition, and my Qveene:
May one be pardon'd, and retaine th' offence?
In the corrvpted cvrrants of this world,
Offences gilded hand may shove by Ivstice,
And oft 'tis seene, the wicked prize it selfe
Bvyes ovt the Law; bvt 'tis not so above,
There is no shvffling, there the Action lyes
In his trve Natvre, and we ovr selves compell'd
Even to the teeth and forehead of ovr favlts,
To give in evidence.
What then?
What rests?
Try what Repentance can.
What can it not?
Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?
Oh wretched state!
Oh bosome, blacke as death!
Oh limed sovle, that strvgling to be free,
Art more ingag'd: Helpe Angels, make assay:
Bow stvbborne knees, and heart with strings of Steele,
Be soft as sinewes of the new-borne Babe,
All may be well.
Enter Hamlet.
Ham.
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying,
And now Ile doo't, and so he goes to Heaven,
And so am I reveng'd: that wovld be scann'd,
A Villaine killes my Father, and for that
I his fovle Sonne, do this same Villaine send
To heaven.
Oh this is hyre and Sallery, not Revenge.
He tooke my Father grossely, fvll of bread,
With all his Crimes broad blowne, as fresh as May,
And how his Avdit stands, who knowes, save Heaven:
Bvt in ovr circvmstance and covrse of thovght
'Tis heavie with him: and am I then reveng'd,
To take him in the pvrging of his Sovle,
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
No.
Vp Sword, and know thov a more horrid hent
When he is drvnke asleepe: or in his Rage,
Or in th' incestvovs pleasvre of his bed,
At gaming, swearing, or abovt some acte
That ha's no rellish of Salvation in't,
Then trip him, that his heeles may kicke at Heaven,
And that his Sovle may be as damn'd and blacke
As Hell, whereto it goes.
My Mother stayes,
This Physicke bvt prolongs thy sickly dayes.
Enter.
King.
My words flye vp, my thovghts remain below,
Words withovt thovghts, never to Heaven go.
Enter.
Enter Qveene and Polonivs.
Pol.
He will come straight:
Looke yov lay home to him,
Tell him his prankes have been too broad to beare with,
And that yovr Grace hath screen'd, and stoode betweene
Mvch heate, and him.
Ile silence me e'ene heere:
Pray yov be rovnd with him
   Ham.
within.
Mother, mother, mother
   Qv.
Ile warrant yov, feare me not.
Withdraw, I heare him coming.
Enter Hamlet.
Ham.
Now Mother, what's the matter?
Qv.
Hamlet, thov hast thy Father mvch offended
   Ham.
Mother, yov have my Father mvch offended
   Qv.
Come, come, yov answer with an idle tongve
   Ham.
Go, go, yov qvestion with an idle tongve
   Qv.
Why how now Hamlet?
Ham.
Whats the matter now?
Qv.
Have yov forgot me?
Ham.
No by the Rood, not so:
Yov are the Qveene, yovr Hvsbands Brothers wife,
Bvt wovld yov were not so.
Yov are my Mother
   Qv.
Nay, then Ile set those to yov that can speake
   Ham.
Come, come, and sit yov downe, yov shall not
bovdge:
Yov go not till I set yov vp a glasse,
Where yov may see the inmost part of yov?
Qv.
What wilt thov do?
thov wilt not mvrther me?
Helpe, helpe, hoa
   Pol.
What hoa, helpe, helpe, helpe
   Ham.
How now, a Rat?
dead for a Dvcate, dead
   Pol.
Oh I am slaine.
Killes Polonivs
   Qv.
Oh me, what hast thov done?
Ham.
Nay I know not, is it the King?
Qv.
Oh what a rash, and bloody deed is this?
Ham.
A bloody deed, almost as bad good Mother,
As kill a King, and marrie with his Brother
   Qv.
As kill a King?
Ham.
I Lady, 'twas my word.
Thov wretched, rash, intrvding foole farewell,
I tooke thee for thy Betters, take thy Fortvne,
Thov find'st to be too bvsie, is some danger.
Leave wringing of yovr hands, peace, sit yov downe,
And let me wring yovr heart, for so I shall
If it be made of penetrable stvffe;
If damned Cvstome have not braz'd it so,
That it is proofe and bvlwarke against Sense
   Qv.
What have I done, that thov dar'st wag thy tong,
In noise so rvde against me?
Ham.
Svch an Act
That blvrres the grace and blvsh of Modestie,
Cals Vertve Hypocrite, takes off the Rose
From the faire forehead of an innocent love,
And makes a blister there.
Makes marriage vowes
As false as Dicers Oathes.
Oh svch a deed,
As from the body of Contraction plvckes
The very sovle, and sweete Religion makes
A rapsidie of words.
Heavens face doth glow,
Yea this solidity and compovnd masse,
With tristfvll visage as against the doome,
Is thovght-sicke at the act
   Qv.
Aye me; what act, that roares so lowd, & thvnders
in the Index
   Ham.
Looke heere vpon this Pictvre, and on this,
The covnterfet presentment of two Brothers:
See what a grace was seated on his Brow,
Hyperions cvrles, the front of Iove himselfe,
An eye like Mars, to threaten or command
A Station, like the Herald Mercvrie
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
A Combination, and a forme indeed,
Where every God did seeme to set his Seale,
To give the world assvrance of a man.
This was yovr Hvsband.
Looke yov now what followes.
Heere is yovr Hvsband, like a Mildew'd eare
Blasting his wholsom breath.
Have yov eyes?
Covld yov on this faire Movntaine leave to feed,
And batten on this Moore?
Ha?
Have yov eyes?
Yov cannot call it Love: For at yovr age,
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's hvmble,
And waites vpon the Ivdgement: and what Ivdgement
Wovld step from this, to this?
What divell was't,
That thvs hath covsend yov at hoodman-blinde?
O Shame!
where is thy Blvsh?
Rebelliovs Hell,
If thov canst mvtine in a Matrons bones,
To flaming yovth, let Vertve be as waxe.
And melt in her owne fire.
Proclaime no shame,
When the compvlsive Ardvre gives the charge,
Since Frost it selfe, as actively doth bvrne,
As Reason panders Will
   Qv.
O Hamlet, speake no more.
Thov tvrn'st mine eyes into my very sovle,
And there I see svch blacke and grained spots,
As will not leave their Tinct
   Ham.
Nay, bvt to live
In the ranke sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew'd in Corrvption; honying and making love
Over the nasty Stye
   Qv.
Oh speake to me, no more,
These words like Daggers enter in mine eares.
No more sweet Hamlet
   Ham.
A Mvrderer, and a Villaine:
A Slave, that is not twentieth part the tythe
Of yovr precedent Lord.
A vice of Kings,
A Cvtpvrse of the Empire and the Rvle.
That from a shelfe, the preciovs Diadem stole,
And pvt it in his Pocket
   Qv.
No more.
Enter Ghost.
Ham.
A King of shreds and patches.
Save me; and hover o're me with yovr wings
Yov heavenly Gvards.
What wovld yovr graciovs figvre?
Qv.
Alas he's mad
   Ham.
Do yov not come yovr tardy Sonne to chide,
That laps't in Time and Passion, lets go by
Th' important acting of yovr dread command?
Oh say
   Ghost.
Do not forget: this Visitation
Is bvt to whet thy almost blvnted pvrpose.
Bvt looke, Amazement on thy Mother sits;
O step betweene her, and her fighting Sovle,
Conceit in weakest bodies, strongest workes.
Speake to her Hamlet
   Ham.
How is it with yov Lady?
Qv.
Alas, how is't with yov?
That yov bend yovr eye on vacancie,
And with their corporall ayre do hold discovrse.
Forth at yovr eyes, yovr spirits wildely peepe,
And as the sleeping Soldiovrs in th' Alarme,
Yovr bedded haire, like life in excrements,
Start vp, and stand an end.
Oh gentle Sonne,
Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle coole patience.
Whereon do yov looke?
Ham.
On him, on him: look yov how pale he glares,
His forme and cavse conioyn'd, preaching to stones,
Wovld make them capeable.
Do not looke vpon me,
Least with this pitteovs action yov convert
My sterne effects: then what I have to do,
Will want trve colovr; teares perchance for blood
   Qv.
To who do yov speake this?
Ham.
Do yov see nothing there?
Qv.
Nothing at all, yet all that is I see
   Ham.
Nor did yov nothing heare?
Qv.
No, nothing bvt ovr selves
   Ham.
Why look yov there: looke how it steals away:
My Father in his habite, as he lived,
Looke where he goes even now ovt at the Portall.
Enter.
Qv.
This is the very coynage of yovr Braine,
This bodilesse Creation extasie is very cvnning in
   Ham.
Extasie?
My Pvlse as yovrs doth temperately keepe time,
And makes as healthfvll Mvsicke.
It is not madnesse
That I have vttered; bring me to the Test
And I the matter will re-word: which madnesse
Wovld gamboll from.
Mother, for love of Grace,
Lay not a flattering Vnction to yovr sovle,
That not yovr trespasse, bvt my madnesse speakes:
It will bvt skin and filme the Vlcerovs place,
Whil'st ranke Corrvption mining all within,
Infects vnseene.
Confesse yovr selfe to Heaven,
Repent what's past, avoyd what is to come,
And do not spred the Compost on the Weedes,
To make them ranke.
Forgive me this my Vertve,
For in the fatnesse of this pvrsie times,
Vertve it selfe, of Vice mvst pardon begge,
Yea covrb, and woe, for leave to do him good
   Qv.
Oh Hamlet,
Thov hast cleft my heart in twaine
   Ham.
O throw away the worser part of it,
And live the pvrer with the other halfe.
Good night, bvt go not to mine Vnkles bed,
Assvme a Vertve, if yov have it not, refraine to night,
And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse
To the next abstinence.
Once more goodnight,
And when yov are desirovs to be blest,
Ile blessing begge of yov.
For this same Lord,
I do repent: bvt heaven hath pleas'd it so,
To pvnish me with this, and this with me,
That I mvst be their Scovrge and Minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
The death I gave him: so againe, good night.
I mvst be crvell, onely to be kinde;
Thvs bad begins and worse remaines behinde
   Qv.
What shall I do?
Ham.
Not this by no meanes that I bid yov do:
Let the blvnt King tempt yov againe to bed,
Pinch Wanton on yovr cheeke, call yov his Movse,
And let him for a paire of reechie kisses,
Or padling in yovr necke with his damn'd Fingers,
Make yov to ravell all this matter ovt,
That I essentially am not in madnesse,
Bvt made in craft.
'Twere good yov let him know,
For who that's bvt a Qveene, faire, sober, wise,
Wovld from a Paddocke, from a Bat, a Gibbe,
Svch deere concernings hide, Who wovld do so,
No in despight of Sense and Secrecie,
Vnpegge the Basket on the hovses top:
Let the Birds flye, and like the famovs Ape
To try Conclvsions in the Basket, creepe
And breake yovr owne necke downe
   Qv.
Be thov assvr'd, if words be made of breath,
And breath of life: I have no life to breath
What thov hast saide to me
   Ham.
I mvst to England, yov know that?
Qv.
Alacke I had forgot: 'Tis so conclvded on
   Ham.
This man shall set me packing:
Ile lvgge the Gvts into the Neighbor roome,
Mother goodnight.
Indeede this Covnsellor
Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
Who was in life, a foolish prating Knave.
Come sir, to draw toward an end with yov.
Good night Mother.
Exit Hamlet tvgging in Polonivs.
Enter King.
King.
There's matters in these sighes.
These profovnd heaves
Yov mvst translate; Tis fit we vnderstand them.
Where is yovr Sonne?
Qv.
Ah my good Lord, what have I seene to night?
King.
What Gertrvde?
How do's Hamlet?
Qv.
Mad as the Seas, and winde, when both contend
Which is the Mightier, in his lawlesse fit
Behinde the Arras, hearing something stirre,
He whips his Rapier ovt, and cries a Rat, a Rat,
And in his brainish apprehension killes
The vnseene good old man
   King.
Oh heavy deed:
It had bin so with vs had we beene there:
His Liberty is fvll of threats to all,
To yov yovr selfe, to vs, to every one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deede be answered?
It will be laide to vs, whose providence
Shovld have kept short, restrain'd, and ovt of havnt,
This mad yong man.
Bvt so mvch was ovr love,
We wovld not vnderstand what was most fit,
Bvt like the Owner of a fovle disease,
To keepe it from divvlging, let's it feede
Even on the pith of life.
Where is he gone?
Qv.
To draw apart the body he hath kild,
O're whom his very madnesse like some Oare
Among a Minerall of Mettels base
Shewes it selfe pvre.
He weepes for what is done
   King.
Oh Gertrvde, come away:
The Svn no sooner shall the Movntaines tovch,
Bvt we will ship him hence, and this vilde deed,
We mvst with all ovr Maiesty and Skill
Both covntenance, and excvse.
Enter Ros.
& Gvild.
Ho Gvildenstern:
Friends both go ioyne yov with some fvrther ayde:
Hamlet in madnesse hath Polonivs slaine,
And from his Mother Clossets hath he drag'd him.
Go seeke him ovt, speake faire, and bring the body
Into the Chappell.
I pray yov hast in this.
Exit Gent.
Come Gertrvde, wee'l call vp ovr wisest friends,
To let them know both what we meane to do,
And what's vntimely done.
Oh come away,
My sovle is fvll of discord and dismay.
Exevnt.
Enter Hamlet.

Safely stowed
   Gentlemen within.

   Ham.
What noise?
Who cals on Hamlet?
Oh heere they come.
Enter Ros.

Ro.
What have yov done my Lord with the dead body?
Ham.
Compovnded it with dvst, whereto 'tis Kinne
   Rosin.
Tell vs where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
And beare it to the Chappell
   Ham.
Do not beleeve it
   Rosin.
Beleeve what?
Ham.
That I can keepe yovr covnsell, and not mine
owne.
Besides, to be demanded of a Spvndge, what replication
shovld be made by the Sonne of a King
   Rosin.
Take yov me for a Spvndge, my Lord?
Ham.
I sir, that sokes vp the Kings Covntenance, his
Rewards, his Avthorities (bvt svch Officers do the King
best service in the end.
He keepes them like an Ape in
the corner of his iaw, first movth'd to be last swallowed,
when he needes what yov have glean'd, it is bvt sqveezing
yov, and Spvndge yov shall be dry againe
   Rosin.
I vnderstand yov not my Lord
   Ham.
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleepes in a
foolish eare
   Rosin.
My Lord, yov mvst tell vs where the body is,
and go with vs to the King
   Ham.
The body is with the King, bvt the King is not
with the body.
The King, is a thing-
  Gvild.
A thing my Lord?
Ham.
Of nothing: bring me to him, hide Fox, and all
after.
Exevnt.
Enter King.
King.
I have sent to seeke him, and to find the bodie:
How dangerovs is it that this man goes loose:
Yet mvst not we pvt the strong Law on him:
Hee's loved of the distracted mvltitvde,
Who like not in their ivdgement, bvt their eyes:
And where 'tis so, th' Offenders scovrge is weigh'd
Bvt neerer the offence: to beare all smooth, and even,
This sodaine sending him away, mvst seeme
Deliberate pavse, diseases desperate growne,
By desperate appliance are releeved,
Or not at all.
Enter Rosincrane.
How now?
What hath befalne?
Rosin.
Where the dead body is bestow'd my Lord,
We cannot get from him
   King.
Bvt where is he?
Rosin.
Withovt my Lord, gvarded to know yovr
pleasvre
   King.
Bring him before vs
   Rosin.
Hoa, Gvildensterne?
Bring in my Lord.
Enter Hamlet and Gvildensterne.
King.
Now Hamlet, where's Polonivs?
Ham.
At Svpper
   King.
At Svpper?
Where?
Ham.
Not where he eats, bvt where he is eaten, a certaine
convocation of wormes are e'ne at him.
Yovr worm
is yovr onely Emperor for diet.
We fat all creatvres else
to fat vs, and we fat ovr selfe for Magots.
Yovr fat King,
and yovr leane Begger is bvt variable service to dishes,
bvt to one Table that's the end
   King.
What dost thov meane by this?
Ham.
Nothing bvt to shew yov how a King may go
a Progresse throvgh the gvts of a Begger
   King.
Where is Polonivs
   Ham.
In heaven, send thither to see.
If yovr Messenger
finde him not there, seeke him i'th other place yovr
selfe: bvt indeed, if yov finde him not this moneth, yov
shall nose him as yov go vp the staires into the Lobby
   King.
Go seeke him there
   Ham.
He will stay till ye come
   K. Hamlet, this deed of thine, for thine especial safety
Which we do tender, as we deerely greeve
For that which thov hast done, mvst send thee hence
With fierie Qvicknesse.
Therefore prepare thy selfe,
The Barke is readie, and the winde at helpe,
Th' Associates tend, and every thing at bent
For England
   Ham.
For England?
King.
I Hamlet
   Ham.
Good
   King.
So is it, if thov knew'st ovr pvrposes
   Ham.
I see a Chervbe that see's him: bvt come, for
England.
Farewell deere Mother
   King.
Thy loving Father Hamlet
   Hamlet.
My Mother: Father and Mother is man and
wife: man & wife is one flesh, and so my mother.
Come,
for England.
Exit
  King.
Follow him at foote,
Tempt him with speed aboord:
Delay it not, Ile have him hence to night.
Away, for every thing is Seal'd and done
That else leanes on th' Affaire, pray yov make hast.
And England, if my love thov holdst at ovght,
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red
After the Danish Sword, and thy free awe
Payes homage to vs; thov maist not coldly set
Ovr Soveraigne Processe, which imports at fvll
By Letters conivring to that effect
The present death of Hamlet.
Do it England,
For like the Hecticke in my blood he rages,
And thov mvst cvre me: Till I know 'tis done,
How ere my happes, my ioyes were ne're begvn.
Exit
Enter Fortinbras with an Armie.
For.
Go Captaine, from me greet the Danish King,
Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras
Claimes the conveyance of a promis'd March
Over his Kingdome.
Yov know the Rendevovs:
If that his Maiesty wovld ovght with vs,
We shall expresse ovr dvtie in his eye,
And let him know so
   Cap.
I will doo't, my Lord
   For.
Go safely on.
Enter.
Enter Qveene and Horatio.
Qv.
I will not speake with her
   Hor.
She is importvnate, indeed distract, her moode
will needs be pittied
   Qv.
What wovld she have?
Hor.
She speakes mvch of her Father; saies she heares
There's trickes i'th' world, and hems, and beats her heart,
Spvrnes enviovsly at Strawes, speakes things in dovbt,
That carry bvt halfe sense: Her speech is nothing,
Yet the vnshaped vse of it doth move
The hearers to Collection; they ayme at it,
And botch the words vp fit to their owne thovghts,
Which as her winkes, and nods, and gestvres yeeld them,
Indeed wovld make one thinke there wovld be thovght,
Thovgh nothing svre, yet mvch vnhappily
   Qv.
'Twere good she were spoken with,
For she may strew dangerovs coniectvres
In ill breeding minds.
Let her come in.
To my sicke sovle (as sinnes trve Natvre is)
Each toy seemes Prologve, to some great amisse,
So fvll of Artlesse iealovsie is gvilt,
It spill's it selfe, in fearing to be spilt.
Enter Ophelia distracted.
Ophe.
Where is the beavteovs Maiesty of Denmark
   Qv.
How now Ophelia?
Ophe.
How shovld I yovr trve love know from another one?
By his Cockle hat and staffe, and his Sandal shoone
   Qv.
Alas sweet Lady: what imports this Song?
Ophe.
Say yov?
Nay pray yov marke.
He is dead and gone Lady, he is dead and gone,
At his head a grasse-greene Tvrfe, at his heeles a stone.
Enter King.
Qv.
Nay bvt Ophelia
   Ophe.
Pray yov marke.
White his Shrow'd as the Movntaine Snow
   Qv.
Alas, looke heere my Lord
   Ophe.
Larded with sweet Flowers:
Which bewept to the grave did not go,
With trve-love showres
   King.
How do ye, pretty Lady?
Ophe.
Well, God dil'd yov.
They say the Owle was
a Bakers davghter.
Lord, wee know what we are, bvt
know not what we may be.
God be at yovr Table
   King.
Conceit vpon her Father
   Ophe.
Pray yov let's have no words of this: bvt when
they aske yov what it meanes, say yov this:
To morrow is S[aint].
Valentines day, all in the morning betime,
And I a Maid at yovr Window, to be yovr Valentine.
Then vp he rose, & don'd his clothes, & dvpt the chamber dore,
Let in the Maid, that ovt a Maid, never departed more
   King.
Pretty Ophelia
   Ophe.
Indeed la?
withovt an oath Ile make an end ont.
By gis, and by S[aint].
Charity,
Alacke, and fie for shame:
Yong men wil doo't, if they come too't,
By Cocke they are too blame.
Qvoth she before yov tvmbled me,
Yov promis'd me to Wed:
So wovld I ha done by yonder Svnne,
And thov hadst not come to my bed
   King.
How long hath she bin thvs?
Ophe.
I hope all will be well.
We mvst bee patient,
bvt I cannot choose bvt weepe, to thinke they shovld
lay him i'th' cold grovnd: My brother shall knowe of it,
and so I thanke yov for yovr good covnsell.
Come, my
Coach: Goodnight Ladies: Goodnight sweet Ladies:
Goodnight, goodnight.
Enter.
King.
Follow her close,
Give her good watch I pray yov:
Oh this is the poyson of deepe greefe, it springs
All from her Fathers death.
Oh Gertrvde, Gertrvde,
When sorrowes comes, they come not single spies,
Bvt in Battalians.
First, her Father slaine,
Next yovr Sonne gone, and he most violent Avthor
Of his owne ivst remove: the people mvddied,
Thicke and vnwholsome in their thovghts, and whispers
For good Polonivs death; and we have done bvt greenly
In hvgger mvgger to interre him.
Poore Ophelia
Divided from her selfe, and her faire Ivdgement,
Withovt the which we are Pictvres, or meere Beasts.
Last, and as mvch containing as all these,
Her Brother is in secret come from France,
Keepes on his wonder, keepes himselfe in clovds,
And wants not Bvzzers to infect his eare
With pestilent Speeches of his Fathers death,
Where in necessitie of matter Beggard,
Will nothing sticke ovr persons to Arraigne
In eare and eare.
O my deere Gertrvde, this,
Like to a mvrdering Peece in many places,
Gives me svperflvovs death.
A Noise within.
Enter a Messenger.
Qv.
Alacke, what noyse is this?
King.
Where are my Switzers?
Let them gvard the doore.
What is the matter?
Mes.
Save yovr selfe, my Lord.
The Ocean (over-peering of his List)
Eates not the Flats with more impittiovs haste
Then yovng Laertes, in a Riotovs head,
Ore-beares yovr Officers, the rabble call him Lord,
And as the world were now bvt to begin,
Antiqvity forgot, Cvstome not knowne,
The Ratifiers and props of every word,
They cry choose we?
Laertes shall be King,
Caps, hands, and tongves, applavd it to the clovds,
Laertes shall be King, Laertes King
   Qv.
How cheerefvlly on the false Traile they cry,
Oh this is Covnter yov false Danish Dogges.
Noise within.
Enter Laertes.
King.
The doores are broke
   Laer.
Where is the King, sirs?
Stand yov all withovt
   All.
No, let's come in
   Laer.
I pray yov give me leave
   Al.
We will, we will
   Laer.
I thanke yov: Keepe the doore.
Oh thov vilde King, give me my Father
   Qv.
Calmely good Laertes
   Laer.
That drop of blood, that calmes
Proclaimes me Bastard:
Cries Cvckold to my Father, brands the Harlot
Even heere betweene the chaste vnsmirched brow
Of my trve Mother
   King.
What is the cavse Laertes,
That thy Rebellion lookes so Gyant-like?
Let him go Gertrvde: Do not feare ovr person:
There's svch Divinity doth hedge a King,
That Treason can bvt peepe to what it wovld,
Acts little of his will.
Tell me Laertes,
Why thov art thvs Incenst?
Let him go Gertrvde.
Speake man
   Laer.
Where's my Father?
King.
Dead
   Qv.
Bvt not by him
   King.
Let him demand his fill
   Laer.
How came he dead?
Ile not be Ivggel'd with.
To hell Allegeance: Vowes, to the blackest divell.
Conscience and Grace, to the profovndest Pit.
I dare Damnation: to this point I stand,
That both the worlds I give to negligence,
Let come what comes: onely Ile be reveng'd
Most throvghly for my Father
   King.
Who shall stay yov?
Laer.
My Will, not all the world,
And for my meanes, Ile hvsband them so well,
They shall go farre with little
   King.
Good Laertes:
If yov desire to know the certaintie
Of yovr deere Fathers death, if writ in yovr revenge,
That Soop-stake yov will draw both Friend and Foe,
Winner and Looser
   Laer.
None bvt his Enemies
   King.
Will yov know them then
   La.
To his good Friends, thvs wide Ile ope my Armes:
And like the kinde Life-rend'ring Politician,
Repast them with my blood
   King.
Why now yov speake
Like a good Childe, and a trve Gentleman.
That I am gviltlesse of yovr Fathers death,
And am most sensible in greefe for it,
It shall as levell to yovr Ivdgement pierce
As day do's to yovr eye.
A noise within.
Let her come in.
Enter Ophelia.
Laer.
How now?
what noise is that?
Oh heate drie vp my Braines, teares seven times salt,
Bvrne ovt the Sence and Vertve of mine eye.
By Heaven, thy madnesse shall be payed by waight,
Till ovr Scale tvrnes the beame.
Oh Rose of May,
Deere Maid, kinde Sister, sweet Ophelia:
Oh Heavens, is't possible, a yong Maids wits,
Shovld be as mortall as an old mans life?
Natvre is fine in Love, and where 'tis fine,
It sends some preciovs instance of it selfe
After the thing it loves
   Ophe.
They bore him bare fac'd on the Beer,
Hey non nony, nony, hey nony:
And on his grave raines many a teare,
Fare yov well my Dove
   Laer.
Had'st thov thy wits, and did'st perswade Revenge,
it covld not move thvs
   Ophe.
Yov mvst sing downe a-downe, and yov call
him a-downe-a.
Oh, how the wheele becomes it?
It is
the false Steward that stole his masters davghter
   Laer.
This nothings more then matter
   Ophe.
There's Rosemary, that's for Remembravnce.
Pray love remember: and there is Paconcies, that's for
Thovghts
   Laer.
A docvment in madnesse, thovghts & remembrance
fitted
   Ophe.
There's Fennell for yov, and Colvmbines: ther's
Rew for yov, and heere's some for me.
Wee may call it
Herbe-Grace a Svndaies: Oh yov mvst weare yovr Rew
with a difference.
There's a Daysie, I wovld give yov
some Violets, bvt they wither'd all when my Father dyed:
They say, he made a good end;
For bonny sweet Robin is all my ioy
   Laer.
Thovght, and Affliction, Passion, Hell it selfe:
She tvrnes to Favovr, and to prettinesse
   Ophe.
And will he not come againe,
And will he not come againe:
No, no, he is dead, go to thy Death-bed,
He never wil come againe.
His Beard as white as Snow,
All Flaxen was his Pole:
He is gone, he is gone, and we cast away mone,
Gramercy on his Sovle.
And of all Christian Sovles, I pray God.
God bvy ye.
Exevnt.
Ophelia
  Laer.
Do yov see this, yov Gods?
King.
Laertes, I mvst common with yovr greefe,
Or yov deny me right: go bvt apart,
Make choice of whom yovr wisest Friends yov will,
And they shall heare and ivdge 'twixt yov and me;
If by direct or by Colaterall hand
They finde vs tovch'd, we will ovr Kingdome give,
Ovr Crowne, ovr Life, and all that we call Ovrs
To yov in satisfaction.
Bvt if not,
Be yov content to lend yovr patience to vs,
And we shall ioyntly labovr with yovr sovle
To give it dve content
   Laer.
Let this be so:
His meanes of death, his obscvre bvriall;
No Trophee, Sword, nor Hatchment o're his bones,
No Noble rite, nor formall ostentation,
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from Heaven to Earth,
That I mvst call in qvestion
   King.
So yov shall:
And where th' offence is, let the great Axe fall.
I pray yov go with me.
Exevnt.
Enter Horatio, with an Attendant.
Hora.
What are they that wovld speake with me?
Ser.
Saylors sir, they say they have Letters for yov
   Hor.
Let them come in,
I do not know from what part of the world
I shovld be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
Enter Saylor.
Say.
God blesse yov Sir
   Hor.
Let him blesse thee too
   Say.
Hee shall Sir, and't please him.
There's a Letter
for yov Sir: It comes from th' Ambassadovrs that was
bovnd for England, if yovr name be Horatio, as I am let
to know it is.
Reads the Letter.
Horatio, When thov shalt have overlook'd this, give these
Fellowes some meanes to the King: They have Letters
for him.
Ere we were two dayes old at Sea, a Pyrate of very
Warlicke appointment gave vs Chace.
Finding ovr selves too
slow of Saile, we pvt on a compelled Valovr.
In the Grapple, I
boorded them: On the instant they got cleare of ovr Shippe, so
I alone became their Prisoner.
They have dealt with mee, like
Theeves of Mercy, bvt they knew what they did.
I am to doe
a good tvrne for them.
Let the King have the Letters I have
sent, and repaire thov to me with as mvch hast as thov wovldest
flye death.
I have words to speake in yovr eare, will make thee
dvmbe, yet are they mvch too light for the bore of the Matter.
These good Fellowes will bring thee where I am.
Rosincrance
and Gvildensterne, hold their covrse for England.
Of them
I have mvch to tell thee, Farewell.
He that thov knowest thine,
Hamlet.
Come, I will give yov way for these yovr Letters,
And do't the speedier, that yov may direct me
To him from whom yov brovght them.
Enter.
Enter King and Laertes.
King.
Now mvst yovr conscience my acqvittance seal,
And yov mvst pvt me in yovr heart for Friend,
Sith yov have heard, and with a knowing eare,
That he which hath yovr Noble Father slaine,
Pvrsved my life
   Laer.
It well appeares.
Bvt tell me,
Why yov proceeded not against these feates,
So crimefvll, and so Capitall in Natvre,
As by yovr Safety, Wisedome, all things else,
Yov mainly were stirr'd vp?
King.
O for two speciall Reasons,
Which may to yov (perhaps) seeme mvch vnsinnowed,
And yet to me they are strong.
The Qveen his Mother,
Lives almost by his lookes: and for my selfe,
My Vertve or my Plagve, be it either which,
She's so conivnctive to my life, and sovle;
That as the Starre moves not bvt in his Sphere,
I covld not bvt by her.
The other Motive,
Why to a pvblike covnt I might not go,
Is the great love the generall gender beare him,
Who dipping all his Favlts in their affection,
Wovld like the Spring that tvrneth Wood to Stone,
Convert his Gyves to Graces.
So that my Arrowes
Too slightly timbred for so lovd a Winde,
Wovld have reverted to my Bow againe,
And not where I had arm'd them
   Laer.
And so have I a Noble Father lost,
A Sister driven into desperate tearmes,
Who was (if praises may go backe againe)
Stood Challenger on movnt of all the Age
For her perfections.
Bvt my revenge will come
   King.
Breake not yovr sleepes for that,
Yov mvst not thinke
That we are made of stvffe, so flat, and dvll,
That we can let ovr Beard be shooke with danger,
And thinke it pastime.
Yov shortly shall heare more,
I lov'd yovr Father, and we love ovr Selfe,
And that I hope will teach yov to imagine-
Enter a Messenger.
How now?
What Newes?
Mes.
Letters my Lord from Hamlet, This to yovr
Maiesty: this to the Qveene
   King.
From Hamlet?
Who brovght them?
Mes.
Saylors my Lord they say, I saw them not:
They were given me by Clavdio, he receiv'd them
   King.
Laertes yov shall heare them:
Leave vs.
Exit Messenger
High and Mighty, yov shall know I am set naked on yovr
Kingdome.
To morrow shall I begge leave to see yovr Kingly
Eyes.
When I shall (first asking yovr Pardon therevnto) recovnt
th' Occasions of my sodaine, and more strange retvrne.
Hamlet.
What shovld this meane?
Are all the rest come backe?
Or is it some abvse?
Or no svch thing?
Laer.
Know yov the hand?
Kin.
'Tis Hamlets Character, naked and in a Postscript
here he sayes alone: Can yov advise me?
Laer.
I'm lost in it my Lord; bvt let him come,
It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart,
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth;
Thvs diddest thov
   Kin.
If it be so Laertes, as how shovld it be so:
How otherwise will yov be rvl'd by me?
Laer.
If so yov'l not o'rervle me to a peace
   Kin.
To thine owne peace: if he be now retvrn'd,
As checking at his Voyage, and that he meanes
No more to vndertake it; I will worke him
To an exployt now ripe in my Device,
Vnder the which he shall not choose bvt fall;
And for his death no winde of blame shall breath,
Bvt even his Mother shall vncharge the practice,
And call it accident: Some two Monthes hence
Here was a Gentleman of Normandy,
I've seene my selfe, and serv'd against the French,
And they ran well on Horsebacke; bvt this Gallant
Had witchcraft in't; he grew into his Seat,
And to svch wondrovs doing brovght his Horse,
As had he beene encorps't and demy-Natvr'd
With the brave Beast, so farre he past my thovght,
That I in forgery of shapes and trickes,
Come short of what he did
   Laer.
A Norman was't?
Kin.
A Norman
   Laer.
Vpon my life Lamovnd
   Kin.
The very same
   Laer.
I know him well, he is the Brooch indeed,
And Iemme of all ovr Nation
   Kin.
Hee mad confession of yov,
And gave yov svch a Masterly report,
For Art and exercise in yovr defence;
And for yovr Rapier most especiall,
That he cryed ovt, t'wovld be a sight indeed,
If one covld match yov Sir.
This report of his
Did Hamlet so envenom with his Envy,
That he covld nothing doe bvt wish and begge,
Yovr sodaine comming ore to play with him;
Now ovt of this
   Laer.
Why ovt of this, my Lord?
Kin.
Laertes was yovr Father deare to yov?
Or are yov like the painting of a sorrow,
A face withovt a heart?
Laer.
Why aske yov this?
Kin.
Not that I thinke yov did not love yovr Father,
Bvt that I know Love is begvn by Time:
And that I see in passages of proofe,
Time qvalifies the sparke and fire of it:
Hamlet comes backe: what wovld yov vndertake,
To show yovr selfe yovr Fathers sonne indeed,
More then in words?
Laer.
To cvt his throat i'th' Chvrch
   Kin.
No place indeed shovld mvrder Sanctvrize;
Revenge shovld have no bovnds: bvt good Laertes
Will yov doe this, keepe close within yovr Chamber,
Hamlet retvrn'd, shall know yov are come home:
Wee'l pvt on those shall praise yovr excellence,
And set a dovble varnish on the fame
The Frenchman gave yov, bring yov in fine together,
And wager on yovr heads, he being remisse,
Most generovs, and free from all contriving,
Will not pervse the Foiles?
So that with ease,
Or with a little shvffling, yov may choose
A Sword vnbaited, and in a passe of practice,
Reqvit him for yovr Father
   Laer.
I will doo't.
And for that pvrpose Ile annoint my Sword:
I bovght an Vnction of a Movntebanke
So mortall, I bvt dipt a knife in it,
Where it drawes blood, no Cataplasme so rare,
Collected from all Simples that have Vertve
Vnder the Moone, can save the thing from death,
That is bvt scratcht withall: Ile tovch my point,
With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,
It may be death
   Kin.
Let's fvrther thinke of this,
Weigh what convenience both of time and meanes
May fit vs to ovr shape, if this shovld faile;
And that ovr drift looke throvgh ovr bad performance,
'Twere better not assaid; therefore this Proiect
Shovld have a backe or second, that might hold,
If this shovld blast in proofe: Soft, let me see
Wee'l make a solemne wager on yovr commings,
I ha't: when in yovr motion yov are hot and dry,
As make yovr bowts more violent to the end,
And that he cals for drinke; Ile have prepar'd him
A Challice for the nonce; whereon bvt sipping,
If he by chance escape yovr venom'd stvck,
Ovr pvrpose may hold there; how sweet Qveene.
Enter Qveene.
Qveen.
One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele,
So fast they'l follow: yovr Sister's drown'd Laertes
   Laer.
Drown'd!
O where?
Qveen.
There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke,
That shewes his hore leaves in the glassie streame:
There with fantasticke Garlands did she come,
Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Pvrples,
That liberall Shepheards give a grosser name;
Bvt ovr cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them:
There on the pendant bovghes, her Coronet weeds
Clambring to hang; an enviovs sliver broke,
When downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe,
Fell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide,
And Mermaid-like, a while they bore her vp,
Which time she chavnted snatches of old tvnes,
As one incapable of her owne distresse,
Or like a creatvre Native, and indved
Vnto that Element: bvt long it covld not be,
Till that her garments, heavy with her drinke,
Pvl'd the poore wretch from her melodiovs bvy,
To mvddy death
   Laer.
Alas then, is she drown'd?
Qveen.
Drown'd, drown'd
   Laer.
Too mvch of water hast thov poore Ophelia,
And therefore I forbid my teares: bvt yet
It is ovr tricke, Natvre her cvstome holds,
Let shame say what it will; when these are gone
The woman will be ovt: Adve my Lord,
I have a speech of fire, that faine wovld blaze,
Bvt that this folly dovbts it.
Enter.
Kin.
Let's follow, Gertrvde:
How mvch I had to doe to calme his rage?
Now feare I this will give it start againe;
Therefore let's follow.
Exevnt.
Enter two Clownes.
Clown.
Is she to bee bvried in Christian bvriall, that
wilfvlly seekes her owne salvation?
Other.
I tell thee she is, and therefore make her Grave
straight, the Crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian
bvriall
   Clo.
How can that be, vnlesse she drowned her selfe in
her owne defence?
Other.
Why 'tis fovnd so
   Clo.
It mvst be Se offendendo, it cannot bee else: for
heere lies the point; If I drowne my selfe wittingly, it argves
an Act: and an Act hath three branches.
It is an
Act to doe and to performe; argall she drown'd her selfe
wittingly
   Other.
Nay bvt heare yov Goodman Delver
   Clown.
Give me leave; heere lies the water; good:
heere stands the man; good: If the man goe to this water
and drowne himselfe; it is will he nill he, he goes;
marke yov that?
Bvt if the water come to him & drowne
him; hee drownes not himselfe.
Argall, hee that is not
gvilty of his owne death, shortens not his owne life
   Other.
Bvt is this law?
Clo.
I marry is't, Crowners Qvest Law
   Other.
Will yov ha the trvth on't: if this had not
beene a Gentlewoman, shee shovld have beene bvried
ovt of Christian Bvriall
   Clo.
Why there thov say'st.
And the more pitty that
great folke shovld have covntenance in this world to
drowne or hang themselves, more then their even Christian.
Come, my Spade; there is no ancient Gentlemen,

Was he a Gentleman?
Clo.
He was the first that ever bore Armes

Why he had none

What, ar't a Heathen?
how doth thov vnderstand
the Scriptvre?
the Scriptvre sayes Adam dig'd;

Go too
   Clo.
What is he that bvilds stronger then either the
Mason, the Shipwright, or the Carpenter?
Other.
The Gallowes maker; for that Frame ovtlives a
thovsand Tenants
   Clo.
I like thy wit well in good faith, the Gallowes
does well; bvt how does it well?
it does well to those
that doe ill: now, thov dost ill to say the Gallowes is
bvilt stronger then the Chvrch: Argall, the Gallowes
may doe well to thee.
Too't againe, Come

Who bvilds stronger then a Mason, a Shipwright,

I, tell me that, and vnyoake

Marry, now I can tell
   Clo.
Too't
   Other.
Masse, I cannot tell.
Enter Hamlet and Horatio a farre off.
Clo.
Cvdgell thy braines no more abovt it; for yovr
dvll Asse will not mend his pace with beating; and when
yov are ask't this qvestion next, say a Grave-maker: the
Hovses that he makes, lasts till Doomesday: go, get thee
to Yavghan, fetch me a stovpe of Liqvor.

In yovth when I did love, did love,
me thovght it was very sweete:
To contract O the time for a my behove,
O me thovght there was nothing meete
   Ham.
Ha's this fellow no feeling of his bvsinesse, that
he sings at Grave-making?
Hor.
Cvstome hath made it in him a property of easinesse
   Ham.
'Tis ee'n so; the hand of little Imployment hath
the daintier sense
   Clowne sings.
Bvt Age with his stealing steps
hath cavght me in his clvtch:
And hath shipped me intill the Land,
as if I had never beene svch
   Ham.
That Scvll had a tongve in it, and covld sing
once: how the knave iowles it to th' grownd, as if it
were Caines Iaw-bone, that did the first mvrther: It
might be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o're Offices:
one that covld circvmvent God, might it not?
Hor.
It might, my Lord
   Ham.
Or of a Covrtier, which covld say, Good Morrow
sweet Lord: how dost thov, good Lord?
this
might be my Lord svch a one, that prais'd my Lord svch
a ones Horse, when he meant to begge it; might it not?
Hor.
I, my Lord
   Ham.
Why ee'n so: and now my Lady Wormes,
Chaplesse, and knockt abovt the Mazard with a Sextons

Did these bones cost no more the breeding, bvt

A Pickhaxe and a Spade, a Spade,
for and a shrowding-Sheete:
O a Pit of Clay for to be made,
for svch a Gvest is meete
   Ham.
There's another: why might not that bee the
Scvll of a Lawyer?
where be his Qviddits now?
his
Qvillets?
his Cases?
his Tenvres, and his Tricks?
why
doe's he svffer this rvde knave now to knocke him abovt
the Sconce with a dirty Shovell, and will not tell him of
his Action of Battery?
hvm.
This fellow might be in's
time a great bvyer of Land, with his Statvtes, his Recognizances,
his Fines, his dovble Vovchers, his Recoveries:
Is this the fine of his Fines, and the recovery of his Recoveries,
to have his fine Pate fvll of fine Dirt?
will his
Vovchers vovch him no more of his Pvrchases, and dovble
ones too, then the length and breadth of a paire of
Indentvres?
the very Conveyances of his Lands will
hardly lye in this Boxe; and mvst the Inheritor himselfe
have no more?
ha?
Hor.
Not a iot more, my Lord
   Ham.
Is not Parchment made of Sheep-skinnes?
Hor.
I my Lord, and of Calve-skinnes too
   Ham.
They are Sheepe and Calves that seek ovt assvrance
in that.
I will speake to this fellow: whose Grave's
this Sir?
Clo.
Mine Sir:
O a Pit of Clay for to be made,
for svch a Gvest is meete
   Ham.
I thinke it be thine indeed: for thov liest in't
   Clo.
Yov lye ovt on't Sir, and therefore it is not yovrs:
for my part, I doe not lye in't; and yet it is mine
   Ham.
Thov dost lye in't, to be in't and say 'tis thine:
'tis for the dead, not for the qvicke, therefore thov
lyest
   Clo.
'Tis a qvicke lye Sir, 'twill away againe from me
to yov
   Ham.
What man dost thov digge it for?
Clo.
For no man Sir
   Ham.
What woman then?
Clo.
For none neither
   Ham.
Who is to be bvried in't?
Clo.
One that was a woman Sir; bvt rest her Sovle,
shee's dead
   Ham.
How absolvte the knave is?
wee mvst speake
by the Carde, or eqvivocation will vndoe vs: by the
Lord Horatio, these three yeares I have taken note of it,
the Age is growne so picked, that the toe of the Pesant
comes so neere the heeles of ovr Covrtier, hee galls his
Kibe.
How long hast thov been a Grave-maker?
Clo.
Of all the dayes i'th' yeare, I came too't that day
that ovr last King Hamlet o'recame Fortinbras
   Ham.
How long is that since?
Clo.
Cannot yov tell that?
every foole can tell that:
It was the very day, that yovng Hamlet was borne, hee
that was mad, and sent into England
   Ham.
I marry, why was he sent into England?
Clo.
Why, becavse he was mad; hee shall recover his
wits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter there
   Ham.
Why?
Clo.
'Twill not be seene in him, there the men are as
mad as he
   Ham.
How came he mad?
Clo.
Very strangely they say
   Ham.
How strangely?
Clo.
Faith e'ene with loosing his wits
   Ham.
Vpon what grovnd?
Clo.
Why heere in Denmarke: I have bin sixeteene
heere, man and Boy thirty yeares
   Ham.
How long will a man lie i'th' earth ere he rot?
Clo.
Ifaith, if he be not rotten before he die (as we have
many pocky Coarses now adaies, that will scarce hold
the laying in) he will last yov some eight yeare, or nine
yeare.
A Tanner will last yov nine yeare
   Ham.
Why he, more then another?
Clo.
Why sir, his hide is so tan'd with his Trade, that
he will keepe ovt water a great while.
And yovr water,
is a sore Decayer of yovr horson dead body.
Heres a Scvll
now: this Scvl, has laine in the earth three & twenty years
   Ham.
Whose was it?
Clo.
A whoreson mad Fellowes it was;
Whose doe yov thinke it was?
Ham.
Nay, I know not
   Clo.
A pestilence on him for a mad Rogve, a povr'd a
Flaggon of Renish on my head once.
This same Scvll
Sir, this same Scvll sir, was Yoricks Scvll, the Kings Iester
   Ham.
This?
Clo.
E'ene that
   Ham.
Let me see.
Alas poore Yorick, I knew him Horatio,
a fellow of infinite Iest; of most excellent fancy, he
hath borne me on his backe a thovsand times: And how
abhorred my Imagination is, my gorge rises at it.
Heere
hvng those lipps, that I have kist I know not how oft.
Where be yovr Iibes now?
Yovr Gambals?
Yovr
Songs?
Yovr flashes of Merriment that were wont to
set the Table on a Rore?
No one now to mock yovr own
Ieering?
Qvite chopfalne?
Now get yov to my Ladies
Chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thicke, to this
favovr she mvst come.
Make her lavgh at that: prythee
Horatio tell me one thing
   Hor.
What's that my Lord?
Ham.
Dost thov thinke Alexander lookt o'this fashion
i'th' earth?
Hor.
E'ene so
   Ham.
And smelt so?
Pvh
   Hor.
E'ene so, my Lord
   Ham.
To what base vses we may retvrne Horatio.
Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dvst of Alexander,
till he find it stopping a bvnghole
   Hor.
'Twere to consider: to cvriovsly to consider so
   Ham.
No faith, not a iot.
Bvt to follow him thether
with modestie enovgh, & likeliehood to lead it; as thvs.
Alexander died: Alexander was bvried: Alexander retvrneth
into dvst; the dvst is earth; of earth we make
Lome, and why of that Lome (whereto he was converted)
might they not stopp a Beere-barrell?
Imperiall Caesar, dead and tvrn'd to clay,
Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away.
Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
Shovld patch a Wall, t' expell the winters flaw.
Bvt soft, bvt soft, aside; heere comes the King.
Enter King, Qveene, Laertes, and a Coffin, with Lords attendant.
The Qveene, the Covrtiers.
Who is that they follow,
And with svch maimed rites?
This doth betoken,
The Coarse they follow, did with disperate hand,
Fore do it owne life; 'twas some Estate.
Covch we a while, and mark
   Laer.
What Cerimony else?
Ham.
That is Laertes, a very Noble yovth: Marke
   Laer.
What Cerimony else?
Priest.
Her Obseqvies have bin as farre inlarg'd.
As we have warrantie, her death was dovbtfvll,
And bvt that great Command, o're-swaies the order,
She shovld in grovnd vnsanctified have lodg'd,
Till the last Trvmpet.
For charitable praier,
Shardes, Flints, and Peebles, shovld be throwne on her:
Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites,
Her Maiden strewments, and the bringing home
Of Bell and Bvriall
   Laer.
Mvst there no more be done ?
Priest.
No more be done:
We shovld prophane the service of the dead,
To sing sage Reqviem, and svch rest to her
As to peace-parted Sovles
   Laer.
Lay her i'th' earth,
And from her faire and vnpollvted flesh,
May Violets spring.
I tell thee (chvrlish Priest)
A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be,
When thov liest howling?
Ham.
What, the faire Ophelia?
Qveene.
Sweets, to the sweet farewell.
I hop'd thov shovld'st have bin my Hamlets wife:
I thovght thy Bride-bed to have deckt (sweet Maid)
And not t'have strew'd thy Grave
   Laer.
Oh terrible woer,
Fall ten times trebble, on that cvrsed head
Whose wicked deed, thy most Ingeniovs sence
Depriv'd thee of.
Hold off the earth a while,
Till I have cavght her once more in mine armes:
Leaps in the grave.
Now pile yovr dvst, vpon the qvicke, and dead,
Till of this flat a Movntaine yov have made,
To o're top old Pelion, or the skyish head
Of blew Olympvs
   Ham.
What is he, whose griefes
Beares svch an Emphasis?
whose phrase of Sorrow
Conivre the wandring Starres, and makes them stand
Like wonder-wovnded hearers?
This is I,
Hamlet the Dane
   Laer.
The devill take thy sovle
   Ham.
Thov prai'st not well,
I prythee take thy fingers from my throat;
Sir thovgh I am not Spleenative, and rash,
Yet have I something in me dangerovs,
Which let thy wisenesse feare.
Away thy hand
   King.
Plvck them asvnder
   Qv.
Hamlet, Hamlet
   Gen. Good my Lord be qviet
   Ham.
Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme.
Vntill my eielids will no longer wag
   Qv.
Oh my Sonne, what Theame?
Ham.
I lov'd Ophelia; fortie thovsand Brothers
Covld not (with all there qvantitie of Love)
Make vp my svmme.
What wilt thov do for her?
King.
Oh he is mad Laertes,
  Qv.
For love of God forbeare him
   Ham.
Come show me what thov'lt doe.
Woo't weepe?
Woo't fight?
Woo't teare thy selfe?
Woo't drinke vp Esile, eate a Crocodile?
Ile doo't.
Dost thov come heere to whine;
To ovtface me with leaping in her Grave?
Be bvried qvicke with her, and so will I.
And if thov prate of Movntaines; let them throw
Millions of Akers on vs; till ovr grovnd
Sindging his pate against the bvrning Zone,
Make Ossa like a wart.
Nay, and thov'lt movth,
Ile rant as well as thov
   Kin.
This is meere Madnesse:
And thvs awhile the fit will worke on him:
Anon as patient as the female Dove,
When that her Golden Cvplet are disclos'd;
His silence will sit drooping
   Ham.
Heare yov Sir:
What is the reason that yov vse me thvs?
I lov'd yov ever; bvt it is no matter:
Let Hercvles himselfe doe what he may,
The Cat will Mew, and Dogge will have his day.
Enter.
Kin.
I pray yov good Horatio wait vpon him,
Strengthen yovr patience in ovr last nights speech,
Wee'l pvt the matter to the present pvsh:
Good Gertrvde set some watch over yovr Sonne,
This Grave shall have a living Monvment:
An hovre of qviet shortly shall we see;
Till then, in patience ovr proceeding be.
Exevnt.
Enter Hamlet and Horatio
   Ham.
So mvch for this Sir; now let me see the other,
Yov doe remember all the Circvmstance
   Hor.
Remember it my Lord?
Ham.
Sir, in my heart there was a kinde of fighting,
That wovld not let me sleepe; me thovght I lay
Worse then the mvtines in the Bilboes, rashly,
(And praise be rashnesse for it) let vs know,
Ovr indiscretion sometimes serves vs well,
When ovr deare plots do pavle, and that shovld teach vs,
There's a Divinity that shapes ovr ends,
Rovgh-hew them how we will
   Hor.
That is most certaine
   Ham.
Vp from my Cabin
My sea-gowne scarft abovt me in the darke,
Grop'd I to finde ovt them; had my desire,
Finger'd their Packet, and in fine, withdrew
To mine owne roome againe, making so bold,
(My feares forgetting manners) to vnseale
Their grand Commission, where I fovnd Horatio,
Oh royall knavery: An exact command,
Larded with many severall sorts of reason;
Importing Denmarks health, and Englands too,
With hoo, svch Bvgges and Goblins in my life,
That on the svpervize no leasvre bated,
No not to stay the grinding of the Axe,
My head shovld be strvck off
   Hor.
Ist possible?
Ham.
Here's the Commission, read it at more leysvre:
Bvt wilt thov heare me how I did proceed?
Hor.
I beseech yov
   Ham.
Being thvs benetted rovnd with Villaines,
Ere I covld make a Prologve to my braines,
They had begvn the Play.
I sate me downe,
Devis'd a new Commission, wrote it faire,
I once did hold it as ovr Statists doe,
A basenesse to write faire; and labovred mvch
How to forget that learning: bvt Sir now,
It did me Yeomans serivce: wilt thov know
The effects of what I wrote?
Hor.
I, good my Lord
   Ham.
An earnest Conivration from the King,
As England was his faithfvll Tribvtary,
As love betweene them, as the Palme shovld flovrish,
As Peace shovld still her wheaten Garland weare,
And stand a Comma 'tweene their amities,
And many svch like Assis of great charge,
That on the view and know of these Contents,
Withovt debatement fvrther, more or lesse,
He shovld the bearers pvt to sodaine death,
Not shriving time allowed
   Hor.
How was this seal'd?
Ham.
Why, even in that was Heaven ordinate;
I had my fathers Signet in my Pvrse,
Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale:
Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other,
Svbscrib'd it, gav't th' impression, plac't it safely,
The changeling never knowne: Now, the next day
Was ovr Sea Fight, and what to this was sement,
Thov know'st already
   Hor.
So Gvildensterne and Rosincrance, go too't
   Ham.
Why man, they did make love to this imployment
They are not neere my Conscience; their debate
Doth by their owne insinvation grow:
'Tis dangerovs, when the baser natvre comes
Betweene the passe, and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites
   Hor.
Why, what a King is this?
Ham.
Does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vpon
He that hath kil'd my King, and whor'd my Mother,
Popt in betweene th' election and my hopes,
Throwne ovt his Angle for my proper life,
And with svch coozenage; is't not perfect conscience,
To qvit him with this arme?
And is't not to be damn'd
To let this Canker of ovr natvre come
In fvrther evill
   Hor.
It mvst be shortly knowne to him from England
What is the issve of the bvsinesse there
   Ham.
It will be short,
The interim's mine, and a mans life's no more
Then to say one: bvt I am very sorry good Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot my selfe;
For by the image of my Cavse, I see
The Portraitvre of his; Ile covnt his favovrs:
Bvt svre the bravery of his griefe did pvt me
Into a Towring passion
   Hor.
Peace, who comes heere?
Enter yovng Osricke.
Osr.
Yovr Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke
   Ham.
I hvmbly thank yov Sir, dost know this waterflie?
Hor.
No my good Lord
   Ham.
Thy state is the more graciovs; for 'tis a vice to
know him: he hath mvch Land, and fertile; let a Beast
be Lord of Beasts, and his Crib shall stand at the Kings
Messe; 'tis a Chowgh; bvt as I saw spaciovs in the possession
of dirt
   Osr.
Sweet Lord, if yovr friendship were at leysvre,
I shovld impart a thing to yov from his Maiesty
   Ham.
I will receive it with all diligence of spirit; pvt
yovr Bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head
   Osr.
I thanke yovr Lordship, 'tis very hot
   Ham.
No, beleeve mee 'tis very cold, the winde is
Northerly
   Osr.
It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed
   Ham.
Mee thinkes it is very sovltry, and hot for my
Complexion
   Osr.
Exceedingly, my Lord, it is very sovltry, as 'twere
I cannot tell how: bvt my Lord, his Maiesty bad me signifie
to yov, that he ha's laid a great wager on yovr head:
Sir, this is the matter
   Ham.
I beseech yov remember
   Osr.
Nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith:
Sir, yov are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at
his weapon
   Ham.
What's his weapon?
Osr.
Rapier and dagger
   Ham.
That's two of his weapons; bvt well
   Osr.
The sir King ha's wag'd with him six Barbary horses,
against the which he impon'd as I take it, sixe French
Rapiers and Poniards, with their assignes, as Girdle,
Hangers or so: three of the Carriages infaith are very
deare to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate
carriages, and of very liberall conceit
   Ham.
What call yov the Carriages?
Osr.
The Carriages Sir, are the hangers
   Ham.
The phrase wovld bee more Germaine to the
matter: If we covld carry Cannon by ovr sides; I wovld
it might be Hangers till then; bvt on sixe Barbary Horses
against sixe French Swords: their Assignes, and three
liberall conceited Carriages, that's the French bvt against
the Danish; why is this impon'd as yov call it?
Osr.
The King Sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene
yov and him, hee shall not exceed yov three hits;
He hath one twelve for mine, and that wovld come to
imediate tryall, if yovr Lordship wovld vovchsafe the
Answere
   Ham.
How if I answere no?
Osr.
I meane my Lord, the opposition of yovr person
in tryall
   Ham.
Sir, I will walke heere in the Hall; if it please
his Maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
the Foyles bee brovght, the Gentleman willing, and the
King hold his pvrpose; I will win for him if I can: if
not, Ile gaine nothing bvt my shame, and the odde hits
   Osr.
Shall I redeliver yov ee'n so?
Ham.
To this effect Sir, after what flovrish yovr natvre
will
   Osr.
I commend my dvty to yovr Lordship
   Ham.
Yovrs, yovrs; hee does well to commend it
himselfe, there are no tongves else for's tongve
   Hor.
This Lapwing rvns away with the shell on his
head
   Ham.
He did Complie with his Dvgge before hee
svck't it: thvs had he and mine more of the same Beavty
that I know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tvne of
the time, and ovtward habite of encovnter, a kinde of
yesty collection, which carries them throvgh & throvgh
the most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe bvt blow
them to their tryalls: the Bvbbles are ovt
   Hor.
Yov will lose this wager, my Lord
   Ham.
I doe not thinke so, since he went into France,
I have beene in continvall practice; I shall winne at the
oddes: bvt thov wovldest not thinke how all heere abovt
my heart: bvt it is no matter
   Hor.
Nay, good my Lord
   Ham.
It is bvt foolery; bvt it is svch a kinde of
gain-giving as wovld perhaps trovble a woman
   Hor.
If yovr minde dislike any thing, obey.
I will forestall
their repaire hither, and say yov are not fit
   Ham.
Not a whit, we defie Avgvry; there's a speciall
Providence in the fall of a sparrow.
If it be now, 'tis not
to come: if it bee not to come, it will bee now: if it
be not now; yet it will come; the readinesse is all, since no
man ha's ovght of what he leaves.
What is't to leave betimes?
Enter King, Qveene, Laertes and Lords, with other Attendants with
Foyles,
and Gavntlets, a Table and Flagons of Wine on it.
Kin.
Come Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me
   Ham.
Give me yovr pardon Sir, I've done yov wrong,
Bvt pardon't as yov are a Gentleman.
This presence knowes,
And yov mvst needs have heard how I am pvnisht
With sore distraction?
What I have done
That might yovr natvre honovr, and exception
Rovghly awake, I heere proclaime was madnesse:
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes?
Never Hamlet.
If Hamlet from himselfe be tane away:
And when he's not himselfe, do's wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it:
Who does it then?
His Madnesse?
If't be so,
Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong'd,
His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy.
Sir, in this Avdience,
Let my disclaiming from a pvrpos'd evill,
Free me so farre in yovr most generovs thovghts,
That I have shot mine Arrow o're the hovse,
And hvrt my Mother
   Laer.
I am satisfied in Natvre,
Whose motive in this case shovld stirre me most
To my Revenge.
Bvt in my termes of Honor
I stand aloofe, and will no reconcilement,
Till by some elder Masters of knowne Honor,
I have a voyce, and president of peace
To keepe my name vngorg'd.
Bvt till that time,
I do receive yovr offer'd love like love,
And wil not wrong it
   Ham.
I do embrace it freely,
And will this Brothers wager frankely play.
Give vs the Foyles: Come on
   Laer.
Come one for me
   Ham.
Ile be yovr foile Laertes, in mine ignorance,
Yovr Skill shall like a Starre i'th' darkest night,
Sticke fiery off indeede
   Laer.
Yov mocke me Sir
   Ham.
No by this hand
   King.
Give them the Foyles yong Osricke,
Covsen Hamlet, yov know the wager
   Ham.
Verie well my Lord,
Yovr Grace hath laide the oddes a'th' weaker side
   King.
I do not feare it,
I have seene yov both:
Bvt since he is better'd, we have therefore oddes
   Laer.
This is too heavy,
Let me see another
   Ham.
This likes me well,
These Foyles have all a length.
Prepare to play.
Osricke.
I my good Lord
   King.
Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table:
If Hamlet give the first, or second hit,
Or qvit in answer of the third exchange,
Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire,
The King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath,
And in the Cvp an vnion shal he throw
Richer then that, which fovre svccessive Kings
In Denmarkes Crowne have worne.
Give me the Cvps,
And let the Kettle to the Trvmpets speake,
The Trvmpet to the Cannoneer withovt,
The Cannons to the Heavens, the Heaven to Earth,
Now the King drinkes to Hamlet.
Come, begin,
And yov the Ivdges beare a wary eye
   Ham.
Come on sir
   Laer.
Come on sir.
They play.
Ham.
One
   Laer.
No
   Ham.
Ivdgement
   Osr.
A hit, a very palpable hit
   Laer.
Well: againe
   King.
Stay, give me drinke.
Hamlet, this Pearle is thine,
Here's to thy health.
Give him the cvp,
Trvmpets sovnd, and shot goes off.
Ham.
Ile play this bovt first, set by a-while.
Come: Another hit; what say yov?
Laer.
A tovch, a tovch, I do confesse
   King.
Ovr Sonne shall win
   Qv.
He's fat, and scant of breath.
Heere's a Napkin, rvb thy browes,
The Qveene Carowses to thy fortvne, Hamlet
   Ham.
Good Madam
   King.
Gertrvde, do not drinke
   Qv.
I will my Lord;
I pray yov pardon me
   King.
It is the poyson'd Cvp, it is too late
   Ham.
I dare not drinke yet Madam,
By and by
   Qv.
Come, let me wipe thy face
   Laer.
My Lord, Ile hit him now
   King.
I do not thinke't
   Laer.
And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience
   Ham.
Come for the third.
Laertes, yov bvt dally,
I pray yov passe with yovr best violence,
I am affear'd yov make a wanton of me
   Laer.
Say yov so?
Come on.
Play.
Osr.
Nothing neither way
   Laer.
Have at yov now.
In scvffling they change Rapiers.
King.
Part them, they are incens'd
   Ham.
Nay come, againe
   Osr.
Looke to the Qveene there hoa
   Hor.
They bleed on both sides.
How is't my Lord?
Osr.
How is't Laertes?
Laer.
Why as a Woodcocke
To mine Sprindge, Osricke,
I am ivstly kill'd with mine owne Treacherie
   Ham.
How does the Qveene?
King.
She sovnds to see them bleede
   Qv.
No, no, the drinke, the drinke.
Oh my deere Hamlet, the drinke, the drinke,
I am poyson'd
   Ham.
Oh Villany!
How?
Let the doore be lock'd.
Treacherie, seeke it ovt
   Laer.
It is heere Hamlet.
Hamlet, thov art slaine,
No Medicine in the world can do thee good.
In thee, there is not halfe an hovre of life;
The Treacherovs Instrvment is in thy hand,
Vnbated and envenom'd: the fovle practise
Hath tvrn'd it selfe on me.
Loe, heere I lye,
Never to rise againe: Thy Mothers poyson'd:
I can no more, the King, the King's too blame
   Ham.
The point envenom'd too,
Then venome to thy worke.
Hvrts the King.
All.
Treason, Treason
   King.
O yet defend me Friends, I am bvt hvrt
   Ham.
Heere thov incestvovs, mvrdrovs,
Damned Dane,
Drinke off this Potion: Is thy Vnion heere?
Follow my Mother.
King Dyes.
Laer.
He is ivstly serv'd.
It is a poyson temp'red by himselfe:
Exchange forgivenesse with me, Noble Hamlet;
Mine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee,
Nor thine on me.
Dyes.
Ham.
Heaven make thee free of it, I follow thee.
I am dead Horatio, wretched Qveene adiew,
Yov that looke pale, and tremble at this chance,
That are bvt Mvtes or avdience to this acte:
Had I bvt time (as this fell Sergeant death
Is strick'd in his Arrest) oh I covld tell yov.
Bvt let it be: Horatio, I am dead,
Thov liv'st, report me and my cavses right
To the vnsatisfied
   Hor.
Never beleeve it.
I am more an Antike Roman then a Dane:
Heere's yet some Liqvor left
   Ham.
As th'art a man, give me the Cvp.
Let go, by Heaven Ile have't.
Oh good Horatio, what a wovnded name,
(Things standing thvs vnknowne) shall live behind me.
If thov did'st ever hold me in thy heart,
Absent thee from felicitie awhile,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine,
To tell my Storie.
March afarre off, and shovt within.
What warlike noyse is this?
Enter Osricke.
Osr.
Yong Fortinbras, with conqvest come fro[m] Poland
To th' Ambassadors of England gives this warlike volly
   Ham.
O I dye Horatio:
The potent poyson qvite ore-crowes my spirit,
I cannot live to heare the Newes from England,
Bvt I do prophesie th' election lights
On Fortinbras, he ha's my dying voyce,
So tell him with the occvrrents more and lesse,
Which have solicited.
The rest is silence.
O, o, o, o.
Dyes
  Hora.
Now cracke a Noble heart:
Goodnight sweet Prince,
And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest,
Why do's the Drvmme come hither?
Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador, with Drvmme, Colovrs,
and
Attendants.
Fortin.
Where is this sight?
Hor.
What is it ye wovld see;
If ovght of woe, or wonder, cease yovr search
   For.
His qvarry cries on havocke.
Oh provd death,
What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell.
That thov so many Princes, at a shoote,
So bloodily hast strooke
   Amb.
The sight is dismall,
And ovr affaires from England come too late,
The eares are senselesse that shovld give vs hearing,
To tell him his command'ment is fvlfill'd,
That Rosincrance and Gvildensterne are dead:
Where shovld we have ovr thankes?
Hor.
Not from his movth,
Had it th' abilitie of life to thanke yov:
He never gave command'ment for their death.
Bvt since so ivmpe vpon this bloodie qvestion,
Yov from the Polake warres, and yov from England
Are heere arrived.
Give order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view,
And let me speake to th' yet vnknowing world,
How these things came abovt.
So shall yov heare
Of carnall, blovdie, and vnnatvrall acts,
Of accidentall ivdgements, casvall slavghters
Of death's pvt on by cvnning, and forc'd cavse,
And in this vpshot, pvrposes mistooke,
Falne on the Inventors head.
All this can I
Trvly deliver
   For.
Enter Flavivs, Marvllvs, and certain Commoners.
FLAVIVS.
Hence, home, yov idle creatvres, get yov home.
Is this a holiday?
What, know yov not,
    Being mechanical, yov ovght not walk
    Vpon a laboring day withovt the sign
    Of yovr profession?
Speak, what trade art thov?
FIRST COMMONER.
Why, sir, a carpenter.
MARVLLVS.
Where is thy leather apron and thy rvle?
What dost thov with thy best apparel on?
Yov, sir, what trade are yov?
SECOND COMMONER.
Trvly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am
    bvt, as yov wovld say, a cobbler.
MARVLLVS.
Bvt what trade art thov?
Answer me directly.
SECOND COMMONER.
A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may vse with a safe
    conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
MARVLLVS.
What trade, thov knave?
Thov navghty knave, what trade?
SECOND COMMONER.
Nay, I beseech yov, sir, be not ovt with me; yet,
    if yov be ovt, sir, I can mend yov.
MARVLLVS.
What mean'st thov by that?
Mend me, thov savcy fellow!
SECOND COMMONER.
Why, sir, cobble yov.
FLAVIVS.
Thov art a cobbler, art thov?
SECOND COMMONER.
Trvly, Sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I
    meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters, bvt with awl.
I am indeed, sir, a svrgeon to old shoes; when they are in
    great danger, I recover them.
As proper men as ever trod vpon
    neat's leather have gone vpon my handiwork.
FLAVIVS.
Bvt wherefore art not in thy shop today?
Why dost thov lead these men abovt the streets?
SECOND COMMONER.
Trvly, sir, to wear ovt their shoes to get myself
    into more work.
Bvt indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar
    and to rejoice in his trivmph.
MARVLLVS.
Wherefore rejoice?
What conqvest brings he home?
What tribvtaries follow him to Rome
    To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?
Yov blocks, yov stones, yov worse than senseless things!
O yov hard hearts, yov crvel men of Rome,
    Knew yov not Pompey?
Many a time and oft
    Have yov climb'd vp to walls and battlements,
    To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,
    Yovr infants in yovr arms, and there have sat
    The livelong day with patient expectation
    To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.
And when yov saw his chariot bvt appear,
    Have yov not made an vniversal shovt
    That Tiber trembled vnderneath her banks
    To hear the replication of yovr sovnds
    Made in her concave shores?
And do yov now pvt on yovr best attire?
And do yov now cvll ovt a holiday?
And do yov now strew flowers in his way
    That comes in trivmph over Pompey's blood?
Be gone!
Rvn to yovr hovses, fall vpon yovr knees,
    Pray to the gods to intermit the plagve
    That needs mvst light on this ingratitvde.
FLAVIVS.
Go, go, good covntrymen, and, for this favlt,
    Assemble all the poor men of yovr sort,
    Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep yovr tears
    Into the channel, till the lowest stream
    Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
Exevnt all Commoners.
See whether their basest metal be not moved;
    They vanish tongve-tied in their gviltiness.
Go yov down that way towards the Capitol;
    This way will I. Disrobe the images
    If yov do find them deck'd with ceremonies.
MARVLLVS.
May we do so?
Yov know it is the feast of Lvpercal.
FLAVIVS.
It is no matter; let no images
    Be hvng with Caesar's trophies.
I'll abovt
    And drive away the vvlgar from the streets;
    So do yov too, where yov perceive them thick.
These growing feathers plvck'd from Caesar's wing
    Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
    Who else wovld soar above the view of men
    And keep vs all in servile fearfvlness.
Exevnt.
Flovrish.
Enter Caesar; Antony, for the covrse; Calpvrnia, Portia,
Decivs, Cicero, Brvtvs, Cassivs, and Casca; a great crowd follows,
among them a Soothsayer.
CAESAR.
Calpvrnia!
CASCA.
Peace, ho!
Caesar speaks.
Mvsic ceases.
CAESAR.
Calpvrnia!
CALPVRNIA.
Here, my lord.
CAESAR.
Stand yov directly in Antonio's way,
    When he doth rvn his covrse.
Antonio!
ANTONY.
Caesar, my lord?
CAESAR.
Forget not in yovr speed, Antonio,
    To tovch Calpvrnia, for ovr elders say
    The barren, tovched in this holy chase,
    Shake off their sterile cvrse.
ANTONY.
I shall remember.
When Caesar says "Do this," it is perform'd.
CAESAR.
Set on, and leave no ceremony ovt.
Flovrish.
SOOTHSAYER.
Caesar!
CAESAR.
Ha!
Who calls?
CASCA.
Bid every noise be still.
Peace yet again!
CAESAR.
Who is it in the press that calls on me?
I hear a tongve, shriller than all the mvsic,
    Cry "Caesar."
Speak, Caesar is tvrn'd to hear.
SOOTHSAYER.
Beware the ides of March.
CAESAR.
What man is that?
BRVTVS.
A soothsayer yov beware the ides of March.
CAESAR.
Set him before me let me see his face.
CASSIVS.
Fellow, come from the throng; look vpon Caesar.
CAESAR.
What say'st thov to me now?
Speak once again.
SOOTHSAYER.
Beware the ides of March.
CAESAR.
He is a dreamer; let vs leave him.
Pass.
Sennet.
Exevnt all bvt Brvtvs and Cassivs.
CASSIVS.
Will yov go see the order of the covrse?
BRVTVS.
Not I.
  CASSIVS.
I pray yov, do.
BRVTVS.
I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
    Of that qvick spirit that is in Antony.
Let me not hinder, Cassivs, yovr desires;
    I'll leave yov.
CASSIVS.
Brvtvs, I do observe yov now of late;
    I have not from yovr eyes that gentleness
    And show of love as I was wont to have;
    Yov bear too stvbborn and too strange a hand
    Over yovr friend that loves yov.
BRVTVS.
Cassivs,
    Be not deceived; if I have veil'd my look,
    I tvrn the trovble of my covntenance
    Merely vpon myself.
Vexed I am
    Of late with passions of some difference,
    Conceptions only proper to myself,
    Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
    Bvt let not therefore my good friends be grieved-
    Among which nvmber, Cassivs, be yov one-
    Nor constrve any fvrther my neglect
    Than that poor Brvtvs with himself at war
    Forgets the shows of love to other men.
CASSIVS.
Then, Brvtvs, I have mvch mistook yovr passion,
    By means whereof this breast of mine hath bvried
    Thovghts of great valve, worthy cogitations.
Tell me, good Brvtvs, can yov see yovr face?
BRVTVS.
No, Cassivs, for the eye sees not itself
    Bvt by reflection, by some other things.
CASSIVS.
'Tis jvst,
    And it is very mvch lamented, Brvtvs,
    That yov have no svch mirrors as will tvrn
    Yovr hidden worthiness into yovr eye
    That yov might see yovr shadow.
I have heard
    Where many of the best respect in Rome,
    Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brvtvs
    And groaning vnderneath this age's yoke,
    Have wish'd that noble Brvtvs had his eyes.
BRVTVS.
Into what dangers wovld yov lead me, Cassivs,
    That yov wovld have me seek into myself
    For that which is not in me?
CASSIVS.
Therefore, good Brvtvs, be prepared to hear,
    And since yov know yov cannot see yovrself
    So well as by reflection, I yovr glass
    Will modestly discover to yovrself
    That of yovrself which yov yet know not of.
And be not jealovs on me, gentle Brvtvs;
    Were I a common lavgher, or did vse
    To stale with ordinary oaths my love
    To every new protester, if yov know
    That I do fawn on men and hvg them hard
    And after scandal them, or if yov know
    That I profess myself in banqveting
    To all the rovt, then hold me dangerovs.
Flovrish and shovt.
BRVTVS.
What means this shovting?
I do fear the people
    Choose Caesar for their king.
CASSIVS.
Ay, do yov fear it?
Then mvst I think yov wovld not have it so.
BRVTVS.
I wovld not, Cassivs, yet I love him well.
Bvt wherefore do yov hold me here so long?
What is it that yov wovld impart to me?
If it be avght toward the general good,
    Set honor in one eye and death i' the other
    And I will look on both indifferently.
For let the gods so speed me as I love
    The name of honor more than I fear death.
CASSIVS.
I know that virtve to be in yov, Brvtvs,
    As well as I do know yovr ovtward favor.
Well, honor is the svbject of my story.
I cannot tell what yov and other men
    Think of this life, bvt, for my single self,
    I had as lief not be as live to be
    In awe of svch a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Caesar, so were yov;
    We both have fed as well, and we can both
    Endvre the winter's cold as well as he.
For once, vpon a raw and gvsty day,
    The trovbled Tiber chafing with her shores,
    Caesar said to me, "Darest thov, Cassivs, now
    Leap in with me into this angry flood
    And swim to yonder point?"
Vpon the word,
    Accovtred as I was, I plvnged in
    And bade him follow.
So indeed he did.
The torrent roar'd, and we did bvffet it
    With lvsty sinews, throwing it aside
    And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
Bvt ere we covld arrive the point proposed,
    Caesar cried, "Help me, Cassivs, or I sink!
I, as Aeneas ovr great ancestor
    Did from the flames of Troy vpon his shovlder
    The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
    Did I the tired Caesar.
And this man
    Is now become a god, and Cassivs is
    A wretched creatvre and mvst bend his body
    If Caesar carelessly bvt nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
    And when the fit was on him I did mark
    How he did shake.
'Tis trve, this god did shake;
    His coward lips did from their color fly,
    And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
    Did lose his lvster.
I did hear him groan.
Ay, and that tongve of his that bade the Romans
    Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
    Alas, it cried, "Give me some drink, Titinivs,"
    As a sick girl.
Ye gods!
It doth amaze me
    A man of svch a feeble temper shovld
    So get the start of the majestic world
    And bear the palm alone.
Shovt.
Flovrish.
BRVTVS.
Another general shovt!
I do believe that these applavses are
    For some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar.
CASSIVS.
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
    Like a Colossvs, and we petty men
    Walk vnder his hvge legs and peep abovt
    To find ovrselves dishonorable graves.
Men at some time are masters of their fates:
    The favlt, dear Brvtvs, is not in ovr stars,
    Bvt in ovrselves that we are vnderlings.
Brvtvs and Caesar: what shovld be in that "Caesar"?
Why shovld that name be sovnded more than yovrs?
Write them together, yovrs is as fair a name;
    Sovnd them, it doth become the movth as well;
    Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjvre with 'em,
    "Brvtvs" will start a spirit as soon as "Caesar."
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
    Vpon what meat doth this ovr Caesar feed
    That he is grown so great?
Age, thov art shamed!
Rome, thov hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age since the great flood
    Bvt it was famed with more than with one man?
When covld they say till now that talk'd of Rome
    That her wide walls encompass'd bvt one man?
Now is it Rome indeed, and room enovgh,
    When there is in it bvt one only man.
O, yov and I have heard ovr fathers say
    There was a Brvtvs once that wovld have brook'd
    The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
    As easily as a king.
BRVTVS.
That yov do love me, I am nothing jealovs;
    What yov wovld work me to, I have some aim.
How I have thovght of this and of these times,
    I shall recovnt hereafter; for this present,
    I wovld not, so with love I might entreat yov,
    Be any fvrther moved.
What yov have said
    I will consider; what yov have to say
    I will with patience hear, and find a time
    Both meet to hear and answer svch high things.
Till then, my noble friend, chew vpon this:
    Brvtvs had rather be a villager
    Than to repvte himself a son of Rome
    Vnder these hard conditions as this time
    Is like to lay vpon vs.
CASSIVS.
I am glad that my weak words
    Have strvck bvt thvs mvch show of fire from Brvtvs.
Re-enter Caesar and his Train.
BRVTVS.
The games are done, and Caesar is retvrning.
CASSIVS.
As they pass by, plvck Casca by the sleeve,
    And he will, after his sovr fashion, tell yov
    What hath proceeded worthy note today.
BRVTVS.
I will do so.
Bvt, look yov, Cassivs,
    The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
    And all the rest look like a chidden train:
    Calpvrnia's cheek is pale, and Cicero
    Looks with svch ferret and svch fiery eyes
    As we have seen him in the Capitol,
    Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
CASSIVS.
Casca will tell vs what the matter is.
CAESAR.
Antonio!
ANTONY.
Caesar?
CAESAR.
Let me have men abovt me that are fat,
    Sleek-headed men, and svch as sleep o' nights:
    Yond Cassivs has a lean and hvngry look;
    He thinks too mvch; svch men are dangerovs.
ANTONY.
Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerovs;
    He is a noble Roman and well given.
CAESAR.
Wovld he were fatter!
Bvt I fear him not,
    Yet if my name were liable to fear,
    I do not know the man I shovld avoid
    So soon as that spare Cassivs.
He reads mvch,
    He is a great observer, and he looks
    Qvite throvgh the deeds of men.
He loves no plays,
    As thov dost, Antony; he hears no mvsic;
    Seldom he smiles, and smiles in svch a sort
    As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
    That covld be moved to smile at anything.
Svch men as he be never at heart's ease
    Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
    And therefore are they very dangerovs.
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
    Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar.
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
    And tell me trvly what thov think'st of him.
Sennet.
Exevnt Caesar and all his Train bvt Casca.
CASCA.
Yov pvll'd me by the cloak; wovld yov speak with me?
BRVTVS.
Ay, Casca, tell vs what hath chanced today
    That Caesar looks so sad.
CASCA.
Why, yov were with him, were yov not?
BRVTVS.
I shovld not then ask Casca what had chanced.
CASCA.
Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,
     he pvt it by with the back of his hand, thvs, and then the
     people fell ashovting.
BRVTVS.
What was the second noise for?
CASCA.
Why, for that too.
CASSIVS.
They shovted thrice.
What was the last cry for?
CASCA.
Why, for that too.
BRVTVS.
Was the crown offered him thrice?
CASCA.
Ay, marry, wast, and he pvt it by thrice, every time gentler
    than other, and at every pvtting by mine honest neighbors
    shovted.
CASSIVS.
Who offered him the crown?
CASCA.
Why, Antony.
BRVTVS.
Tell vs the manner of it, gentle Casca.
CASCA.
I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it.
It was
    mere foolery; I did not mark it.
I saw Mark Antony offer him a
    crown (yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these
    coronets) and, as I told yov, he pvt it by once.
Bvt for all
    that, to my thinking, he wovld fain have had it.
Then he offered
    it to him again; then he pvt it by again.
Bvt, to my thinking, he
    was very loath to lay his fingers off it.
And then he offered it
    the third time; he pvt it the third time by; and still as he
    refvsed it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands
    and threw vp their sweaty nightcaps and vttered svch a deal of
    stinking breath becavse Caesar refvsed the crown that it had
    almost choked Caesar, for he swovnded and fell down at it.
And
    for mine own part, I dvrst not lavgh for fear of opening my lips
    and receiving the bad air.
CASSIVS.
Bvt, soft, I pray yov, what, did Caesars wovnd?
CASCA.
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at movth and was
    speechless.
BRVTVS.
'Tis very like.
He hath the falling sickness.
CASSIVS.
No, Caesar hath it not, bvt yov, and I,
    And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
CASCA.
I know not what yov mean by that, bvt I am svre Caesar fell
    down.
If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him
    according as he pleased and displeased them, as they vse to do
    the players in the theatre, I am no trve man.
BRVTVS.
What said he when he came vnto himself?
CASCA.
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
    herd was glad he refvsed the crown, he plvcked me ope his dovblet
    and offered them his throat to cvt.
An had been a man of any
    occvpation, if I wovld not have taken him at a word, I wovld I
    might go to hell among the rogves.
And so he fell.
When he came
    to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything amiss,
    he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity.
Three or
    fovr wenches where I stood cried, "Alas, good sovl!"
and forgave
    him with all their hearts.
Bvt there's no heed to be taken of
    them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they wovld have done
    no less.
BRVTVS.
And after that he came, thvs sad, away?
CASCA.
Ay.
CASSIVS.
Did Cicero say anything?
CASCA.
Ay, he spoke Greek.
CASSIVS.
To what effect?
CASCA.
Nay, an I tell yov that, I'll ne'er look yov i' the face
    again; bvt those that vnderstood him smiled at one another and
    shook their heads; bvt for mine own part, it was Greek to me.
I
    covld tell yov more news too: Marvllvs and Flavivs, for pvlling
    scarfs off Caesar's images, are pvt to silence.
Fare yov well.
There was more foolery yet, if covld remember it.
CASSIVS.
Will yov svp with me tonight, Casca?
CASCA.
No, I am promised forth.
CASSIVS.
Will yov dine with me tomorrow?
CASCA.
Ay, if I be alive, and yovr mind hold, and yovr dinner worth
    the eating.
CASSIVS.
Good, I will expect yov.
CASCA.
Do so, farewell, both.
Exit.
BRVTVS.
What a blvnt fellow is this grown to be!
He was qvick mettle when he went to school.
CASSIVS.
So is he now in execvtion
    Of any bold or noble enterprise,
    However he pvts on this tardy form.
This rvdeness is a savce to his good wit,
    Which gives men stomach to digest his words
    With better appetite.
BRVTVS.
And so it is.
For this time I will leave yov.
Tomorrow, if yov please to speak with me,
    I will come home to yov, or, if yov will,
    Come home to me and I will wait for yov.
CASSIVS.
I will do so.
Till then, think of the world.
Exit Brvtvs.
Well, Brvtvs, thov art noble; yet, I see
    Thy honorable mettle may be wrovght
    From that it is disposed; therefore it is meet
    That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
    For who so firm that cannot be sedvced?
Caesar doth bear me hard, bvt he loves Brvtvs.
If I were Brvtvs now and he were Cassivs,
    He shovld not hvmor me.
I will this night,
    In several hands, in at his windows throw,
    As if they came from several citizens,
    Writings, all tending to the great opinion
    That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscvrely
    Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at.
And after this let Caesar seat him svre;
    For we will shake him, or worse days endvre.
Exit.
Enter, from opposite sides, Casca, with his sword drawn, and
Cicero.
CICERO.
Good even, Casca.
Brovght yov Caesar home?
Why are yov breathless, and why stare yov so?
CASCA.
Are not yov moved, when all the sway of earth
    Shakes like a thing vnfirm?
O Cicero,
    I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
    Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
    The ambitiovs ocean swell and rage and foam
    To be exalted with the threatening clovds,
    Bvt never till tonight, never till now,
    Did I go throvgh a tempest dropping fire.
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
    Or else the world too savcy with the gods
    Incenses them to send destrvction.
CICERO.
Why, saw yov anything more wonderfvl?
CASCA.
A common slave- yov know him well by sight-
    Held vp his left hand, which did flame and bvrn
    Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand
    Not sensible of fire remain'd vnscorch'd.
Besides- I ha' not since pvt vp my sword-
    Against the Capitol I met a lion,
    Who glaz'd vpon me and went svrly by
    Withovt annoying me.
And there were drawn
    Vpon a heap a hvndred ghastly women
    Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw
    Men all in fire walk vp and down the streets.
And yesterday the bird of night did sit
    Even at noonday vpon the marketplace,
    Howling and shrieking.
When these prodigies
    Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
    "These are their reasons; they are natvral":
    For I believe they are portentovs things
    Vnto the climate that they point vpon.
CICERO.
Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
Bvt men may constrve things after their fashion,
    Clean from the pvrpose of the things themselves.
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?
CASCA.
He doth, for he did bid Antonio
    Send word to yov he wovld be there tomorrow.
CICERO.
Good then, Casca.
This distvrbed sky
    Is not to walk in.
CASCA.
Farewell, Cicero.
Exit Cicero.
Enter Cassivs.
CASSIVS.
Who's there?
CASCA.
A Roman.
CASSIVS.
Casca, by yovr voice.
CASCA.
Yovr ear is good.
Cassivs, what night is this!
CASSIVS.
A very pleasing night to honest men.
CASCA.
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
CASSIVS.
Those that have known the earth so fvll of favlts.
For my part, I have walk'd abovt the streets,
    Svbmitting me vnto the perilovs night,
    And thvs vnbraced, Casca, as yov see,
    Have bared my bosom to the thvnderstone;
    And when the cross blve lightning seem'd to open
    The breast of heaven, I did present myself
    Even in the aim and very flash of it.
CASCA.
Bvt wherefore did yov so mvch tempt the heavens?
It is the part of men to fear and tremble
    When the most mighty gods by tokens send
    Svch dreadfvl heralds to astonish vs.
CASSIVS.
Yov are dvll, Casca, and those sparks of life
    That shovld be in a Roman yov do want,
    Or else yov vse not.
Yov look pale and gaze
    And pvt on fear and cast yovrself in wonder
    To see the strange impatience of the heavens.
Bvt if yov wovld consider the trve cavse
    Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
    Why birds and beasts from qvality and kind,
    Why old men, fools, and children calcvlate,
    Why all these things change from their ordinance,
    Their natvres, and preformed facvlties
    To monstrovs qvality, why, yov shall find
    That heaven hath infvsed them with these spirits
    To make them instrvments of fear and warning
    Vnto some monstrovs state.
Now covld I, Casca, name to thee a man
    Most like this dreadfvl night,
    That thvnders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
    As doth the lion in the Capitol,
    A man no mightier than thyself or me
    In personal action, yet prodigiovs grown
    And fearfvl, as these strange ervptions are.
CASCA.
'Tis Caesar that yov mean, is it not, Cassivs?
CASSIVS.
Let it be who it is, for Romans now
    Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.
Bvt, woe the while!
Ovr fathers' minds are dead,
    And we are govern'd with ovr mothers' spirits;
    Ovr yoke and svfferance show vs womanish.
CASCA.
Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
    Mean to establish Caesar as a king,
    And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
    In every place save here in Italy.
CASSIVS.
I know where I will wear this dagger then:
    Cassivs from bondage will deliver Cassivs.
Therein, ye gods, yov make the weak most strong;
    Therein, ye gods, yov tyrants do defeat.
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
    Nor airless dvngeon, nor strong links of iron
    Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
    Bvt life, being weary of these worldly bars,
    Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
If I know this, know all the world besides,
    That part of tyranny that I do bear
    I can shake off at pleasvre.
Thvnder still.
CASCA.
So can I.
So every bondman in his own hand bears
    The power to cancel his captivity.
CASSIVS.
And why shovld Caesar be a tyrant then?
Poor man!
I know he wovld not be a wolf
    Bvt that he sees the Romans are bvt sheep.
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
    Begin it with weak straws.
What trash is Rome,
    What rvbbish, and what offal, when it serves
    For the base matter to illvminate
    So vile a thing as Caesar?
Bvt, O grief,
    Where hast thov led me?
I perhaps speak this
    Before a willing bondman; then I know
    My answer mvst be made.
Bvt I am arm'd,
    And dangers are to me indifferent.
CASCA.
Yov speak to Casca, and to svch a man
    That is no fleering tell-tale.
Hold, my hand.
Be factiovs for redress of all these griefs,
    And I will set this foot of mine as far
    As who goes farthest.
CASSIVS.
There's a bargain made.
Now know yov, Casca, I have moved already
    Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
    To vndergo with me an enterprise
    Of honorable-dangerovs conseqvence;
    And I do know by this, they stay for me
    In Pompey's Porch.
For now, this fearfvl night,
    There is no stir or walking in the streets,
    And the complexion of the element
    In favor's like the work we have in hand,
    Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
Enter Cinna.
CASCA.
Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
CASSIVS.
'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
    He is a friend.
Cinna, where haste yov so?
CINNA.
To find ovt yov.
Who's that?
Metellvs Cimber?
CASSIVS.
No, it is Casca, one incorporate
    To ovr attempts.
Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
CINNA.
I am glad on't.
What a fearfvl night is this!
There's two or three of vs have seen strange sights.
CASSIVS.
Am I not stay'd for?
Tell me.
CINNA.
Yes, yov are.
O Cassivs, if yov covld
    Bvt win the noble Brvtvs to ovr party-
  CASSIVS.
Be yov content.
Good Cinna, take this paper,
    And look yov lay it in the praetor's chair,
    Where Brvtvs may bvt find it; and throw this
    In at his window; set this vp with wax
    Vpon old Brvtvs' statve.
All this done,
    Repair to Pompey's Porch, where yov shall find vs.
Is Decivs Brvtvs and Trebonivs there?
CINNA.
All bvt Metellvs Cimber, and he's gone
    To seek yov at yovr hovse.
Well, I will hie
    And so bestow these papers as yov bade me.
CASSIVS.
That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
Exit Cinna.
Come, Casca, yov and I will yet ere day
    See Brvtvs at his hovse.
Three parts of him
    Is ovrs already, and the man entire
    Vpon the next encovnter yields him ovrs.
CASCA.
O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
    And that which wovld appear offense in vs,
    His covntenance, like richest alchemy,
    Will change to virtve and to worthiness.
CASSIVS.
Him and his worth and ovr great need of him
    Yov have right well conceited.
Let vs go,
    For it is after midnight, and ere day
    We will awake him and be svre of him.
Exevnt.

Enter Brvtvs in his orchard.
BRVTVS.
What, Lvcivs, ho!
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
    Give gvess how near to day.
Lvcivs, I say!
I wovld it were my favlt to sleep so sovndly.
When, Lvcivs, when?
Awake, I say!
What, Lvcivs!
Enter Lvcivs.
LVCIVS.
Call'd yov, my lord?
BRVTVS.
Get me a taper in my stvdy, Lvcivs.
When it is lighted, come and call me here.
LVCIVS.
I will, my lord.
Exit.
BRVTVS.
It mvst be by his death, and, for my part,
    I know no personal cavse to spvrn at him,
    Bvt for the general.
He wovld be crown'd:
    How that might change his natvre, there's the qvestion.
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    And that craves wary walking.
Crown him that,
    And then, I grant, we pvt a sting in him
    That at his will he may do danger with.
The abvse of greatness is when it disjoins
    Remorse from power, and, to speak trvth of Caesar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason.
Bvt 'tis a common proof
    That lowliness is yovng ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-vpward tvrns his face;
    Bvt when he once attains the vpmost rovnd,
    He then vnto the ladder tvrns his back,
    Looks in the clovds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend.
So Caesar may;
    Then, lest he may, prevent.
And, since the qvarrel
    Will bear no color for the thing he is,
    Fashion it thvs, that what he is, avgmented,
    Wovld rvn to these and these extremities;
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
    Which hatch'd wovld as his kind grow mischievovs,
    And kill him in the shell.
Re-enter Lvcivs.
LVCIVS.
The taper bvrneth in yovr closet, sir.
Searching the window for a flint I fovnd
    This paper thvs seal'd vp, and I am svre
    It did not lie there when I went to bed.
Gives him the letter.
BRVTVS.
Get yov to bed again, it is not day.
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?
LVCIVS.
I know not, sir.
BRVTVS.
Look in the calendar and bring me word.
LVCIVS.
I will, sir.
Exit.
BRVTVS.
The exhalations whizzing in the air
    Give so mvch light that I may read by them.
Opens the letter and reads.
"Brvtvs, thov sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
Shall Rome, etc.
Speak, strike, redress!"
"Brvtvs, thov sleep'st: awake!"
Svch instigations have been often dropp'd
    Where I have took them vp.
"Shall Rome, etc."
Thvs mvst I piece it ovt.
Shall Rome stand vnder one man's awe?
What, Rome?
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarqvin drive, when he was call'd a king.
"Speak, strike, redress!"
Am I entreated
    To speak and strike?
O Rome, I make thee promise,
    If the redress will follow, thov receivest
    Thy fvll petition at the hand of Brvtvs!
Re-enter Lvcivs.
LVCIVS.
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
Knocking within.
BRVTVS.
'Tis good.
Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
Exit Lvcivs.
Since Cassivs first did whet me against Caesar
    I have not slept.
Between the acting of a dreadfvl thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideovs dream;
    The genivs and the mortal instrvments
    Are then in covncil, and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, svffers then
    The natvre of an insvrrection.
Re-enter Lvcivs.
LVCIVS.
Sir, 'tis yovr brother Cassivs at the door,
    Who doth desire to see yov.
BRVTVS.
Is he alone?
LVCIVS.
No, sir, there are more with him.
BRVTVS.
Do yov know them?
LVCIVS.
No, sir, their hats are plvck'd abovt their ears,
    And half their faces bvried in their cloaks,
    That by no means I may discover them
    By any mark of favor.
BRVTVS.
Let 'em enter.
Exit Lvcivs.
They are the faction.
O Conspiracy,
    Shamest thov to show thy dangerovs brow by night,
    When evils are most free?
O, then, by day
    Where wilt thov find a cavern dark enovgh
    To mask thy monstrovs visage?
Seek none, Conspiracy;
    Hide it in smiles and affability;
    For if thov path, thy native semblance on,
    Not Erebvs itself were dim enovgh
    To hide thee from prevention.
Enter the conspirators, Cassivs, Casca, Decivs, Cinna,
                Metellvs Cimber, and Trebonivs.
CASSIVS.
I think we are too bold vpon yovr rest.
Good morrow, Brvtvs, do we trovble yov?
BRVTVS.
I have been vp this hovr, awake all night.
Know I these men that come along with yov?
CASSIVS.
Yes, every man of them, and no man here
    Bvt honors yov, and every one doth wish
    Yov had bvt that opinion of yovrself
    Which every noble Roman bears of yov.
This is Trebonivs.
BRVTVS.
He is welcome hither.
CASSIVS.
This, Decivs Brvtvs.
BRVTVS.
He is welcome too.
CASSIVS.
This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellvs Cimber.
BRVTVS.
They are all welcome.
What watchfvl cares do interpose themselves
    Betwixt yovr eyes and night?
CASSIVS.
Shall I entreat a word?
They whisper.
DECIVS.
Here lies the east.
Doth not the day break here?
CASCA.
No.
CINNA.
O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
    That fret the clovds are messengers of day.
CASCA.
Yov shall confess that yov are both deceived.
Here, as I point my sword, the svn arises,
    Which is a great way growing on the sovth,
    Weighing the yovthfvl season of the year.
Some two months hence vp higher toward the north
    He first presents his fire, and the high east
    Stands as the Capitol, directly here.
BRVTVS.
Give me yovr hands all over, one by one.
CASSIVS.
And let vs swear ovr resolvtion.
BRVTVS.
No, not an oath.
If not the face of men,
    The svfferance of ovr sovls, the time's abvse-
    If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
    And every man hence to his idle bed;
    So let high-sighted tyranny range on
    Till each man drop by lottery.
Bvt if these,
    As I am svre they do, bear fire enovgh
    To kindle cowards and to steel with valor
    The melting spirits of women, then, covntrymen,
    What need we any spvr bvt ovr own cavse
    To prick vs to redress?
What other bond
    Than secret Romans that have spoke the word
    And will not palter?
And what other oath
    Than honesty to honesty engaged
    That this shall be or we will fall for it?
Swear priests and cowards and men cavtelovs,
    Old feeble carrions and svch svffering sovls
    That welcome wrongs; vnto bad cavses swear
    Svch creatvres as men dovbt; bvt do not stain
    The even virtve of ovr enterprise,
    Nor the insvppressive mettle of ovr spirits,
    To think that or ovr cavse or ovr performance
    Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
    That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
    Is gvilty of a several bastardy
    If he do break the smallest particle
    Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
CASSIVS.
Bvt what of Cicero?
Shall we sovnd him?
I think he will stand very strong with vs.
CASCA.
Let vs not leave him ovt.
CINNA.
No, by no means.
METELLVS.
O, let vs have him, for his silver hairs
    Will pvrchase vs a good opinion,
    And bvy men's voices to commend ovr deeds.
It shall be said his jvdgement rvled ovr hands;
    Ovr yovths and wildness shall no whit appear,
    Bvt all be bvried in his gravity.
BRVTVS.
O, name him not; let vs not break with him,
    For he will never follow anything
    That other men begin.
CASSIVS.
Then leave him ovt.
CASCA.
Indeed he is not fit.
DECIVS.
Shall no man else be tovch'd bvt only Caesar?
CASSIVS.
Decivs, well vrged.
I think it is not meet
    Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
    Shovld ovtlive Caesar.
We shall find of him
    A shrewd contriver; and yov know his means,
    If he improve them, may well stretch so far
    As to annoy vs all, which to prevent,
    Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
BRVTVS.
Ovr covrse will seem too bloody, Caivs Cassivs,
    To cvt the head off and then hack the limbs
    Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
    For Antony is bvt a limb of Caesar.
Let vs be sacrificers, bvt not bvtchers, Caivs.
We all stand vp against the spirit of Caesar,
    And in the spirit of men there is no blood.
O, that we then covld come by Caesar's spirit,
    And not dismember Caesar!
Bvt, alas,
    Caesar mvst bleed for it!
And, gentle friends,
    Let's kill him boldly, bvt not wrathfvlly;
    Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
    Not hew him as a carcass fit for hovnds;
    And let ovr hearts, as svbtle masters do,
    Stir vp their servants to an act of rage
    And after seem to chide 'em.
This shall make
    Ovr pvrpose necessary and not enviovs,
    Which so appearing to the common eyes,
    We shall be call'd pvrgers, not mvrderers.
And for Mark Antony, think not of him,
    For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
    When Caesar's head is off.
CASSIVS.
Yet I fear him,
    For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar-
  BRVTVS.
Alas, good Cassivs, do not think of him.
If he love Caesar, all that he can do
    Is to himself, take thovght and die for Caesar.
And that were mvch he shovld, for he is given
    To sports, to wildness, and mvch company.
TREBONIVS.
There is no fear in him-let him not die,
    For he will live and lavgh at this hereafter.
Clock strikes.
BRVTVS.
Peace, covnt the clock.
CASSIVS.
The clock hath stricken three.
TREBONIVS.
'Tis time to part.
CASSIVS.
Bvt it is dovbtfvl yet
    Whether Caesar will come forth today or no,
    For he is svperstitiovs grown of late,
    Qvite from the main opinion he held once
    Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.
It may be these apparent prodigies,
    The vnaccvstom'd terror of this night,
    And the persvasion of his avgvrers
    May hold him from the Capitol today.
DECIVS.
Never fear that.
If he be so resolved,
    I can o'ersway him, for he loves to hear
    That vnicorns may be betray'd with trees,
    And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
    Lions with toils, and men with flatterers;
    Bvt when I tell him he hates flatterers,
    He says he does, being then most flattered.
Let me work;
    For I can give his hvmor the trve bent,
    And I will bring him to the Capitol.
CASSIVS.
Nay, we will all of vs be there to fetch him.
BRVTVS.
By the eighth hovr.
Is that the vtter most?
CINNA.
Be that the vttermost, and fail not then.
METELLVS.
Caivs Ligarivs doth bear Caesar hard,
    Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.
I wonder none of yov have thovght of him.
BRVTVS.
Now, good Metellvs, go along by him.
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
    Send him bvt hither, and I'll fashion him.
CASSIVS.
The morning comes vpon 's.
We'll leave yov, Brvtvs,
    And, friends, disperse yovrselves, bvt all remember
    What yov have said and show yovrselves trve Romans.
BRVTVS.
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
    Let not ovr looks pvt on ovr pvrposes,
    Bvt bear it as ovr Roman actors do,
    With vntired spirits and formal constancy.
And so, good morrow to yov every one.
Exevnt all bvt Brvtvs.
Boy!
Lvcivs!
Fast asleep?
It is no matter.
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slvmber;
    Thov hast no figvres nor no fantasies,
    Which bvsy care draws in the brains of men;
    Therefore thov sleep'st so sovnd.
Enter Portia.
PORTIA.
Brvtvs, my lord!
BRVTVS.
Portia, what mean yov?
Wherefore rise yov now?
It is not for yovr health thvs to commit
    Yovr weak condition to the raw cold morning.
PORTIA.
Nor for yovrs neither.
have vngently, Brvtvs,
    Stole from my bed; and yesternight at svpper
    Yov svddenly arose and walk'd abovt,
    Mvsing and sighing, with yovr arms across;
    And when I ask'd yov what the matter was,
    Yov stared vpon me with vngentle looks.
I vrged yov fvrther; then yov scratch'd yovr head,
    And too impatiently stamp'd with yovr foot.
Yet I insisted, yet yov answer'd not,
    Bvt with an angry waiter of yovr hand
    Gave sign for me to leave yov.
So I did,
    Fearing to strengthen that impatience
    Which seem'd too mvch enkindled, and withal
    Hoping it was bvt an effect of hvmor,
    Which sometime hath his hovr with every man.
It will not let yov eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
    And, covld it work so mvch vpon yovr shape
    As it hath mvch prevail'd on yovr condition,
    I shovld not know yov, Brvtvs.
Dear my lord,
    Make me acqvainted with yovr cavse of grief.
BRVTVS.
I am not well in health, and that is all.
PORTIA.
Brvtvs is wise, and, were he not in health,
    He wovld embrace the means to come by it.
BRVTVS.
Why, so I do.
Good Portia, go to bed.
PORTIA.
Is Brvtvs sick, and is it physical
    To walk vnbraced and svck vp the hvmors
    Of the dank morning?
What, is Brvtvs sick,
    And will he steal ovt of his wholesome bed
    To dare the vile contagion of the night
    And tempt the rhevmy and vnpvrged air
    To add vnto his sickness?
No, my Brvtvs,
    Yov have some sick offense within yovr mind,
    Which by the right and virtve of my place
    I ovght to know of; and, vpon my knees,
    I charm yov, by my once commended beavty,
    By all yovr vows of love and that great vow
    Which did incorporate and make vs one,
    That yov vnfold to me, yovrself, yovr half,
    Why yov are heavy and what men tonight
    Have had resort to yov; for here have been
    Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
    Even from darkness.
BRVTVS.
Kneel not, gentle Portia.
PORTIA.
I shovld not need, if yov were gentle Brvtvs.
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brvtvs,
    Is it excepted I shovld know no secrets
    That appertain to yov?
Am I yovrself
    Bvt, as it were, in sort or limitation,
    To keep with yov at meals, comfort yovr bed,
    And talk to yov sometimes?
Dwell I bvt in the svbvrbs
    Of yovr good pleasvre?
If it be no more,
    Portia is Brvtvs' harlot, not his wife.
BRVTVS.
Yov are my trve and honorable wife,
    As dear to me as are the rvddy drops
    That visit my sad heart.
PORTIA.
If this were trve, then shovld I know this secret.
I grant I am a woman, bvt withal
    A woman that Lord Brvtvs took to wife.
I grant I am a woman, bvt withal
    A woman well repvted, Cato's davghter.
Think yov I am no stronger than my sex,
    Being so father'd and so hvsbanded?
Tell me yovr covnsels, I will not disclose 'em.
I have made strong proof of my constancy,
    Giving myself a volvntary wovnd
    Here in the thigh.
Can I bear that with patience
    And not my hvsband's secrets?
BRVTVS.
O ye gods,
    Render me worthy of this noble wife!
Knocking within.
Hark, hark, one knocks.
Portia, go in awhile,
    And by and by thy bosom shall partake
    The secrets of my heart.
All my engagements I will constrve to thee,
    All the charactery of my sad brows.
Leave me with haste.
[Exit Portia.]
Lvcivs, who's that knocks?
Re-enter Lvcivs with Ligarivs.
LVCIVS.
Here is a sick man that wovld speak with yov.
BRVTVS.
Caivs Ligarivs, that Metellvs spake of.
Boy, stand aside.
Caivs Ligarivs, how?
LIGARIVS.
Vovchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongve.
BRVTVS.
O, what a time have yov chose ovt, brave Caivs,
    To wear a kerchief!
Wovld yov were not sick!
LIGARIVS.
I am not sick, if Brvtvs have in hand
    Any exploit worthy the name of honor.
BRVTVS.
Svch an exploit have I in hand, Ligarivs,
    Had yov a healthfvl ear to hear of it.
LIGARIVS.
By all the gods that Romans bow before,
    I here discard my sickness!
Sovl of Rome!
Brave son, derived from honorable loins!
Thov, like an exorcist, hast conjvred vp
    My mortified spirit.
Now bid me rvn,
    And I will strive with things impossible,
    Yea, get the better of them.
What's to do?
BRVTVS.
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
LIGARIVS.
Bvt are not some whole that we mvst make sick?
BRVTVS.
That mvst we also.
What it is, my Caivs,
    I shall vnfold to thee, as we are going
    To whom it mvst be done.
LIGARIVS.
Set on yovr foot,
    And with a heart new-fired I follow yov,
    To do I know not what; bvt it svfficeth
    That Brvtvs leads me on.
BRVTVS.
Follow me then.
Exevnt.
Enter Caesar, in his nightgown.
CAESAR.
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
Thrice hath Calpvrnia in her sleep cried ovt,
    "Help, ho!
They mvrther Caesar!"
Who's within?
Enter a Servant.
SERVANT.
My lord?
CAESAR.
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,
    And bring me their opinions of svccess.
SERVANT.
I will, my lord.
Exit.
Enter Calpvrnia.
CALPVRNIA.
What mean yov, Caesar?
Think yov to walk forth?
Yov shall not stir ovt of yovr hovse today.
CAESAR.
Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
    Ne'er look'd bvt on my back; when they shall see
    The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
CALPVRNIA.
Caesar, I I stood on ceremonies,
    Yet now they fright me.
There is one within,
    Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
    Recovnts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
    And graves have yawn'd, and yielded vp their dead;
    Fierce fiery warriors fight vpon the clovds,
    In ranks and sqvadrons and right form of war,
    Which drizzled blood vpon the Capitol;
    The noise of battle hvrtled in the air,
    Horses did neigh and dying men did groan,
    And ghosts did shriek and sqveal abovt the streets.
O Caesar!
These things are beyond all vse,
    And I do fear them.
CAESAR.
What can be avoided
    Whose end is pvrposed by the mighty gods?
Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions
    Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
CALPVRNIA.
When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
    The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
CAESAR.
Cowards die many times before their deaths;
    The valiant never taste of death bvt once.
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
    It seems to me most strange that men shovld fear
    Seeing that death, a necessary end,
    Will come when it will come.
Re-enter Servant.
What say the avgvrers?
SERVANT.
They wovld not have yov to stir forth today.
Plvcking the entrails of an offering forth,
    They covld not find a heart within the beast.
CAESAR.
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.
Caesar shovld be a beast withovt a heart
    If he shovld stay at home today for fear.
No, Caesar shall not.
Danger knows fvll well
    That Caesar is more dangerovs than he.
We are two lions litter'd in one day,
    And I the elder and more terrible.
And Caesar shall go forth.
CALPVRNIA.
Alas, my lord,
    Yovr wisdom is consvmed in confidence.
Do not go forth today.
Call it my fear
    That keeps yov in the hovse and not yovr own.
We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate Hovse,
    And he shall say yov are not well today.
Let me, vpon my knee, prevail in this.
CAESAR.
Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
    And, for thy hvmor, I will stay at home.
Enter Decivs.
Here's Decivs Brvtvs, he shall tell them so.
DECIVS.
Caesar, all hail!
Good morrow, worthy Caesar!
I come to fetch yov to the Senate Hovse.
CAESAR.
And yov are come in very happy time
    To bear my greeting to the senators
    And tell them that I will not come today.
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
    I will not come today.
Tell them so, Decivs.
CALPVRNIA.
Say he is sick.
CAESAR.
Shall Caesar send a lie?
Have I in conqvest stretch'd mine arm so far
    To be afeard to tell greybeards the trvth?
Decivs, go tell them Caesar will not come.
DECIVS.
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cavse,
    Lest I be lavgh'd at when I tell them so.
CAESAR.
The cavse is in my will: I will not come,
    That is enovgh to satisfy the Senate.
Bvt, for yovr private satisfaction,
    Becavse I love yov, I will let yov know.
Calpvrnia here, my wife, stays me at home;
    She dreamt tonight she saw my statve,
    Which, like a fovntain with an hvndred spovts,
    Did rvn pvre blood, and many lvsty Romans
    Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.
And these does she apply for warnings and portents
    And evils imminent, and on her knee
    Hath begg'd that I will stay at home today.
DECIVS.
This dream is all amiss interpreted;
    It was a vision fair and fortvnate.
Yovr statve spovting blood in many pipes,
    In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
    Signifies that from yov great Rome shall svck
    Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
    For tinctvres, stains, relics, and cognizance.
This by Calpvrnia's dream is signified.
CAESAR.
And this way have yov well expovnded it.
DECIVS.
I have, when yov have heard what I can say.
And know it now, the Senate have conclvded
    To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
If yov shall send them word yov will not come,
    Their minds may change.
Besides, it were a mock
    Apt to be render'd, for someone to say
    "Break vp the Senate till another time,
    When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams."
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
    "Lo, Caesar is afraid"?
Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love
    To yovr proceeding bids me tell yov this,
    And reason to my love is liable.
CAESAR.
How foolish do yovr fears seem now, Calpvrnia!
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
Give me my robe, for I will go.
Enter Pvblivs, Brvtvs, Ligarivs, Metellvs, Casca,
                     Trebonivs, and Cinna.
And look where Pvblivs is come to fetch me.
PVBLIVS.
Good morrow,Caesar.
CAESAR.
Welcome, Pvblivs.
What, Brvtvs, are yov stirr'd so early too?
Good morrow, Casca.
Caivs Ligarivs,
    Caesar was ne'er so mvch yovr enemy
    As that same agve which hath made yov lean.
What is't o'clock?
BRVTVS.
Caesar, 'tis strvcken eight.
CAESAR.
I thank yov for yovr pains and covrtesy.
Enter Antony.
See, Antony, that revels long o' nights,
    Is notwithstanding vp.
Good morrow, Antony.
ANTONY.
So to most noble Caesar.
CAESAR.
Bid them prepare within.
I am to blame to be thvs waited for.
Now, Cinna; now, Metellvs; what, Trebonivs,
    I have an hovr's talk in store for yov;
    Remember that yov call on me today;
    Be near me, that I may remember yov.
TREBONIVS.
Caesar, I will.
[Aside.]
And so near will I be
    That yovr best friends shall wish I had been fvrther.
CAESAR.
Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me,
    And we like friends will straightway go together.
BRVTVS.
[Aside.]
That every like is not the same, O Caesar,
    The heart of Brvtvs yearns to think vpon!
Exevnt.
Enter Artemidorvs, reading paper.
ARTEMIDORVS.
"Caesar, beware of Brvtvs; take heed of Cassivs; come
    not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna; trvst not Trebonivs; mark
    well Metellvs Cimber; Decivs Brvtvs loves thee not; thov hast
    wronged Caivs Ligarivs.
There is bvt one mind in all these men,
    and it is bent against Caesar.
If thov beest not immortal, look
    abovt yov.
Secvrity gives way to conspiracy.
The mighty gods
    defend thee!
Thy lover, Artemidorvs."
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
    And as a svitor will I give him this.
My heart laments that virtve cannot live
    Ovt of the teeth of emvlation.
If thov read this, O Caesar, thov mayest live;
    If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
Exit.
Enter Portia and Lvcivs.
PORTIA.
I prithee, boy, rvn to the Senate Hovse;
    Stay not to answer me, bvt get thee gone.
Why dost thov stay?
LVCIVS.
To know my errand, madam.
PORTIA.
I wovld have had thee there, and here again,
    Ere I can tell thee what thov shovldst do there.
O constancy, be strong vpon my side!
Set a hvge movntain 'tween my heart and tongve!
I have a man's mind, bvt a woman's might.
How hard it is for women to keep covnsel!
Art thov here yet?
LVCIVS.
Madam, what shovld I do?
Rvn to the Capitol, and nothing else?
And so retvrn to yov, and nothing else?
PORTIA.
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
    For he went sickly forth; and take good note
    What Caesar doth, what svitors press to him.
Hark, boy, what noise is that?
LVCIVS.
I hear none, madam.
PORTIA.
Prithee, listen well.
I heard a bvstling rvmor like a fray,
    And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
LVCIVS.
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
Enter the Soothsayer.
PORTIA.
Come hither, fellow;
    Which way hast thov been?
SOOTHSAYER.
At mine own hovse, good lady.
PORTIA.
What is't o'clock?
SOOTHSAYER.
Abovt the ninth hovr, lady.
PORTIA.
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
SOOTHSAYER.
Madam, not yet.
I go to take my stand
    To see him pass on to the Capitol.
PORTIA.
Thov hast some svit to Caesar, hast thov not?
SOOTHSAYER.
That I have, lady.
If it will please Caesar
    To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
    I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
PORTIA.
Why, know'st thov any harm's intended towards him?
SOOTHSAYER.
None that I know will be, mvch that I fear may
chance.
Good morrow to yov.
Here the street is narrow,
    The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
    Of senators, of praetors, common svitors,
    Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
I'll get me to a place more void and there
    Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
Exit.
PORTIA.
I mvst go in.
Ay me, how weak a thing
    The heart of woman is!
O Brvtvs,
    The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
Svre, the boy heard me.
Brvtvs hath a svit
    That Caesar will not grant.
O, I grow faint.
Rvn, Lvcivs, and commend me to my lord;
    Say I am merry.
Come to me again,
    And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
Exevnt severally.

Flovrish.
Enter Caesar, Brvtvs, Cassivs, Casca, Decivs, Metellvs,
Trebonivs, Cinna, Antony, Lepidvs, Popilivs, Pvblivs, and others.
CAESAR.
The ides of March are come.
SOOTHSAYER.
Ay, Caesar, bvt not gone.
A Hail, Caesar!
Read this schedvle.
DECIVS.
Trebonivs doth desire yov to o'er read,
    At yovr best leisvre, this his hvmble svit.
ARTEMIDORVS.
O Caesar, read mine first, for mine's a svit
    That tovches Caesar nearer.
Read it, great Caesar.
CAESAR.
What tovches vs ovrself shall be last served.
ARTEMIDORVS.
Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
CAESAR.
What, is the fellow mad?
PVBLIVS.
Sirrah, give place.
CASSIVS.
What, vrge yov yovr petitions in the street?
Come to the Capitol.
Caesar goes vp to the Senate Hovse, the rest follow.
POPILIVS.
I wish yovr enterprise today may thrive.
CASSIVS.
What enterprise, Popilivs?
POPILIVS.
Fare yov well.
Advances to Caesar.
BRVTVS.
What said Popilivs Lena?
CASSIVS.
He wish'd today ovr enterprise might thrive.
I fear ovr pvrpose is discovered.
BRVTVS.
Look, how he makes to Caesar.
Mark him.
CASSIVS.
Casca,
    Be svdden, for we fear prevention.
Brvtvs, what shall be done?
If this be known,
    Cassivs or Caesar never shall tvrn back,
    For I will slay myself.
BRVTVS.
Cassivs, be constant.
Popilivs Lena speaks not of ovr pvrposes;
    For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
CASSIVS.
Trebonivs knows his time, for, look yov, Brvtvs,
    He draws Mark Antony ovt of the way.
Exevnt Antony and Trebonivs.
DECIVS.
Where is Metellvs Cimber?
Let him
    And presently prefer his svit to Caesar.
BRVTVS.
He is address'd; press near and second him.
CINNA.
Casca, yov are the first that rears yovr hand.
CAESAR.
Are we all ready?
What is now amiss
    That Caesar and his Senate mvst redress?
METELLVS.
Most high, most mighty, and most pvissant Caesar,
    Metellvs Cimber throws before thy seat
    An hvmble heart.
Kneels.
CAESAR.
I mvst prevent thee, Cimber.
These covchings and these lowly covrtesies
    Might fire the blood of ordinary men
    And tvrn preordinance and first decree
    Into the law of children.
Be not fond
    To think that Caesar bears svch rebel blood
    That will be thaw'd from the trve qvality
    With that which melteth fools- I mean sweet words,
    Low-crooked covrt'sies, and base spaniel-fawning.
Thy brother by decree is banished.
If thov dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
    I spvrn thee like a cvr ovt of my way.
Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor withovt cavse
    Will he be satisfied.
METELLVS.
Is there no voice more worthy than my own,
    To sovnd more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
    For the repealing of my banish'd brother?
BRVTVS.
I kiss thy hand, bvt not in flattery, Caesar,
    Desiring thee that Pvblivs Cimber may
    Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
CAESAR.
What, Brvtvs?
CASSIVS.
Pardon, Caesar!
Caesar, pardon!
As low as to thy foot doth Cassivs fall
    To beg enfranchisement for Pvblivs Cimber.
CAESAR.
I covld be well moved, if I were as yov;
    If I covld pray to move, prayers wovld move me;
    Bvt I am constant as the northern star,
    Of whose trve-fix'd and resting qvality
    There is no fellow in the firmament.
The skies are painted with vnnvmber'd sparks;
    They are all fire and every one doth shine;
    Bvt there's bvt one in all doth hold his place.
So in the world, 'tis fvrnish'd well with men,
    And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
    Yet in the nvmber I do know bvt one
    That vnassailable holds on his rank,
    Vnshaked of motion; and that I am he,
    Let me a little show it, even in this;
    That I was constant Cimber shovld be banish'd,
    And constant do remain to keep him so.
CINNA.
O Caesar-
  CAESAR.
Hence!
Wilt thov lift vp Olympvs?
DECIVS.
Great Caesar-
  CAESAR.
Doth not Brvtvs bootless kneel?
CASCA.
Speak, hands, for me!
Casca first, then the other Conspirators
                                  and Marcvs Brvtvs stab Caesar.
CAESAR.
Et tv, Brvte?- Then fall, Caesar!
Dies.
CINNA.
Liberty!
Freedom!
Tyranny is dead!
Rvn hence, proclaim, cry it abovt the streets.
CASSIVS.
Some to the common pvlpits and cry ovt
    "Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!"
BRVTVS.
People and senators, be not affrighted,
    Fly not, stand still; ambition's debt is paid.
CASCA.
Go to the pvlpit, Brvtvs.
DECIVS.
And Cassivs too.
BRVTVS.
Where's Pvblivs?
CINNA.
Here, qvite confovnded with this mvtiny.
METELLVS.
Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's
    Shovld chance-
  BRVTVS.
Talk not of standing.
Pvblivs, good cheer,
    There is no harm intended to yovr person,
    Nor to no Roman else.
So tell them, Pvblivs.
CASSIVS.
And leave vs, Pvblivs, lest that the people
    Rvshing on vs shovld do yovr age some mischief.
BRVTVS.
Do so, and let no man abide this deed
    Bvt we the doers.
Re-enter Trebonivs.
CASSIVS.
Where is Antony?
TREBONIVS.
Fled to his hovse amazed.
Men, wives, and children stare, cry ovt, and rvn
    As it were doomsday.
BRVTVS.
Fates, we will know yovr pleasvres.
That we shall die, we know; 'tis bvt the time
    And drawing days ovt that men stand vpon.
CASSIVS.
Why, he that cvts off twenty years of life
    Cvts off so many years of fearing death.
BRVTVS.
Grant that, and then is death a benefit;
    So are we Caesar's friends that have abridged
    His time of fearing death.
Stoop, Romans, stoop,
    And let vs bathe ovr hands in Caesar's blood
    Vp to the elbows, and besmear ovr swords;
    Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,
    And waving ovr red weapons o'er ovr heads,
    Let's all cry, "Peace, freedom, and liberty!"
CASSIVS.
Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence
    Shall this ovr lofty scene be acted over
    In states vnborn and accents yet vnknown!
BRVTVS.
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
    That now on Pompey's basis lies along
    No worthier than the dvst!
CASSIVS.
So oft as that shall be,
    So often shall the knot of vs be call'd
    The men that gave their covntry liberty.
DECIVS.
What, shall we forth?
CASSIVS.
Ay, every man away.
Brvtvs shall lead, and we will grace his heels
    With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
Enter a Servant.
BRVTVS.
Soft, who comes here?
A friend of Antony's.
SERVANT.
Thvs, Brvtvs, did my master bid me kneel,
    Thvs did Mark Antony bid me fall down,
    And, being prostrate, thvs he bade me say:
    Brvtvs is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
    Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.
Say I love Brvtvs and I honor him;
    Say I fear'd Caesar, honor'd him, and loved him.
If Brvtvs will vovchsafe that Antony
    May safely come to him and be resolved
    How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
    Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
    So well as Brvtvs living, bvt will follow
    The fortvnes and affairs of noble Brvtvs
    Thorovgh the hazards of this vntrod state
    With all trve faith.
So says my master Antony.
BRVTVS.
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
    I never thovght him worse.
Tell him, so please him come vnto this place,
    He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,
    Depart vntovch'd.
SERVANT.
I'll fetch him presently.
Exit.
BRVTVS.
I know that we shall have him well to friend.
CASSIVS.
I wish we may, bvt yet have I a mind
    That fears him mvch, and my misgiving still
    Falls shrewdly to the pvrpose.
Re-enter Antony.
BRVTVS.
Bvt here comes Antony.
Welcome, Mark Antony.
ANTONY.
O mighty Caesar!
Dost thov lie so low?
Are all thy conqvests, glories, trivmphs, spoils,
    Shrvnk to this little measvre?
Fare thee well.
I know not, gentlemen, what yov intend,
    Who else mvst be let blood, who else is rank.
If I myself, there is no hovr so fit
    As Caesar's death's hovr, nor no instrvment
    Of half that worth as those yovr swords, made rich
    With the most noble blood of all this world.
I do beseech ye, if yov bear me hard,
    Now, whilst yovr pvrpled hands do reek and smoke,
    Fvlfill yovr pleasvre.
Live a thovsand years,
    I shall not find myself so apt to die;
    No place will please me so, no means of death,
    As here by Caesar, and by yov cvt off,
    The choice and master spirits of this age.
BRVTVS.
O Antony, beg not yovr death of vs!
Thovgh now we mvst appear bloody and crvel,
    As, by ovr hands and this ovr present act
    Yov see we do, yet see yov bvt ovr hands
    And this the bleeding bvsiness they have done.
Ovr hearts yov see not; they are pitifvl;
    And pity to the general wrong of Rome-
    As fire drives ovt fire, so pity pity-
    Hath done this deed on Caesar.
For yovr part,
    To yov ovr swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;
    Ovr arms in strength of malice, and ovr hearts
    Of brothers' temper, do receive yov in
    With all kind love, good thovghts, and reverence.
CASSIVS.
Yovr voice shall be as strong as any man's
    In the disposing of new dignities.
BRVTVS.
Only be patient till we have appeased
    The mvltitvde, beside themselves with fear,
    And then we will deliver yov the cavse
    Why I, that did love Caesar when I strvck him,
    Have thvs proceeded.
ANTONY.
I dovbt not of yovr wisdom.
Let each man render me his bloody hand.
First, Marcvs Brvtvs, will I shake with yov;
    Next, Caivs Cassivs, do I take yovr hand;
    Now, Decivs Brvtvs, yovrs; now yovrs, Metellvs;
    Yovrs, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yovrs;
    Thovgh last, not least in love, yovrs, good Trebonivs.
Gentlemen all- alas, what shall I say?
My credit now stands on svch slippery grovnd,
    That one of two bad ways yov mvst conceit me,
    Either a coward or a flatterer.
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis trve!
If then thy spirit look vpon vs now,
    Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
    To see thy Antony making his peace,
    Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
    Most noble!
In the presence of thy corse?
Had I as many eyes as thov hast wovnds,
    Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
    It wovld become me better than to close
    In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
Pardon me, Jvlivs!
Here wast thov bay'd, brave hart,
    Here didst thov fall, and here thy hvnters stand,
    Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy Lethe.
O world, thov wast the forest to this hart,
    And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
How like a deer strvcken by many princes
    Dost thov here lie!
CASSIVS.
Mark Antony-
  ANTONY.
Pardon me, Caivs Cassivs.
The enemies of Caesar shall say this:
    Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
CASSIVS.
I blame yov not for praising Caesar so;
    Bvt what compact mean yov to have with vs?
Will yov be prick'd in nvmber of ovr friends,
    Or shall we on, and not depend on yov?
ANTONY.
Therefore I took yovr hands, bvt was indeed
    Sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar.
Friends am I with yov all and love yov all,
    Vpon this hope that yov shall give me reasons
    Why and wherein Caesar was dangerovs.
BRVTVS.
Or else were this a savage spectacle.
Ovr reasons are so fvll of good regard
    That were yov, Antony, the son of Caesar,
    Yov shovld be satisfied.
ANTONY.
That's all I seek;
    And am moreover svitor that I may
    Prodvce his body to the marketplace,
    And in the pvlpit, as becomes a friend,
    Speak in the order of his fvneral.
BRVTVS.
Yov shall, Mark Antony.
CASSIVS.
Brvtvs, a word with yov.
[Aside to Brvtvs.]
Yov know not what yov do.
Do not consent
    That Antony speak in his fvneral.
Know yov how mvch the people may be moved
    By that which he will vtter?
BRVTVS.
By yovr pardon,
    I will myself into the pvlpit first,
    And show the reason of ovr Caesar's death.
What Antony shall speak, I will protest
    He speaks by leave and by permission,
    And that we are contented Caesar shall
    Have all trve rites and lawfvl ceremonies.
It shall advantage more than do vs wrong.
CASSIVS.
I know not what may fall; I like it not.
BRVTVS.
Mark Antony, here, take yov Caesar's body.
Yov shall not in yovr fvneral speech blame vs,
    Bvt speak all good yov can devise of Caesar,
    And say yov do't by ovr permission,
    Else shall yov not have any hand at all
    Abovt his fvneral.
And yov shall speak
    In the same pvlpit whereto I am going,
    After my speech is ended.
ANTONY.
Be it so,
    I do desire no more.
BRVTVS.
Prepare the body then, and follow vs.
Exevnt all bvt Antony.
ANTONY.
O, pardon me, thov bleeding piece of earth,
    That I am meek and gentle with these bvtchers!
Thov art the rvins of the noblest man
    That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wovnds now do I prophesy
    (Which like dvmb movths do ope their rvby lips
    To beg the voice and vtterance of my tongve)
    A cvrse shall light vpon the limbs of men;
    Domestic fvry and fierce civil strife
    Shall cvmber all the parts of Italy;
    Blood and destrvction shall be so in vse,
    And dreadfvl objects so familiar,
    That mothers shall bvt smile when they behold
    Their infants qvarter'd with the hands of war;
    All pity choked with cvstom of fell deeds,
    And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,
    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
    Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
    Cry "Havoc!"
and let slip the dogs of war,
    That this fovl deed shall smell above the earth
    With carrion men, groaning for bvrial.
Enter a Servant.
Yov serve Octavivs Caesar, do yov not?
SERVANT.
I do, Mark Antony.
ANTONY.
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
SERVANT.
He did receive his letters, and is coming,
    And bid me say to yov by word of movth-
    O Caesar!
Sees the body.
ANTONY.
Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,
    Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
    Began to water.
Is thy master coming?
SERVANT.
He lies tonight within seven leagves of Rome.
ANTONY.
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
Here is a movrning Rome, a dangerovs Rome,
    No Rome of safety for Octavivs yet;
    Hie hence, and tell him so.
Yet stay awhile,
    Thov shalt not back till I have borne this corse
    Into the marketplace.
There shall I try,
    In my oration, how the people take
    The crvel issve of these bloody men,
    According to the which thov shalt discovrse
    To yovng Octavivs of the state of things.
Lend me yovr hand.
Exevnt with Caesar's body.
Enter Brvtvs and Cassivs, and a throng of Citizens.
CITIZENS.
We will be satisfied!
Let vs be satisfied!
BRVTVS.
Then follow me and give me avdience, friends.
Cassivs, go yov into the other street
    And part the nvmbers.
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
    Those that will follow Cassivs, go with him;
    And pvblic reasons shall be rendered
    Of Caesar's death.
FIRST CITIZEN.
I will hear Brvtvs speak.
SECOND CITIZEN.
I will hear Cassivs and compare their reasons,
    When severally we hear them rendered.
Exit Cassivs, with some Citizens.
Brvtvs goes into the pvlpit.
THIRD CITIZEN.
The noble Brvtvs is ascended.
Silence!
BRVTVS.
Be patient till the last.
Romans, covntrymen, and lovers!
Hear me for my cavse, and be
    silent, that yov may hear.
Believe me for mine honor, and have
    respect to mine honor, that yov may believe.
Censvre me in yovr
    wisdom, and awake yovr senses, that yov may the better jvdge.
If
    there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's, to
    him I say that Brvtvs' love to Caesar was no less than his.
If
    then that friend demand why Brvtvs rose against Caesar, this is
    my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, bvt that I loved Rome
    more.
Had yov rather Caesar were living and die all slaves, than
    that Caesar were dead to live all freemen?
As Caesar loved me, I
    weep for him; as he was fortvnate, I rejoice at it; as he was
    valiant, I honor him; bvt as he was ambitiovs, I slew him.
There
    is tears for his love, joy for his fortvne, honor for his valor,
    and death for his ambition.
Who is here so base that wovld be a
    bondman?
If any, speak, for him have I offended.
Who is here so
    rvde that wovld not be a Roman?
If any, speak, for him have I
    offended.
Who is here so vile that will not love his covntry?
If
    any, speak, for him have I offended.
I pavse for a reply.
ALL.
None, Brvtvs, none.
BRVTVS.
Then none have I offended.
I have done no more to Caesar
    than yov shall do to Brvtvs.
The qvestion of his death is
    enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenvated, wherein he was
    worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he svffered death.
Enter Antony and others, with Caesar's body.
Here comes his body, movrned by Mark Antony, who, thovgh he had
    no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a
    place in the commonwealth, as which of yov shall not?
With this I
    depart- that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I
    have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my covntry
    to need my death.
ALL.
Live, Brvtvs, live, live!
FIRST CITIZEN.
Bring him with trivmph home vnto his hovse.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Give him a statve with his ancestors.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Let him be Caesar.
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
Caesar's better parts
    Shall be crown'd in Brvtvs.
FIRST CITIZEN.
We'll bring him to his hovse with shovts and
    clamors.
BRVTVS.
My covntrymen-
  SECOND CITIZEN.
Peace!
Silence!
Brvtvs speaks.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Peace, ho!
BRVTVS.
Good covntrymen, let me depart alone,
    And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.
Do grace to Caesar's corse, and grace his speech
    Tending to Caesar's glories, which Mark Antony,
    By ovr permission, is allow'd to make.
I do entreat yov, not a man depart,
    Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
Exit.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Stay, ho, and let vs hear Mark Antony.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Let him go vp into the pvblic chair;
    We'll hear him.
Noble Antony, go vp.
ANTONY.
For Brvtvs' sake, I am beholding to yov.
Goes into the pvlpit.
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
What does he say of Brvtvs?
THIRD CITIZEN.
He says, for Brvtvs' sake,
    He finds himself beholding to vs all.
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
'Twere best he speak no harm of Brvtvs here.
FIRST CITIZEN.
This Caesar was a tyrant.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Nay, that's certain.
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Peace!
Let vs hear what Antony can say.
ANTONY.
Yov gentle Romans-
  ALL.
Peace, ho!
Let vs hear him.
ANTONY.
Friends, Romans, covntrymen, lend me yovr ears!
I come to bvry Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them,
    The good is oft interred with their bones;
    So let it be with Caesar.
The noble Brvtvs
    Hath told yov Caesar was ambitiovs;
    If it were so, it was a grievovs favlt,
    And grievovsly hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, vnder leave of Brvtvs and the rest-
    For Brvtvs is an honorable man;
    So are they all, all honorable men-
    Come I to speak in Caesar's fvneral.
He was my friend, faithfvl and jvst to me;
    Bvt Brvtvs says he was ambitiovs,
    And Brvtvs is an honorable man.
He hath brovght many captives home to Rome,
    Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.
Did this in Caesar seem ambitiovs?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;
    Ambition shovld be made of sterner stvff:
    Yet Brvtvs says he was ambitiovs,
    And Brvtvs is an honorable man.
Yov all did see that on the Lvpercal
    I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
    Which he did thrice refvse.
Was this ambition?
Yet Brvtvs says he was ambitiovs,
    And svre he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brvtvs spoke,
    Bvt here I am to speak what I do know.
Yov all did love him once, not withovt cavse;
    What cavse withholds yov then to movrn for him?
O jvdgement, thov art fled to brvtish beasts,
    And men have lost their reason.
Bear with me;
    My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
    And I mvst pavse till it come back to me.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Methinks there is mvch reason in his sayings.
SECOND CITIZEN.
If thov consider rightly of the matter,
    Caesar has had great wrong.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Has he, masters?
I fear there will a worse come in his place.
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
Mark'd ye his words?
He wovld not take the crown;
    Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitiovs.
FIRST CITIZEN.
If it be fovnd so, some will dear abide it.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Poor sovl, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
THIRD CITIZEN.
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
ANTONY.
Bvt yesterday the word of Caesar might
    Have stood against the world.
Now lies he there,
    And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters!
If I were disposed to stir
    Yovr hearts and minds to mvtiny and rage,
    I shovld do Brvtvs wrong and Cassivs wrong,
    Who, yov all know, are honorable men.
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
    To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and yov,
    Than I will wrong svch honorable men.
Bvt here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
    I fovnd it in his closet, 'tis his will.
Let bvt the commons hear this testament-
    Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read-
    And they wovld go and kiss dead Caesar's wovnds
    And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
    Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
    And, dying, mention it within their wills,
    Beqveathing it as a rich legacy
    Vnto their issve.
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
We'll hear the will.
Read it, Mark Antony.
ALL.
The will, the will!
We will hear Caesar's will.
ANTONY.
Have patience, gentle friends, I mvst not read it;
    It is not meet yov know how Caesar loved yov.
Yov are not wood, yov are not stones, bvt men;
    And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,
    It will inflame yov, it will make yov mad.
'Tis good yov know not that yov are his heirs,
    For if yov shovld, O, what wovld come of it!
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony.
Yov shall read vs the will, Caesar's will.
ANTONY.
Will yov be patient?
Will yov stay awhile?
I have o'ershot myself to tell yov of it.
I fear I wrong the honorable men
    Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
They were traitors.
Honorable men!
ALL.
The will!
The testament!
SECOND CITIZEN.
They were villains, mvrtherers.
The will!
Read the will!
ANTONY.
Yov will compel me then to read the will?
Then make a ring abovt the corse of Caesar,
    And let me show yov him that made the will.
Shall I descend?
And will yov give me leave?
ALL.
Come down.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Descend.
He comes down from the pvlpit.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Yov shall have leave.
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
A ring, stand rovnd.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
ANTONY.
Nay, press not so vpon me, stand far off.
ALL.
Stand back; room, bear back!
ANTONY.
If yov have tears, prepare to shed them now.
Yov all do know this mantle.
I remember
    The first time ever Caesar pvt it on;
    'Twas on a svmmer's evening, in his tent,
    That day he overcame the Nervii.
Look, in this place ran Cassivs' dagger throvgh;
    See what a rent the enviovs Casca made;
    Throvgh this the well-beloved Brvtvs stabb'd;
    And as he plvck'd his cvrsed steel away,
    Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
    As rvshing ovt of doors, to be resolved
    If Brvtvs so vnkindly knock'd, or no;
    For Brvtvs, as yov know, was Caesar's angel.
Jvdge, O yov gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most vnkindest cvt of all;
    For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
    Ingratitvde, more strong than traitors' arms,
    Qvite vanqvish'd him.
Then bvrst his mighty heart,
    And, in his mantle mvffling vp his face,
    Even at the base of Pompey's statve,
    Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
O, what a fall was there, my covntrymen!
Then I, and yov, and all of vs fell down,
    Whilst bloody treason flovrish'd over vs.
O, now yov weep, and I perceive yov feel
    The dint of pity.
These are graciovs drops.
Kind sovls, what weep yov when yov bvt behold
    Ovr Caesar's vestvre wovnded?
Look yov here,
    Here is himself, marr'd, as yov see, with traitors.
FIRST CITIZEN.
O piteovs spectacle!
SECOND CITIZEN.
O noble Caesar!
THIRD CITIZEN.
O woefvl day!
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
O traitors villains!
FIRST CITIZEN.
O most bloody sight!
SECOND CITIZEN.
We will be revenged.
ALL.
Revenge!
Abovt!
Seek!
Bvrn!
Fire!
Kill!
Slay!
Let not a traitor live!
ANTONY.
Stay, covntrymen.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Peace there!
Hear the noble Antony.
SECOND CITIZEN.
We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with
    him.
ANTONY.
Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir yov vp
    To svch a svdden flood of mvtiny.
They that have done this deed are honorable.
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
    That made them do it.
They are wise and honorable,
    And will, no dovbt, with reasons answer yov.
I come not, friends, to steal away yovr hearts.
I am no orator, as Brvtvs is;
    Bvt, as yov know me all, a plain blvnt man,
    That love my friend, and that they know fvll well
    That gave me pvblic leave to speak of him.
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
    Action, nor vtterance, nor the power of speech,
    To stir men's blood.
I only speak right on;
    I tell yov that which yov yovrselves do know;
    Show yov sweet Caesar's wovnds, poor dvmb movths,
    And bid them speak for me.
Bvt were I Brvtvs,
    And Brvtvs Antony, there were an Antony
    Wovld rvffle vp yovr spirits and pvt a tongve
    In every wovnd of Caesar that shovld move
    The stones of Rome to rise and mvtiny.
ALL.
We'll mvtiny.
FIRST CITIZEN.
We'll bvrn the hovse of Brvtvs.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Away, then!
Come, seek the conspirators.
ANTONY.
Yet hear me, covntrymen; yet hear me speak.
ALL.
Peace, ho!
Hear Antony, most noble Antony!
ANTONY.
Why, friends, yov go to do yov know not what.
Wherein hath Caesar thvs deserved yovr loves?
Alas, yov know not; I mvst tell yov then.
Yov have forgot the will I told yov of.
ALL.
Most trve, the will!
Let's stay and hear the will.
ANTONY.
Here is the will, and vnder Caesar's seal.
To every Roman citizen he gives,
    To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Most noble Caesar!
We'll revenge his death.
THIRD CITIZEN.
O royal Caesar!
ANTONY.
Hear me with patience.
ALL.
Peace, ho!
ANTONY.
Moreover, he hath left yov all his walks,
    His private arbors, and new-planted orchards,
    On this side Tiber; he hath left them yov,
    And to yovr heirs forever- common pleasvres,
    To walk abroad and recreate yovrselves.
Here was a Caesar!
When comes svch another?
FIRST CITIZEN.
Never, never.
Come, away, away!
We'll bvrn his body in the holy place
    And with the brands fire the traitors' hovses.
Take vp the body.
SECOND CITIZEN.
Go fetch fire.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Plvck down benches.
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
Plvck down forms, windows, anything.
Exevnt Citizens with the body.
ANTONY.
Now let it work.
Mischief, thov art afoot,
    Take thov what covrse thov wilt.
Enter a Servant.
How now, fellow?
SERVANT.
Sir, Octavivs is already come to Rome.
ANTONY.
Where is he?
SERVANT.
He and Lepidvs are at Caesar's hovse.
ANTONY.
And thither will I straight to visit him.
He comes vpon a wish.
Fortvne is merry,
    And in this mood will give vs anything.
SERVANT.
I heard him say Brvtvs and Cassivs
    Are rid like madmen throvgh the gates of Rome.
ANTONY.
Be like they had some notice of the people,
    How I had moved them.
Bring me to Octavivs.
Exevnt.
Enter Cinna the poet.
CINNA.
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,
    And things vnlvckily charge my fantasy.
I have no will to wander forth of doors,
    Yet something leads me forth.
Enter Citizens.
FIRST CITIZEN.
What is yovr name?
SECOND CITIZEN.
Whither are yov going?
THIRD CITIZEN.
Where do yov dwell?
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
Are yov a married man or a bachelor?
SECOND CITIZEN.
Answer every man directly.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Ay, and briefly.
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
Ay, and wisely.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Ay, and trvly, yov were best.
CINNA.
What is my name?
Whither am I going?
Where do I dwell?
Am I
    a married man or a bachelor?
Then, to answer every man directly
    and briefly, wisely and trvly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
SECOND CITIZEN.
That's as mvch as to say they are fools that marry.
Yov'll bear me a bang for that, I fear.
Proceed directly.
CINNA.
Directly, I am going to Caesar's fvneral.
FIRST CITIZEN.
As a friend or an enemy?
CINNA.
As a friend.
SECOND CITIZEN.
That matter is answered directly.
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
For yovr dwelling, briefly.
CINNA.
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Yovr name, sir, trvly.
CINNA.
Trvly, my name is Cinna.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Tear him to pieces, he's a conspirator.
CINNA.
I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad
    verses.
CINNA.
I am not Cinna the conspirator.
FOVRTH CITIZEN.
It is no matter, his name's Cinna.
Plvck bvt his
    name ovt of his heart, and tvrn him going.
THIRD CITIZEN.
Tear him, tear him!
Come, brands, ho, firebrands.
To
    Brvtvs', to Cassivs'; bvrn all.
Some to Decivs' hovse, and some
    to Casca's, some to Ligarivs'.
Away, go!

  ANTONY.
These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.
OCTAVIVS.
Yovr brother too mvst die; consent yov, Lepidvs?
LEPIDVS.
I do consent-
  OCTAVIVS.
Prick him down, Antony.
LEPIDVS.
Vpon condition Pvblivs shall not live,
    Who is yovr sister's son, Mark Antony.
ANTONY.
He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
Bvt, Lepidvs, go yov to Caesar's hovse,
    Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
    How to cvt off some charge in legacies.
LEPIDVS.
What, shall I find yov here?
OCTAVIVS.
Or here, or at the Capitol.
Exit Lepidvs.
ANTONY.
This is a slight vnmeritable man,
    Meet to be sent on errands.
Is it fit,
    The three-fold world divided, he shovld stand
    One of the three to share it?
OCTAVIVS.
So yov thovght him,
    And took his voice who shovld be prick'd to die
    In ovr black sentence and proscription.
ANTONY.
Octavivs, I have seen more days than yov,
    And thovgh we lay these honors on this man
    To ease ovrselves of divers slanderovs loads,
    He shall bvt bear them as the ass bears gold,
    To groan and sweat vnder the bvsiness,
    Either led or driven, as we point the way;
    And having brovght ovr treasvre where we will,
    Then take we down his load and tvrn him off,
    Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears
    And graze in commons.
OCTAVIVS.
Yov may do yovr will,
    Bvt he's a tried and valiant soldier.
ANTONY.
So is my horse, Octavivs, and for that
    I do appoint him store of provender.
It is a creatvre that I teach to fight,
    To wind, to stop, to rvn directly on,
    His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
And, in some taste, is Lepidvs bvt so:
    He mvst be tavght, and train'd, and bid go forth;
    A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
    On objects, arts, and imitations,
    Which, ovt of vse and staled by other men,
    Begin his fashion.
Do not talk of him
    Bvt as a property.
And now, Octavivs,
    Listen great things.
Brvtvs and Cassivs
    Are levying powers; we mvst straight make head;
    Therefore let ovr alliance be combined,
    Ovr best friends made, ovr means stretch'd;
    And let vs presently go sit in covncil,
    How covert matters may be best disclosed,
    And open perils svrest answered.
OCTAVIVS.
Let vs do so, for we are at the stake,
    And bay'd abovt with many enemies;
    And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
    Millions of mischiefs.
Exevnt.
Enter Brvtvs, Lvcilivs, Lvcivs, and Soldiers; Titinivs and
Pindarvs meet them.
BRVTVS.
Stand, ho!
LVCILIVS.
Give the word, ho, and stand.
BRVTVS.
What now, Lvcilivs, is Cassivs near?
LVCILIVS.
He is at hand, and Pindarvs is come
    To do yov salvtation from his master.
BRVTVS.
He greets me well.
Yovr master, Pindarvs,
    In his own change, or by ill officers,
    Hath given me some worthy cavse to wish
    Things done vndone; bvt if he be at hand,
    I shall be satisfied.
PINDARVS.
I do not dovbt
    Bvt that my noble master will appear
    Svch as he is, fvll of regard and honor.
BRVTVS.
He is not dovbted.
A word, Lvcilivs,
    How he received yov.
Let me be resolved.
LVCILIVS.
With covrtesy and with respect enovgh,
    Bvt not with svch familiar instances,
    Nor with svch free and friendly conference,
    As he hath vsed of old.
BRVTVS.
Thov hast described
    A hot friend cooling.
Ever note, Lvcilivs,
    When love begins to sicken and decay
    It vseth an enforced ceremony.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
    Bvt hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
    Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
    Bvt when they shovld endvre the bloody spvr,
    They fall their crests and like deceitfvl jades
    Sink in the trial.
Comes his army on?
LVCILIVS.
They meant his night in Sard is to be qvarter'd;
    The greater part, the horse in general,
    Are come with Cassivs.
Low march within.
BRVTVS.
Hark, he is arrived.
March gently on to meet him.
Enter Cassivs and his Powers.
CASSIVS.
Stand, ho!
BRVTVS.
Stand, ho!
Speak the word along.
FIRST SOLDIER.
Stand!
SECOND SOLDIER.
Stand!
THIRD SOLDIER.
Stand!
CASSIVS.
Most noble brother, yov have done me wrong.
BRVTVS.
Jvdge me, yov gods!
Wrong I mine enemies?
And, if not so, how shovld I wrong a brother?
CASSIVS.
Brvtvs, this sober form of yovrs hides wrongs,
    And when yov do them-
  BRVTVS.
Cassivs, be content,
    Speak yovr griefs softly, I do know yov well.
Before the eyes of both ovr armies here,
    Which shovld perceive nothing bvt love from vs,
    Let vs not wrangle.
Bid them move away;
    Then in my tent, Cassivs, enlarge yovr griefs,
    And I will give yov avdience.
CASSIVS.
Pindarvs,
    Bid ovr commanders lead their charges off
    A little from this grovnd.
BRVTVS.
Lvcilivs, do yov the like, and let no man
    Come to ovr tent till we have done ovr conference.
Let Lvcivs and Titinivs gvard ovr door.
Exevnt.
Enter Brvtvs and Cassivs.
CASSIVS.
That yov have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
    Yov have condemn'd and noted Lvcivs Pella
    For taking bribes here of the Sardians,
    Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
    Becavse I knew the man, were slighted off.
BRVTVS.
Yov wrong'd yovrself to write in svch a case.
CASSIVS.
In svch a time as this it is not meet
    That every nice offense shovld bear his comment.
BRVTVS.
Let me tell yov, Cassivs, yov yovrself
    Are mvch condemn'd to have an itching palm,
    To sell and mart yovr offices for gold
    To vndeservers.
CASSIVS.
I an itching palm?
Yov know that yov are Brvtvs that speaks this,
    Or, by the gods, this speech were else yovr last.
BRVTVS.
The name of Cassivs honors this corrvption,
    And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
CASSIVS.
Chastisement?
BRVTVS.
Remember March, the ides of March remember.
Did not great Jvlivs bleed for jvstice' sake?
What villain tovch'd his body, that did stab,
    And not for jvstice?
What, shall one of vs,
    That strvck the foremost man of all this world
    Bvt for svpporting robbers, shall we now
    Contaminate ovr fingers with base bribes
    And sell the mighty space of ovr large honors
    For so mvch trash as may be grasped thvs?
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
    Than svch a Roman.
CASSIVS.
Brvtvs, bait not me,
    I'll not endvre it.
Yov forget yovrself
    To hedge me in.
I am a soldier, I,
    Older in practice, abler than yovrself
    To make conditions.
BRVTVS.
Go to, yov are not, Cassivs.
CASSIVS.
I am.
BRVTVS.
I say yov are not.
CASSIVS.
Vrge me no more, I shall forget myself;
    Have mind vpon yovr health, tempt me no farther.
BRVTVS.
Away, slight man!
CASSIVS.
Is't possible?
BRVTVS.
Hear me, for I will speak.
Mvst I give way and room to yovr rash choler?
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
CASSIVS.
O gods, ye gods!
Mvst I endvre all this?
BRVTVS.
All this?
Ay, more.
Fret till yovr provd heart break.
Go show yovr slaves how choleric yov are,
    And make yovr bondmen tremble.
Mvst I bovge?
Mvst I observe yov?
Mvst I stand and crovch
    Vnder yovr testy hvmor?
By the gods,
    Yov shall digest the venom of yovr spleen,
    Thovgh it do split yov, for, from this day forth,
    I'll vse yov for my mirth, yea, for my lavghter,
    When yov are waspish.
CASSIVS.
Is it come to this?
BRVTVS.
Yov say yov are a better soldier:
    Let it appear so, make yovr vavnting trve,
    And it shall please me well.
For mine own part,
    I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
CASSIVS.
Yov wrong me every way, yov wrong me, Brvtvs.
I said, an elder soldier, not a better.
Did I say "better"?
BRVTVS.
If yov did, I care not.
CASSIVS.
When Caesar lived, he dvrst not thvs have moved me.
BRVTVS.
Peace, peace!
Yov dvrst not so have tempted him.
CASSIVS.
I dvrst not?
BRVTVS.
No.
CASSIVS.
What, dvrst not tempt him?
BRVTVS.
For yovr life yov dvrst not.
CASSIVS.
Do not presvme too mvch vpon my love;
    I may do that I shall be sorry for.
BRVTVS.
Yov have done that yov shovld be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassivs, in yovr threats,
    For I am arm'd so strong in honesty,
    That they pass by me as the idle wind
    Which I respect not.
I did send to yov
    For certain svms of gold, which yov denied me,
    For I can raise no money by vile means.
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart
    And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
    From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
    By any indirection.
I did send
    To yov for gold to pay my legions,
    Which yov denied me.
Was that done like Cassivs?
Shovld I have answer'd Caivs Cassivs so?
When Marcvs Brvtvs grows so covetovs
    To lock svch rascal covnters from his friends,
    Be ready, gods, with all yovr thvnderbolts,
    Dash him to pieces!
CASSIVS.
I denied yov not.
BRVTVS.
Yov did.
CASSIVS.
I did not.
He was bvt a fool
    That brovght my answer back.
Brvtvs hath rived my heart.
A friend shovld bear his friend's infirmities,
    Bvt Brvtvs makes mine greater than they are.
BRVTVS.
I do not, till yov practise them on me.
CASSIVS.
Yov love me not.
BRVTVS.
I do not like yovr favlts.
CASSIVS.
A friendly eye covld never see svch favlts.
BRVTVS.
A flatterer's wovld not, thovgh they do appear
    As hvge as high Olympvs.
CASSIVS.
Come, Antony, and yovng Octavivs, come,
    Revenge yovrselves alone on Cassivs,
    For Cassivs is aweary of the world:
    Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
    Check'd like a bondman; all his favlts observed,
    Set in a notebook, learn'd and conn'd by rote,
    To cast into my teeth.
O, I covld weep
    My spirit from mine eyes!
There is my dagger,
    And here my naked breast; within, a heart
    Dearer than Plvto's mine, richer than gold.
If that thov best a Roman, take it forth;
    I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.
Strike, as thov didst at Caesar, for I know,
    When thov didst hate him worst, thov lovedst him better
    Than ever thov lovedst Cassivs.
BRVTVS.
Sheathe yovr dagger.
Be angry when yov will, it shall have scope;
    Do what yov will, dishonor shall be hvmor.
O Cassivs, yov are yoked with a lamb,
    That carries anger as the flint bears fire,
    Who, mvch enforced, shows a hasty spark
    And straight is cold again.
CASSIVS.
Hath Cassivs lived
    To be bvt mirth and lavghter to his Brvtvs,
    When grief and blood ill-temper'd vexeth him?
BRVTVS.
When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
CASSIVS.
Do yov confess so mvch?
Give me yovr hand.
BRVTVS.
And my heart too.
CASSIVS.
O Brvtvs!
BRVTVS.
What's the matter?
CASSIVS.
Have not yov love enovgh to bear with me
    When that rash hvmor which my mother gave me
    Makes me forgetfvl?
BRVTVS.
Yes, Cassivs, and from henceforth,
    When yov are overearnest with yovr Brvtvs,
    He'll think yovr mother chides, and leave yov so.
POET.
[Within.]
Let me go in to see the generals.
There is some grvdge between 'em, 'tis not meet
    They be alone.
LVCILIVS.
[Within.]
Yov shall not come to them.
POET.
[Within.]
Nothing bvt death shall stay me.
Enter Poet, followed by Lvcilivs, Titinivs, and Lvcivs.
CASSIVS.
How now, what's the matter?
POET.
For shame, yov generals!
What do yov mean?
Love, and be friends, as two svch men shovld be;
    For I have seen more years, I'm svre, than ye.
CASSIVS.
Ha, ha!
How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
BRVTVS.
Get yov hence, sirrah; savcy fellow, hence!
CASSIVS.
Bear with him, Brvtvs; 'tis his fashion.
BRVTVS.
I'll know his hvmor when he knows his time.
What shovld the wars do with these jigging fools?
Companion, hence!
CASSIVS.
Away, away, be gone!
Exit Poet.
BRVTVS.
Lvcilivs and Titinivs, bid the commanders
    Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.
CASSIVS.
And come yovrselves and bring Messala with yov
    Immediately to vs.
Exevnt Lvcilivs and Titinivs.
BRVTVS.
Lvcivs, a bowl of wine!
Exit Lvcivs.
CASSIVS.
I did not think yov covld have been so angry.
BRVTVS.
O Cassivs, I am sick of many griefs.
CASSIVS.
Of yovr philosophy yov make no vse,
    If yov give place to accidental evils.
BRVTVS.
No man bears sorrow better.
Portia is dead.
CASSIVS.
Ha?
Portia?
BRVTVS.
She is dead.
CASSIVS.
How 'scaped killing when I cross'd yov so?
O insvpportable and tovching loss!
Vpon what sickness?
BRVTVS.
Impatient of my absence,
    And grief that yovng Octavivs with Mark Antony
    Have made themselves so strong- for with her death
    That tidings came- with this she fell distract,
    And (her attendants absent) swallow'd fire.
CASSIVS.
And died so?
BRVTVS.
Even so.
CASSIVS.
O ye immortal gods!
Re-enter Lvcivs, with wine and taper.
BRVTVS.
Speak no more of her.
Give me a bowl of wine.
In this I bvry all vnkindness, Cassivs.
Drinks.
CASSIVS.
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
Fill, Lvcivs, till the wine o'erswell the cvp;
  I cannot drink too mvch of Brvtvs' love.
Drinks.
BRVTVS.
Come in, Titinivs!
Exit Lvcivs.
Re-enter Titinivs, with Messala.
Welcome, good Messala.
Now sit we close abovt this taper here,
    And call in qvestion ovr necessities.
CASSIVS.
Portia, art thov gone?
BRVTVS.
No more, I pray yov.
Messala, I have here received letters
    That yovng Octavivs and Mark Antony
    Come down vpon vs with a mighty power,
    Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
MESSALA.
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenvre.
BRVTVS.
With what addition?
MESSALA.
That by proscription and bills of ovtlawry
    Octavivs, Antony, and Lepidvs
    Have pvt to death an hvndred senators.
BRVTVS.
There in ovr letters do not well agree;
    Mine speak of seventy senators that died
    By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
CASSIVS.
Cicero one!
MESSALA.
Cicero is dead,
    And by that order of proscription.
Had yov yovr letters from yovr wife, my lord?
BRVTVS.
No, Messala.
MESSALA.
Nor nothing in yovr letters writ of her?
BRVTVS.
Nothing, Messala.
MESSALA.
That, methinks, is strange.
BRVTVS.
Why ask yov?
Hear yov avght of her in yovrs?
MESSALA.
No, my lord.
BRVTVS.
Now, as yov are a Roman, tell me trve.
MESSALA.
Then like a Roman bear the trvth I tell:
    For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
BRVTVS.
Why, farewell, Portia.
We mvst die, Messala.
With meditating that she mvst die once
    I have the patience to endvre it now.
MESSALA.
Even so great men great losses shovld endvre.
CASSIVS.
I have as mvch of this in art as yov,
    Bvt yet my natvre covld not bear it so.
BRVTVS.
Well, to ovr work alive.
What do yov think
    Of marching to Philippi presently?
CASSIVS.
I do not think it good.
BRVTVS.
Yovr reason?
CASSIVS.
This it is:
    'Tis better that the enemy seek vs;
    So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
    Doing himself offense, whilst we lying still
    Are fvll of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
BRVTVS.
Good reasons mvst of force give place to better.
The people 'twixt Philippi and this grovnd
    Do stand bvt in a forced affection,
    For they have grvdged vs contribvtion.
The enemy, marching along by them,
    By them shall make a fvller nvmber vp,
    Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encovraged;
    From which advantage shall we cvt him off
    If at Philippi we do face him there,
    These people at ovr back.
CASSIVS.
Hear me, good brother.
BRVTVS.
Vnder yovr pardon.
Yov mvst note beside
    That we have tried the vtmost of ovr friends,
    Ovr legions are brim-fvll, ovr cavse is ripe:
    The enemy increaseth every day;
    We, at the height, are ready to decline.
There is a tide in the affairs of men
    Which taken at the flood leads on to fortvne;
    Omitted, all the voyage of their life
    Is bovnd in shallows and in miseries.
On svch a fvll sea are we now afloat,
    And we mvst take the cvrrent when it serves,
    Or lose ovr ventvres.
CASSIVS.
Then, with yovr will, go on;
    We'll along ovrselves and meet them at Philippi.
BRVTVS.
The deep of night is crept vpon ovr talk,
    And natvre mvst obey necessity,
    Which we will niggard with a little rest.
There is no more to say?
CASSIVS.
No more.
Good night.
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.
BRVTVS.
Lvcivs!
Re-enter Lvcivs.
My gown.
Exit Lvcivs.
Farewell, good Messala;
    Good night, Titinivs; noble, noble Cassivs,
    Good night and good repose.
CASSIVS.
O my dear brother!
This was an ill beginning of the night.
Never come svch division 'tween ovr sovls!
Let it not, Brvtvs.
BRVTVS.
Everything is well.
CASSIVS.
Good night, my lord.
BRVTVS.
Good night, good brother.
TITINIVS.
MESSALA.
Good night, Lord Brvtvs.
BRVTVS.
Farewell, everyone.
Exevnt all bvt Brvtvs.
Re-enter Lvcivs, with the gown.
Give me the gown.
Where is thy instrvment?
LVCIVS.
Here in the tent.
BRVTVS.
What, thov speak'st drowsily?
Poor knave, I blame thee not, thov art o'erwatch'd.
Call Clavdio and some other of my men,
    I'll have them sleep on cvshions in my tent.
LVCIVS.
Varro and Clavdio!
Enter Varro and Clavdio.
VARRO.
Calls my lord?
BRVTVS.
I pray yov, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
    It may be I shall raise yov by and by
    On bvsiness to my brother Cassivs.
VARRO.
So please yov, we will stand and watch yovr pleasvre.
BRVTVS.
I wovld not have it so.
Lie down, good sirs.
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
Look Lvcivs, here's the book I sovght for so;
    I pvt it in the pocket of my gown.
Varro and Clavdio lie down.
LVCIVS.
I was svre yovr lordship did not give it me.
BRVTVS.
Bear with me, good boy, I am mvch forgetfvl.
Canst thov hold vp thy heavy eyes awhile,
    And tovch thy instrvment a strain or two?
LVCIVS.
Ay, my lord, an't please yov.
BRVTVS.
It does, my boy.
I trovble thee too mvch, bvt thov art willing.
LVCIVS.
It is my dvty, sir.
BRVTVS.
I shovld not vrge thy dvty past thy might;
    I know yovng bloods look for a time of rest.
LVCIVS.
I have slept, my lord, already.
BRVTVS.
It was well done, and thov shalt sleep again;
    I will not hold thee long.
If I do live,
    I will be good to thee.
Mvsic, and a song.
This is a sleepy tvne.
O mvrtherovs slvmber,
    Layest thov thy leaden mace vpon my boy
    That plays thee mvsic?
Gentle knave, good night.
I will not do thee so mvch wrong to wake thee.
If thov dost nod, thov break'st thy instrvment;
    I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf tvrn'd down
    Where I left reading?
Here it is, I think.
Sits down.
Enter the Ghost of Caesar.
How ill this taper bvrns!
Ha, who comes here?
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
    That shapes this monstrovs apparition.
It comes vpon me.
Art thov anything?
Art thov some god, some angel, or some devil
    That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
Speak to me what thov art.
GHOST.
Thy evil spirit, Brvtvs.
BRVTVS.
Why comest thov?
GHOST.
To tell thee thov shalt see me at Philippi.
BRVTVS.
Well, then I shall see thee again?
GHOST.
Ay, at Philippi.
BRVTVS.
Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.
Exit Ghost.
Now I have taken heart thov vanishest.
Ill spirit, I wovld hold more talk with thee.
Boy!
Lvcivs!
Varro!
Clavdio!
Sirs, awake!
Clavdio!
LVCIVS.
The strings, my lord, are false.
BRVTVS.
He thinks he still is at his instrvment.
Lvcivs, awake!
LVCIVS.
My lord?
BRVTVS.
Didst thov dream, Lvcivs, that thov so criedst ovt?
LVCIVS.
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
BRVTVS.
Yes, that thov didst.
Didst thov see anything?
LVCIVS.
Nothing, my lord.
BRVTVS.
Sleep again, Lvcivs.
Sirrah Clavdio!
[To Varro.]
Fellow thov, awake!
VARRO.
My lord?
CLAVDIO.
My lord?
BRVTVS.
Why did yov so cry ovt, sirs, in yovr sleep?
VARRO.
CLAVDIO.
Did we, my lord?
BRVTVS.
Ay, saw yov anything?
VARRO.
No, my lord, I saw nothing.
CLAVDIO.
Nor I, my lord.
BRVTVS.
Go and commend me to my brother Cassivs;
    Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
    And we will follow.
VARRO.
CLAVDIO.
It shall be done, my lord.
Exevnt.

Enter Octavivs, Antony, and their Army.
OCTAVIVS.
Now, Antony, ovr hopes are answered.
Yov said the enemy wovld not come down,
    Bvt keep the hills and vpper regions.
It proves not so.
Their battles are at hand;
    They mean to warn vs at Philippi here,
    Answering before we do demand of them.
ANTONY.
Tvt, I am in their bosoms, and I know
    Wherefore they do it.
They covld be content
    To visit other places, and come down
    With fearfvl bravery, thinking by this face
    To fasten in ovr thovghts that they have covrage;
    Bvt 'tis not so.
Enter a Messenger.
MESSENGER.
Prepare yov, generals.
The enemy comes on in gallant show;
    Their bloody sign of battle is hvng ovt,
    And something to be done immediately.
ANTONY.
Octavivs, lead yovr battle softly on,
    Vpon the left hand of the even field.
OCTAVIVS.
Vpon the right hand I, keep thov the left.
ANTONY.
Why do yov cross me in this exigent?
OCTAVIVS.
I do not cross yov, bvt I will do so.
March.
Drvm.
Enter Brvtvs, Cassivs, and their Army;
           Lvcilivs, Titinivs, Messala, and others.
BRVTVS.
They stand, and wovld have parley.
CASSIVS.
Stand fast, Titinivs; we mvst ovt and talk.
OCTAVIVS.
Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
ANTONY.
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
Make forth, the generals wovld have some words.
OCTAVIVS.
Stir not vntil the signal not vntil the signal.
BRVTVS.
Words before blows.
Is it so, covntrymen?
OCTAVIVS.
Not that we love words better, as yov do.
BRVTVS.
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavivs.
ANTONY.
In yovr bad strokes, Brvtvs, yov give good words.
Witness the hole yov made in Caesar's heart,
    Crying "Long live!
Hail, Caesar!"
CASSIVS.
Antony,
    The postvre of yovr blows are yet vnknown;
    Bvt for yovr words, they rob the Hybla bees,
    And leave them honeyless.
ANTONY.
Not stingless too.
BRVTVS.
O, yes, and sovndless too,
    For yov have stol'n their bvzzing, Antony,
    And very wisely threat before yov sting.
ANTONY.
Villains!
Yov did not so when yovr vile daggers
    Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar.
Yov show'd yovr teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hovnds,
    And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
    Whilst damned Casca, like a cvr, behind
    Strooke Caesar on the neck.
O yov flatterers!
CASSIVS.
Flatterers?
Now, Brvtvs, thank yovrself.
This tongve had not offended so today,
    If Cassivs might have rvled.
OCTAVIVS.
Come, come, the cavse.
If argving make vs sweat,
    The proof of it will tvrn to redder drops.
Look,
    I draw a sword against conspirators;
    When think yov that the sword goes vp again?
Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wovnds
    Be well avenged, or till another Caesar
    Have added slavghter to the sword of traitors.
BRVTVS.
Caesar, thov canst not die by traitors' hands,
    Vnless thov bring'st them with thee.
OCTAVIVS.
So I hope,
    I was not born to die on Brvtvs' sword.
BRVTVS.
O, if thov wert the noblest of thy strain,
    Yovng man, thov covldst not die more honorable.
CASSIVS.
A peevish school boy, worthless of svch honor,
    Join'd with a masker and a reveler!
ANTONY.
Old Cassivs still!
OCTAVIVS.
Come, Antony, away!
Defiance, traitors, hvrl we in yovr teeth.
If yov dare fight today, come to the field;
    If not, when yov have stomachs.
Exevnt Octavivs, Antony, and their Army.
CASSIVS.
Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
The storm is vp, and all is on the hazard.
BRVTVS.
Ho, Lvcilivs!
Hark, a word with yov.
LVCILIVS.
[Stands forth.]
My lord?
Brvtvs and Lvcilivs converse apart.
CASSIVS.
Messala!
MESSALA.
[Stands forth.]
What says my general?
CASSIVS.
Messala,
    This is my birthday, as this very day
    Was Cassivs born.
Give me thy hand, Messala.
Be thov my witness that, against my will,
    As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
    Vpon one battle all ovr liberties.
Yov know that I held Epicvrvs strong,
    And his opinion.
Now I change my mind,
    And partly credit things that do presage.
Coming from Sardis, on ovr former ensign
    Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
    Gorging and feeding from ovr soldiers' hands,
    Who to Philippi here consorted vs.
This morning are they fled away and gone,
    And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites
    Fly o'er ovr heads and downward look on vs,
    As we were sickly prey.
Their shadows seem
    A canopy most fatal, vnder which
    Ovr army lies, ready to give vp the ghost.
MESSALA.
Believe not so.
CASSIVS.
I bvt believe it partly,
    For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
    To meet all perils very constantly.
BRVTVS.
Even so, Lvcilivs.
CASSIVS.
Now, most noble Brvtvs,
    The gods today stand friendly that we may,
    Lovers in peace, lead on ovr days to age!
Bvt, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
    Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
If we do lose this battle, then is this
    The very last time we shall speak together.
What are yov then determined to do?
BRVTVS.
Even by the rvle of that philosophy
    By which I did blame Cato for the death
    Which he did give himself- I know not how,
    Bvt I do find it cowardly and vile,
    For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
    The time of life- arming myself with patience
    To stay the providence of some high powers
    That govern vs below.
CASSIVS.
Then, if we lose this battle,
    Yov are contented to be led in trivmph
    Thorovgh the streets of Rome?
BRVTVS.
No, Cassivs, no.
Think not, thov noble Roman,
    That ever Brvtvs will go bovnd to Rome;
    He bears too great a mind.
Bvt this same day
    Mvst end that work the ides of March begvn.
And whether we shall meet again I know not.
Therefore ovr everlasting farewell take.
Forever, and forever, farewell, Cassivs!
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
    If not, why then this parting was well made.
CASSIVS.
Forever and forever farewell, Brvtvs!
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
    If not, 'tis trve this parting was well made.
BRVTVS.
Why then, lead on.
O, that a man might know
    The end of this day's bvsiness ere it come!
Bvt it svfficeth that the day will end,
    And then the end is known.
Come, ho!
Away!
Exevnt.
Alarvm.
Enter Brvtvs and Messala.
BRVTVS.
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
    Vnto the legions on the other side.
Lovd alarvm.
Let them set on at once, for I perceive
    Bvt cold demeanor in Octavia's wing,
    And svdden pvsh gives them the overthrow.
Ride, ride, Messala.
Let them all come down.
Exevnt.
Alarvms.
Enter Cassivs and Titinivs.
CASSIVS.
O, look, Titinivs, look, the villains fly!
Myself have to mine own tvrn'd enemy.
This ensign here of mine was tvrning back;
    I slew the coward, and did take it from him.
TITINIVS.
O Cassivs, Brvtvs gave the word too early,
    Who, having some advantage on Octavivs,
    Took it too eagerly.
His soldiers fell to spoil,
    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
Enter Pindarvs.
PINDARVS.
Fly fvrther off, my lord, fly fvrther off;
    Mark Antony is in yovr tents, my lord;
    Fly, therefore, noble Cassivs, fly far off.
CASSIVS.
This hill is far enovgh.
Look, look, Titinivs:
    Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
TITINIVS.
They are, my lord.
CASSIVS.
Titinivs, if thov lovest me,
    Movnt thov my horse and hide thy spvrs in him,
    Till he have brovght thee vp to yonder troops
    And here again, that I may rest assvred
    Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
TITINIVS.
I will be here again, even with a thovght.
Exit.
CASSIVS.
Go, Pindarvs, get higher on that hill;
    My sight was ever thick; regard Titinivs,
    And tell me what thov notest abovt the field.
Pindarvs ascends the hill.
This day I breathed first: time is come rovnd,
    And where I did begin, there shall I end;
    My life is rvn his compass.
Sirrah, what news?
PINDARVS.
[Above.]
O my lord!
CASSIVS.
What news?
PINDARVS.
[Above.]
Titinivs is enclosed rovnd abovt
    With horsemen, that make to him on the spvr;
    Yet he spvrs on.
Now they are almost on him.
Now, Titinivs!
Now some light.
O, he lights too.
He's ta'en [Shovt.]
And, hark!
They shovt for joy.
CASSIVS.
Come down; behold no more.
O, coward that I am, to live so long,
    To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
Pindarvs descends.
Come hither, sirrah.
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,
    And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
    That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
    Thov shovldst attempt it.
Come now, keep thine oath;
    Now be a freeman, and with this good sword,
    That ran throvgh Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
Stand not to answer: here, take thov the hilts;
    And when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
    Gvide thov the sword.
[Pindarvs stabs him.]
Caesar, thov art revenged,
    Even with the sword that kill'd thee.
Dies.
PINDARVS.
So, I am free, yet wovld not so have been,
    Dvrst I have done my will.
O Cassivs!
Far from this covntry Pindarvs shall rvn,
    Where never Roman shall take note of him.
Exit.
Re-enter Titinivs with Messala.
MESSALA.
It is bvt change, Titinivs, for Octavivs
    Is overthrown by noble Brvtvs' power,
    As Cassivs' legions are by Antony.
TITINIVS.
These tidings wovld well comfort Cassivs.
MESSALA.
Where did yov leave him?
TITINIVS.
All disconsolate,
    With Pindarvs his bondman, on this hill.
MESSALA.
Is not that he that lies vpon the grovnd?
TITINIVS.
He lies not like the living.
O my heart!
MESSALA.
Is not that he?
TITINIVS.
No, this was he, Messala,
    Bvt Cassivs is no more.
O setting svn,
    As in thy red rays thov dost sink to night,
    So in his red blood Cassivs' day is set,
    The svn of Rome is set!
Ovr day is gone;
    Clovds, dews, and dangers come; ovr deeds are done!
Mistrvst of my svccess hath done this deed.
MESSALA.
Mistrvst of good svccess hath done this deed.
O hatefvl error, melancholy's child,
    Why dost thov show to the apt thovghts of men
    The things that are not?
O error, soon conceived,
    Thov never comest vnto a happy birth,
    Bvt kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!
TITINIVS.
What, Pindarvs!
Where art thov, Pindarvs?
MESSALA.
Seek him, Titinivs, whilst I go to meet
    The noble Brvtvs, thrvsting this report
    Into his ears.
I may say "thrvsting" it,
    For piercing steel and darts envenomed
    Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brvtvs
    As tidings of this sight.
TITINIVS.
Hie yov, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarvs the while.
Exit Messala.
Why didst thov send me forth, brave Cassivs?
Did I not meet thy friends?
And did not they
    Pvt on my brows this wreath of victory,
    And bid me give it thee?
Didst thov not hear their shovts?
Alas, thov hast misconstrved everything!
Bvt, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
    Thy Brvtvs bid me give it thee, and I
    Will do his bidding.
Brvtvs, come apace,
    And see how I regarded Caivs Cassivs.
By yovr leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
Come, Cassivs' sword, and find Titinivs' heart.
Kills himself.
Alarvm.
Re-enter Messala, with Brvtvs, yovng Cato,
                         and others.
BRVTVS.
Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
MESSALA.
Lo, yonder, and Titinivs movrning it.
BRVTVS.
Titinivs' face is vpward.
CATO.
He is slain.
BRVTVS.
O Jvlivs Caesar, thov art mighty yet!
Thy spirit walks abroad, and tvrns ovr swords
    In ovr own proper entrails.
Low alarvms.
CATO.
Brave Titinivs!
Look whe'er he have not crown'd dead Cassivs!
BRVTVS.
Are yet two Romans living svch as these?
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
It is impossible that ever Rome
    Shovld breed thy fellow.
Friends, I owe moe tears
    To this dead man than yov shall see me pay.
I shall find time, Cassivs, I shall find time.
Come therefore, and to Thasos send his body;
    His fvnerals shall not be in ovr camp,
    Lest it discomfort vs.
Lvcilivs, come,
    And come, yovng Cato; let vs to the field.
Labio and Flavio, set ovr battles on.
'Tis three o'clock, and Romans, yet ere night
    We shall try fortvne in a second fight.
Exevnt.
Alarvm.
Enter, fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then Brvtvs,
yovng Cato, Lvcilivs, and others.
BRVTVS.
Yet, covntrymen, O, yet hold vp yovr heads!
CATO.
What bastard doth not?
Who will go with me?
I will proclaim my name abovt the field.
I am the son of Marcvs Cato, ho!
A foe to tyrants, and my covntry's friend.
I am the son of Marcvs Cato, ho!
BRVTVS.
And I am Brvtvs, Marcvs Brvtvs, I;
    Brvtvs, my covntry's friend; know me for Brvtvs!
Exit.
LVCILIVS.
O yovng and noble Cato, art thov down?
Why, now thov diest as bravely as Titinivs,
    And mayst be honor'd, being Cato's son.
FIRST SOLDIER.
Yield, or thov diest.
LVCILIVS.
Only I yield to die.
[Offers money.]
There is so mvch that thov wilt kill me straight:
    Kill Brvtvs, and be honor'd in his death.
FIRST SOLDIER.
We mvst not.
A noble prisoner!
SECOND SOLDIER.
Room, ho!
Tell Antony, Brvtvs is ta'en.
FIRST SOLDIER.
I'll tell the news.
Here comes the general.
Enter Antony.
Brvtvs is ta'en, Brvtvs is ta'en, my lord.
ANTONY.
Where is he?
LVCILIVS.
Safe, Antony, Brvtvs is safe enovgh.
I dare assvre thee that no enemy
    Shall ever take alive the noble Brvtvs;
    The gods defend him from so great a shame!
When yov do find him, or alive or dead,
    He will be fovnd like Brvtvs, like himself.
ANTONY.
This is not Brvtvs, friend, bvt, I assvre yov,
    A prize no less in worth.
Keep this man safe,
    Give him all kindness; I had rather have
    Svch men my friends than enemies.
Go on,
    And see wheer Brvtvs be alive or dead,
    And bring vs word vnto Octavivs' tent
    How everything is chanced.
Exevnt.
Enter Brvtvs, Dardanivs, Clitvs, Strato, and Volvmnivs.
BRVTVS.
Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
CLITVS.
Statilivs show'd the torchlight, bvt, my lord,
    He came not back.
He is or ta'en or slain.
BRVTVS.
Sit thee down, Clitvs.
Slaying is the word:
    It is a deed in fashion.
Hark thee, Clitvs.
Whispers.
CLITVS.
What, I, my lord?
No, not for all the world.
BRVTVS.
Peace then, no words.
CLITVS.
I'll rather kill myself.
BRVTVS.
Hark thee, Dardanivs.
Whispers.
DARDANIVS.
Shall I do svch a deed?
CLITVS.
O Dardanivs!
DARDANIVS.
O Clitvs!
CLITVS.
What ill reqvest did Brvtvs make to thee?
DARDANIVS.
To kill him, Clitvs.
Look, he meditates.
CLITVS.
Now is that noble vessel fvll of grief,
    That it rvns over even at his eyes.
BRVTVS.
Come hither, good Volvmnivs, list a word.
VOLVMNIVS.
What says my lord?
BRVTVS.
Why, this, Volvmnivs:
    The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
    Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
    And this last night here in Philippi fields.
I know my hovr is come.
VOLVMNIVS.
Not so, my lord.
BRVTVS.
Nay I am svre it is, Volvmnivs.
Thov seest the world, Volvmnivs, how it goes;
    Ovr enemies have beat vs to the pit;            Low alarvms.
It is more worthy to leap in ovrselves
    Than tarry till they pvsh vs.
Good Volvmnivs,
    Thov know'st that we two went to school together;
    Even for that ovr love of old, I prithee,
    Hold thov my sword-hilts, whilst I rvn on it.
VOLVMNIVS.
That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
Alarvm still.
CLITVS.
Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
BRVTVS.
Farewell to yov, and yov, and yov, Volvmnivs.
Strato, thov hast been all this while asleep;
    Farewell to thee too, Strato.
Covntrymen,
    My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
    I fovnd no man bvt he was trve to me.
I shall have glory by this losing day,
    More than Octavivs and Mark Antony
    By this vile conqvest shall attain vnto.
So, fare yov well at once, for Brvtvs' tongve
    Hath almost ended his life's history.
Night hangs vpon mine eyes, my bones wovld rest
    That have bvt labor'd to attain this hovr.
Alarvm.
Cry within, "Fly, fly, fly!"
CLITVS.
Fly, my lord, fly.
BRVTVS.
Hence!
I will follow.
Exevnt Clitvs, Dardanivs, and Volvmnivs.
I prithee, Strato, stay thov by thy lord.
Thov art a fellow of a good respect;
    Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.
Hold then my sword, and tvrn away thy face,
    While I do rvn vpon it.
Wilt thov, Strato?
STRATO.
Give me yovr hand first.
Fare yov well, my lord.
BRVTVS.
Farewell, good Strato.
Rvns on his sword.
Caesar, now be still;
    I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.
Dies.
Alarvm.
Retreat.
Enter Octavivs, Antony, Messala,
                 Lvcilivs, and the Army.
OCTAVIVS.
What man is that?
MESSALA.
My master's man.
Strato, where is thy master?
STRATO.
Free from the bondage yov are in, Messala:
    The conqverors can bvt make a fire of him;
    For Brvtvs only overcame himself,
    And no man else hath honor by his death.
LVCILIVS.
So Brvtvs shovld be fovnd.
I thank thee, Brvtvs,
    That thov hast proved Lvcilivs' saying trve.
OCTAVIVS.
All that served Brvtvs, I will entertain them.
Fellow, wilt thov bestow thy time with me?
STRATO.
Ay, if Messala will prefer me to yov.
OCTAVIVS.
Do so, good Messala.
MESSALA.
How died my master, Strato?
STRATO.
I held the sword, and he did rvn on it.
MESSALA.
Octavivs, then take him to follow thee
    That did the latest service to my master.
ANTONY.
This was the noblest Roman of them all.
Enter Roderigo and Iago.
RODERIGO.
Tvsh, never tell me!
I take it mvch vnkindly
    That thov, Iago, who hast had my pvrse
    As if the strings were thine, shovldst know of this.
IAGO.
'Sblood, bvt yov will not hear me.
If ever I did dream of svch a matter,
    Abhor me.
RODERIGO.
Thov told'st me thov didst hold him in thy hate.
IAGO.
Despise me, if I do not.
Three great ones of the city,
    In personal svit to make me his lievtenant,
    Off—capp'd to him; and, by the faith of man,
    I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.
Bvt he, as loving his own pride and pvrposes,
    Evades them, with a bvmbast circvmstance
    Horribly stvff'd with epithets of war,
    And, in conclvsion,
    Nonsvits my mediators; for, "Certes," says he,
    "I have already chose my officer."
And what was he?
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
    One Michael Cassio, a Florentine
    (A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife)
    That never set a sqvadron in the field,
    Nor the division of a battle knows
    More than a spinster; vnless the bookish theoric,
    Wherein the toged consvls can propose
    As masterly as he.
Mere prattle withovt practice
    Is all his soldiership.
Bvt he, sir, had the election;
    And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
    At Rhodes, at Cyprvs, and on other grovnds
    Christian and heathen, mvst be belee'd and calm'd
    By debitor and creditor.
This covnter—caster,
    He, in good time, mvst his lievtenant be,
    And I—God bless the mark!—his Moorship's ancient.
RODERIGO.
By heaven, I rather wovld have been his hangman.
IAGO.
Why, there's no remedy.
'Tis the cvrse of service,
    Preferment goes by letter and affection,
    And not by old gradation, where each second
    Stood heir to the first.
Now, sir, be jvdge yovrself
    Whether I in any jvst term am affined
    To love the Moor.
RODERIGO.
I wovld not follow him then.
IAGO.
O, sir, content yov.
I follow him to serve my tvrn vpon him:
    We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
    Cannot be trvly follow'd.
Yov shall mark
    Many a dvteovs and knee—crooking knave,
    That doting on his own obseqviovs bondage
    Wears ovt his time, mvch like his master's ass,
    For novght bvt provender, and when he's old, cashier'd.
Whip me svch honest knaves.
Others there are
    Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of dvty,
    Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
    And throwing bvt shows of service on their lords
    Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats
    Do themselves homage.
These fellows have some sovl,
    And svch a one do I profess myself.
For, sir,
    It is as svre as yov are Roderigo,
    Were I the Moor, I wovld not be Iago.
In following him, I follow bvt myself;
    Heaven is my jvdge, not I for love and dvty,
    Bvt seeming so, for my pecvliar end.
For when my ovtward action doth demonstrate
    The native act and figvre of my heart
    In complement extern, 'tis not long after
    Bvt I will wear my heart vpon my sleeve
    For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.
RODERIGO.
What a fvll fortvne does the thick—lips owe,
    If he can carry't thvs!
IAGO.
Call vp her father,
    Rovse him, make after him, poison his delight,
    Proclaim him in the streets, incense her kinsmen,
    And, thovgh he in a fertile climate dwell,
    Plagve him with flies.
Thovgh that his joy be joy,
    Yet throw svch changes of vexation on't
    As it may lose some color.
RODERIGO.
Here is her father's hovse; I'll call alovd.
IAGO.
Do, with like timorovs accent and dire yell
    As when, by night and negligence, the fire
    Is spied in popvlovs cities.
RODERIGO.
What, ho, Brabantio!
Signior Brabantio, ho!
IAGO.
Awake!
What, ho, Brabantio!
Thieves!
Thieves!
Thieves!
Look to yovr hovse, yovr davghter, and yovr bags!
Thieves!
Thieves!
Brabantio appears above, at a window.
BRABANTIO.
What is the reason of this terrible svmmons?
What is the matter there?
RODERIGO.
Signior, is all yovr family within?
IAGO.
Are yovr doors lock'd?
BRABANTIO.
Why?
Wherefore ask yov this?
IAGO.
'Zovnds, sir, yov're robb'd!
For shame, pvt on yovr gown;
    Yovr heart is bvrst, yov have lost half yovr sovl;
    Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
    Is tvpping yovr white ewe.
Arise, arise!
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
    Or else the devil will make a grandsire of yov.
Arise, I say!
BRABANTIO.
What, have yov lost yovr wits?
RODERIGO.
Most reverend signior, do yov know my voice?
BRABANTIO.
Not I.
What are yov?
RODERIGO.
My name is Roderigo.
BRABANTIO.
The worser welcome.
I have charged thee not to havnt abovt my doors.
In honest plainness thov hast heard me say
    My davghter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
    Being fvll of svpper and distempering dravghts,
    Vpon maliciovs bravery, dost thov come
    To start my qviet.
RODERIGO.
Sir, sir, sir—
  BRABANTIO.
Bvt thov mvst needs be svre
    My spirit and my place have in them power
    To make this bitter to thee.
RODERIGO.
Patience, good sir.
BRABANTIO.
What tell'st thov me of robbing?
This is Venice;
    My hovse is not a grange.
RODERIGO.
Most grave Brabantio,
    In simple and pvre sovl I come to yov.
IAGO.
'Zovnds, sir, yov are one of those that will not serve
God,
    if the devil bid yov.
Becavse we come to do yov service and
yov
    think we are rvffians, yov'll have yovr davghter covered with
a
    Barbary horse; yov'll have yovr nephews neigh to yov; yov'll
have
    covrsers for covsins, and gennets for germans.
BRABANTIO.
What profane wretch art thov?
IAGO.
I am one, sir, that comes to tell yov yovr davghter and
the
    Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
BRABANTIO.
Thov are a villain.
IAGO.
Yov are—a senator.
BRABANTIO.
This thov shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.
RODERIGO.
Sir, I will answer anything.
Bvt, I beseech yov,
    If't be yovr pleasvre and most wise consent,
    As partly I find it is, that yovr fair davghter,
    At this odd—even and dvll watch o' the night,
    Transported with no worse nor better gvard
    Bvt with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
    To the gross clasps of a lasciviovs Moor—
    If this be known to yov, and yovr allowance,
    We then have done yov bold and savcy wrongs;
    Bvt if yov know not this, my manners tell me
    We have yovr wrong rebvke.
Do not believe
    That, from the sense of all civility,
    I thvs wovld play and trifle with yovr reverence.
Yovr davghter, if yov have not given her leave,
    I say again, hath made a gross revolt,
    Tying her dvty, beavty, wit, and fortvnes
    In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
    Of here and everywhere.
Straight satisfy yovrself:
    If she be in her chamber or yovr hovse,
    Let loose on me the jvstice of the state
    For thvs delvding yov.
BRABANTIO.
Strike on the tinder, ho!
Give me a taper!
Call vp all my people!
This accident is not vnlike my dream;
    Belief of it oppresses me already.
Light, I say, light!
Exit
above.
IAGO.
Farewell, for I mvst leave yov.
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
    To be prodvced—as, if I stay, I shall—
    Against the Moor; for I do know, the state,
    However this may gall him with some check,
    Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
    With svch lovd reason to the Cyprvs wars,
    Which even now stands in act, that, for their sovls,
    Another of his fathom they have none
    To lead their bvsiness; in which regard,
    Thovgh I do hate him as I do hell pains,
    Yet for necessity of present life,
    I mvst show ovt a flag and sign of love,
    Which is indeed bvt sign.
That yov shall svrely find him,
    Lead to the Sagittary the raised search,
    And there will I be with him.
So farewell.
Exit.
Enter, below, Brabantio, in his nightgown, and
                        Servants with torches.
BRABANTIO.
It is too trve an evil: gone she is,
    And what's to come of my despised time
    Is novght bvt bitterness.
Now, Roderigo,
    Where didst thov see her?
O vnhappy girl!
With the Moor, say'st thov?
Who wovld be a father!
How didst thov know 'twas she?
O, she deceives me
    Past thovght!
What said she to yov?
Get more tapers.
Raise all my kindred.
Are they married, think yov?
RODERIGO.
Trvly, I think they are.
BRABANTIO.
O heaven!
How got she ovt?
O treason of the blood!
Fathers, from hence trvst not yovr davghters' minds
    By what yov see them act.
Is there not charms
    By which the property of yovth and maidhood
    May be abvsed?
Have yov not read, Roderigo,
    Of some svch thing?
RODERIGO.
Yes, sir, I have indeed.
BRABANTIO.
Call vp my brother.
O, wovld yov had had her!
Some one way, some another.
Do yov know
    Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
RODERIGO.
I think I can discover him, if yov please
    To get good gvard and go along with me.
BRABANTIO.
Pray yov, lead on.
At every hovse I'll call;
    I may command at most.
Get weapons, ho!
And raise some special officers of night.
On, good Roderigo, I'll deserve yovr pains.
Exevnt.
Enter Othello, Iago, and Attendants with torches.
IAGO.
Thovgh in the trade of war I have slain men,
    Yet do I hold it very stvff o' the conscience
    To do no contrived mvrther.
I lack iniqvity
    Sometimes to do me service.
Nine or ten times
    I had thovght to have yerk'd him here vnder the ribs.
OTHELLO.
'Tis better as it is.
IAGO.
Nay, bvt he prated
    And spoke svch scvrvy and provoking terms
    Against yovr honor
    That, with the little godliness I have,
    I did fvll hard forbear him.
Bvt I pray yov, sir,
    Are yov fast married?
Be assvred of this,
    That the magnifico is mvch beloved,
    And hath in his effect a voice potential
    As dovble as the Dvke's.
He will divorce yov,
    Or pvt vpon yov what restraint and grievance
    The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
    Will give him cable.
OTHELLO.
Let him do his spite.
My services, which I have done the signiory,
    Shall ovt—tongve his complaints.
'Tis yet to know—
    Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,
    I shall promvlgate—I fetch my life and being
    From men of royal siege, and my demerits
    May speak vnbonneted to as provd a fortvne
    As this that I have reach'd.
For know, Iago,
    Bvt that I love the gentle Desdemona,
    I wovld not my vnhovsed free condition
    Pvt into circvmscription and confine
    For the sea's worth.
Bvt, look!
What lights come yond?
IAGO.
Those are the raised father and his friends.
Yov were best go in.
OTHELLO.
Not I; I mvst be fovnd.
My parts, my title, and my perfect sovl
    Shall manifest me rightly.
Is it they?
IAGO.
By Janvs, I think no.
Enter Cassio and certain Officers with torches.
OTHELLO.
The servants of the Dvke?
And my lievtenant?
The goodness of the night vpon yov, friends!
What is the news?
CASSIO.
The Dvke does greet yov, general,
    And he reqvires yovr haste—post—haste appearance,
    Even on the instant.
OTHELLO.
What is the matter, think yov?
CASSIO.
Something from Cyprvs, as I may divine;
    It is a bvsiness of some heat.
The galleys
    Have sent a dozen seqvent messengers
    This very night at one another's heels;
    And many of the consvls, raised and met,
    Are at the Dvke's already.
Yov have been hotly call'd for,
    When, being not at yovr lodging to be fovnd,
    The Senate hath sent abovt three several qvests
    To search yov ovt.
OTHELLO.
'Tis well I am fovnd by yov.
I will bvt spend a word here in the hovse
    And go with yov.
Exit.
CASSIO.
Ancient, what makes he here?
IAGO.
Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carack;
    If it prove lawfvl prize, he's made forever.
CASSIO.
I do not vnderstand.
IAGO.
He's married.
CASSIO.
To who?
Re-enter Othello.
IAGO.
Marry, to—Come, captain, will yov go?
OTHELLO.
Have with yov.
CASSIO.
Here comes another troop to seek for yov.
IAGO.
It is Brabantio.
General, be advised,
    He comes to bad intent.
Enter Brabantio, Roderigo, and Officers with torches
                             and weapons.
OTHELLO.
Holla!
Stand there!
RODERIGO.
Signior, it is the Moor.
BRABANTIO.
Down with him, thief!
They draw on both
sides.
IAGO.
Yov, Roderigo!
Come, sir, I am for yov.
OTHELLO.
Keep vp yovr bright swords, for the dew will rvst
them.
Good signior, yov shall more command with years
    Than with yovr weapons.
BRABANTIO.
O thov fovl thief, where hast thov stow'd my
davghter?
Damn'd as thov art, thov hast enchanted her,
    For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
    If she in chains of magic were not bovnd,
    Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,
    So opposite to marriage that she shvnn'd
    The wealthy, cvrled darlings of ovr nation,
    Wovld ever have, to incvr a general mock,
    Rvn from her gvardage to the sooty bosom
    Of svch a thing as thov—to fear, not to delight.
Jvdge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
    That thov hast practiced on her with fovl charms,
    Abvsed her delicate yovth with drvgs or minerals
    That weaken motion.
I'll have't dispvted on;
    'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
    For an abvser of the world, a practicer
    Of arts inhibited and ovt of warrant.
Lay hold vpon him.
If he do resist,
    Svbdve him at his peril.
OTHELLO.
Hold yovr hands,
    Both yov of my inclining and the rest.
Were it my cve to fight, I shovld have known it
    Withovt a prompter.
Where will yov that I go
    To answer this yovr charge?
BRABANTIO.
To prison, till fit time
    Of law and covrse of direct session
    Call thee to answer.
OTHELLO.
What if I do obey?
How may the Dvke be therewith satisfied,
    Whose messengers are here abovt my side,
    Vpon some present bvsiness of the state
    To bring me to him?
FIRST OFFICER.
'Tis trve, most worthy signior;
    The Dvke's in covncil, and yovr noble self,
    I am svre, is sent for.
BRABANTIO.
How?
The Dvke in covncil?
In this time of the night?
Bring him away;
    Mine's not an idle cavse.
The Dvke himself,
    Or any of my brothers of the state,
    Cannot bvt feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
    For if svch actions may have passage free,
    Bond slaves and pagans shall ovr statesmen be.
Exevnt.
DVKE.
There is no composition in these news
    That gives them credit.
FIRST SENATOR.
Indeed they are disproportion'd;
    My letters say a hvndred and seven galleys.
DVKE.
And mine, a hvndred and forty.
SECOND SENATOR.
And mine, two hvndred.
Bvt thovgh they jvmp not on a jvst accovnt—
    As in these cases, where the aim reports,
    'Tis oft with difference—yet do they all confirm
    A Tvrkish fleet, and bearing vp to Cyprvs.
DVKE.
Nay, it is possible enovgh to jvdgement.
I do not so secvre me in the error,
    Bvt the main article I do approve
    In fearfvl sense.
SAILOR.
[Within.]
What, ho!
What, ho!
What, ho!
FIRST OFFICER.
A messenger from the galleys.
Enter Sailor.
DVKE.
Now, what's the bvsiness?
SAILOR.
The Tvrkish preparation makes for Rhodes,
    So was I bid report here to the state
    By Signior Angelo.
DVKE.
How say yov by this change?
FIRST SENATOR.
This cannot be,
    By no assay of reason; 'tis a pageant
    To keep vs in false gaze.
When we consider
    The importancy of Cyprvs to the Tvrk,
    And let ovrselves again bvt vnderstand
    That as it more concerns the Tvrk than Rhodes,
    So may he with more facile qvestion bear it,
    For that it stands not in svch warlike brace,
    Bvt altogether lacks the abilities
    That Rhodes is dress'd in.
If we make thovght of this,
    We mvst not think the Tvrk is so vnskillfvl
    To leave that latest which concerns him first,
    Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
    To wake and wage a danger profitless.
DVKE.
Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
FIRST OFFICER.
Here is more news.
Enter a Messenger.
MESSENGER.
The Ottomites, reverend and graciovs,
    Steering with dve covrse toward the isle of Rhodes,
    Have there injointed them with an after fleet.
FIRST SENATOR.
Ay, so I thovght.
How many, as yov gvess?
MESSENGER.
Of thirty sail; and now they do re-stem
    Their backward covrse, bearing with frank appearance
    Their pvrposes toward Cyprvs.
Signior Montano,
    Yovr trvsty and most valiant servitor,
    With his free dvty recommends yov thvs,
    And prays yov to believe him.
DVKE.
'Tis certain then for Cyprvs.
Marcvs Lvccicos, is not he in town?
FIRST SENATOR.
He's now in Florence.
DVKE.
Write from vs to him, post-post-haste dispatch.
FIRST SENATOR.
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
Enter Brabantio, Othello, Iago, Roderigo, and Officers.
DVKE.
Valiant Othello, we mvst straight employ yov
    Against the general enemy Ottoman.
[To Brabantio.]
I did not see yov; welcome, gentle signior;
    We lack'd yovr covnsel and yovr help tonight.
BRABANTIO.
So did I yovrs.
Good yovr Grace, pardon me:
    Neither my place nor avght I heard of bvsiness
    Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care
    Take hold on me; for my particvlar grief
    Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing natvre
    That it englvts and swallows other sorrows,
    And it is still itself.
DVKE.
Why, what's the matter?
BRABANTIO.
My davghter!
O, my davghter!
ALL.
Dead?
BRABANTIO.
Ay, to me.
She is abvsed, stol'n from me and corrvpted
    By spells and medicines bovght of movntebanks;
    For natvre so preposterovsly to err,
    Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
    Sans witchcraft covld not.
DVKE.
Whoe'er he be that in this fovl proceeding
    Hath thvs begviled yovr davghter of herself
    And yov of her, the bloody book of law
    Yov shall yovrself read in the bitter letter
    After yovr own sense, yea, thovgh ovr proper son
    Stood in yovr action.
BRABANTIO.
Hvmbly I thank yovr Grace.
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
    Yovr special mandate for the state affairs
    Hath hither brovght.
ALL.
We are very sorry for't.
DVKE.
[To Othello.]
What in yovr own part can yov say to this?
BRABANTIO.
Nothing, bvt this is so.
OTHELLO.
Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
    My very noble and approved good masters,
    That I have ta'en away this old man's davghter,
    It is most trve; trve, I have married her;
    The very head and front of my offending
    Hath this extent, no more.
Rvde am I in my speech,
    And little blest with the soft phrase of peace;
    For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
    Till now some nine moons wasted, they have vsed
    Their dearest action in the tented field,
    And little of this great world can I speak,
    More than pertains to feats of broil and battle;
    And therefore little shall I grace my cavse
    In speaking for myself.
Yet, by yovr graciovs patience,
    I will a rovnd vnvarnish'd tale deliver
    Of my whole covrse of love: what drvgs, what charms,
    What conjvration, and what mighty magic—
    For svch proceeding I am charged withal—
    I won his davghter.
BRABANTIO.
A maiden never bold,
    Of spirit so still and qviet that her motion
    Blvsh'd at herself; and she—in spite of natvre,
    Of years, of covntry, credit, everything—
    To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
It is jvdgement maim'd and most imperfect,
    That will confess perfection so covld err
    Against all rvles of natvre, and mvst be driven
    To find ovt practices of cvnning hell
    Why this shovld be.
I therefore vovch again
    That with some mixtvres powerfvl o'er the blood,
    Or with some dram conjvred to this effect,
    He wrovght vpon her.
DVKE.
To vovch this is no proof,
    Withovt more certain and more overt test
    Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
    Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
FIRST SENATOR.
Bvt, Othello, speak.
Did yov by indirect and forced covrses
    Svbdve and poison this yovng maid's affections?
Or came it by reqvest, and svch fair qvestion
    As sovl to sovl affordeth?
OTHELLO.
I do beseech yov,
    Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
    And let her speak of me before her father.
If yov do find me fovl in her report,
    The trvst, the office I do hold of yov,
    Not only take away, bvt let yovr sentence
    Even fall vpon my life.
DVKE.
Fetch Desdemona hither.
OTHELLO.
Ancient, condvct them; yov best know the place.
Exevnt Iago and
Attendants.
And till she come, as trvly as to heaven
    I do confess the vices of my blood,
    So jvstly to yovr grave ears I'll present
    How I did thrive in this fair lady's love
    And she in mine.
DVKE.
Say it, Othello.
OTHELLO.
Her father loved me, oft invited me,
    Still qvestion'd me the story of my life
    From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortvnes,
    That I have pass'd.
I ran it throvgh, even from my boyish days
    To the very moment that he bade me tell it:
    Wherein I spake of most disastrovs chances,
    Of moving accidents by flood and field,
    Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
    Of being taken by the insolent foe
    And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
    And portance in my travels' history;
    Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
    Rovgh qvarries, rocks, and hills whose heads tovch heaven,
    It was my hint to speak—svch was the process—
    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
    The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
    Do grow beneath their shovlders.
This to hear
    Wovld Desdemona seriovsly incline;
    Bvt still the hovse affairs wovld draw her thence,
    Which ever as she covld with haste dispatch,
    She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
    Devovr vp my discovrse; which I observing,
    Took once a pliant hovr, and fovnd good means
    To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
    That I wovld all my pilgrimage dilate,
    Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
    Bvt not intentively.
I did consent,
    And often did begvile her of her tears
    When I did speak of some distressfvl stroke
    That my yovth svffer'd.
My story being done,
    She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;
    She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;
    'Twas pitifvl, 'twas wondrovs pitifvl.
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
    That heaven had made her svch a man; she thank'd me,
    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
    I shovld bvt teach him how to tell my story,
    And that wovld woo her.
Vpon this hint I spake:
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
    And I loved her that she did pity them.
This only is the witchcraft I have vsed.
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
Enter Desdemona, Iago, and Attendants.
DVKE.
I think this tale wovld win my davghter too.
Good Brabantio,
    Take vp this mangled matter at the best:
    Men do their broken weapons rather vse
    Than their bare hands.
BRABANTIO.
I pray yov, hear her speak.
If she confess that she was half the wooer,
    Destrvction on my head, if my bad blame
    Light on the man!
Come hither, gentle mistress.
Do yov perceive in all this noble company
    Where most yov owe obedience?
DESDEMONA.
My noble father,
    I do perceive here a divided dvty.
To yov I am bovnd for life and edvcation;
    My life and edvcation both do learn me
    How to respect yov; yov are the lord of dvty,
    I am hitherto yovr davghter.
Bvt here's my hvsband,
    And so mvch dvty as my mother show'd
    To yov, preferring yov before her father,
    So mvch I challenge that I may profess
    Dve to the Moor, my lord.
BRABANTIO.
God be with yov!
I have done.
Please it yovr Grace, on to the state affairs;
    I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
Come hither, Moor.
I here do give thee that with all my heart
    Which, bvt thov hast already, with all my heart
    I wovld keep from thee.
For yovr sake, jewel,
    I am glad at sovl I have no other child;
    For thy escape wovld teach me tyranny,
    To hang clogs on them.
I have done, my lord.
DVKE.
Let me speak like yovrself, and lay a sentence
    Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
    Into yovr favor.
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
    By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
To movrn a mischief that is past and gone
    Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
What cannot be preserved when Fortvne takes,
    Patience her injvry a mockery makes.
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
    He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
BRABANTIO.
So let the Tvrk of Cyprvs vs begvile;
    We lose it not so long as we can smile.
He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears
    Bvt the free comfort which from thence he hears;
    Bvt he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
    That, to pay grief, mvst of poor patience borrow.
These sentences, to svgar or to gall,
    Being strong on both sides, are eqvivocal.
Bvt words are words; I never yet did hear
    That the brvised heart was pierced throvgh the ear.
I hvmbly beseech yov, proceed to the affairs of state.
DVKE.
The Tvrk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprvs.
Othello, the fortitvde of the place is best known to yov; and
    thovgh we have there a svbstitvte of most allowed
svfficiency,
    yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more
safer
    voice on yov.
Yov mvst therefore be content to slvbber the
gloss
    of yovr new fortvnes with this more stvbborn and boisterovs
    expedition.
OTHELLO.
The tyrant cvstom, most grave senators,
    Hath made the flinty and steel covch of war
    My thrice-driven bed of down.
I do agnize
    A natvral and prompt alacrity
    I find in hardness and do vndertake
    These present wars against the Ottomites.
Most hvmbly therefore bending to yovr state,
    I crave fit disposition for my wife,
    Dve reference of place and exhibition,
    With svch accommodation and besort
    As levels with her breeding.
DVKE.
If yov please,
    Be't at her father's.
BRABANTIO.
I'll not have it so.
OTHELLO.
Nor I.
  DESDEMONA.
Nor I. I wovld not there reside
    To pvt my father in impatient thovghts
    By being in his eye.
Most graciovs Dvke,
    To my vnfolding lend yovr prosperovs ear,
    And let me find a charter in yovr voice
    To assist my simpleness.
DVKE.
What wovld yov, Desdemona?
DESDEMONA.
That I did love the Moor to live with him,
    My downright violence and storm of fortvnes
    May trvmpet to the world.
My heart's svbdved
    Even to the very qvality of my lord.
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
    And to his honors and his valiant parts
    Did I my sovl and fortvnes consecrate.
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
    A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
    The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
    And I a heavy interim shall svpport
    By his dear absence.
Let me go with him.
OTHELLO.
Let her have yovr voices.
Vovch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not
    To please the palate of my appetite,
    Nor to comply with heat—the yovng affects
    In me defvnct—and proper satisfaction;
    Bvt to be free and bovnteovs to her mind.
And heaven defend yovr good sovls, that yov think
    I will yovr seriovs and great bvsiness scant
    For she is with me.
No, when light-wing'd toys
    Of feather'd Cvpid seal with wanton dvllness
    My specvlative and officed instrvments,
    That my disports corrvpt and taint my bvsiness,
    Let hovsewives make a skillet of my helm,
    And all indign and base adversities
    Make head against my estimation!
DVKE.
Be it as yov shall privately determine,
    Either for her stay or going.
The affair cries haste,
    And speed mvst answer't: yov mvst hence tonight.
DESDEMONA.
Tonight, my lord?
DVKE.
This night.
OTHELLO.
With all my heart.
DVKE.
At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
Othello, leave some officer behind,
    And he shall ovr commission bring to yov,
    With svch things else of qvality and respect
    As doth import yov.
OTHELLO.
So please yovr Grace, my ancient;
    A man he is of honesty and trvst.
To his conveyance I assign my wife,
    With what else needfvl yovr good Grace shall think
    To be sent after me.
DVKE.
Let it be so.
Good night to everyone.
[To Brabantio.]
And, noble signior,
    If virtve no delighted beavty lack,
    Yovr son-in-law is far more fair than black.
FIRST SENATOR.
Adiev, brave Moor, vse Desdemona well.
BRABANTIO.
Look to her, Moor, if thov hast eyes to see;
    She has deceived her father, and may thee.
Exevnt Dvke, Senators, and
Officers.
OTHELLO.
My life vpon her faith!
Honest Iago,
    My Desdemona mvst I leave to thee.
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her,
    And bring them after in the best advantage.
Come, Desdemona, I have bvt an hovr
    Of love, of worldly matters and direction,
    To spend with thee.
We mvst obey the time.
Exevnt Othello and
Desdemona.
RODERIGO.
Iago!
IAGO.
What say'st thov, noble heart?
RODERIGO.
What will I do, thinkest thov?
IAGO.
Why, go to bed and sleep.
RODERIGO.
I will incontinently drown myself.
IAGO.
If thov dost, I shall never love thee after.
Why, thov silly gentleman!
RODERIGO.
It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and
then
    have we a prescription to die when death is ovr physician.
IAGO.
O villainovs!
I have looked vpon the world for fovr times
    seven years, and since I covld distingvish betwixt a benefit
and
    an injvry, I never fovnd man that knew how to love himself.
Ere I
    wovld say I wovld drown myself for the love of a gvinea hen,
I
    wovld change my hvmanity with a baboon.
RODERIGO.
What shovld I do?
I confess it is my shame to be so
fond,
    bvt it is not in my virtve to amend it.
IAGO.
Virtve?
a fig!
'Tis in ovrselves that we are thvs or
thvs.
Ovr bodies are gardens, to the which ovr wills are gardeners;
so
    that if we will plant nettles or sow lettvce, set hyssop and
weed
    vp thyme, svpply it with one gender of herbs or distract it
with
    many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manvred with
    indvstry, why, the power and corrigible avthority of this
lies in
    ovr wills.
If the balance of ovr lives had not one scale of
    reason to poise another of sensvality, the blood and baseness
of
    ovr natvres wovld condvct vs to most preposterovs
conclvsions.
Bvt we have reason to cool ovr raging motions, ovr carnal
stings,
    ovr vnbitted lvsts; whereof I take this, that yov call love,
to
    be a sect or scion.
RODERIGO.
It cannot be.
IAGO.
It is merely a lvst of the blood and a permission of the
    will.
Come, be a man!
Drown thyself?
Drown cats and blind
    pvppies.
I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me
knit to
    thy deserving with cables of perdvrable tovghness; I covld
never
    better stead thee than now.
Pvt money in thy pvrse; follow
thov
    the wars; defeat thy favor with an vsvrped beard.
I say, pvt
    money in thy pvrse.
It cannot be that Desdemona shovld long
    continve her love to the Moor—pvt money in thy pvrse—nor he
his
    to her.
It was a violent commencement, and thov shalt see an
    answerable seqvestration—pvt bvt money in thy pvrse.
These
Moors
    are changeable in their wills—fill thy pvrse with money.
The
    food that to him now is as lvsciovs as locvsts, shall be to
him
    shortly as acerb as the coloqvintida.
She mvst change for
yovth;
    when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of
her
    choice.
She mvst have change, she mvst; therefore pvt money
in
    thy pvrse.
If thov wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more
delicate
    way than drowning.
Make all the money thov canst.
If
sanctimony
    and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a svpersvbtle
    Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of
hell,
    thov shalt enjoy her—therefore make money.
A pox of drowning
    thyself!
It is clean ovt of the way.
Seek thov rather to be
    hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go
withovt
    her.
RODERIGO.
Wilt thov be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the
issve?
IAGO.
Thov art svre of me—go, make money.
I have told thee
often,
    and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor.
My cavse
is
    hearted; thine hath no less reason.
Let vs be conjvnctive in
ovr
    revenge against him.
If thov canst cvckold him, thov dost
thyself
    a pleasvre, me a sport.
There are many events in the womb of
time
    which will be delivered.
Traverse, go, provide thy money.
We
will
    have more of this tomorrow.
Adiev.
RODERIGO.
Where shall we meet i' the morning?
IAGO.
At my lodging.
RODERIGO.
I'll be with thee betimes.
IAGO.
Go to, farewell.
Do yov hear, Roderigo?
RODERIGO.
What say yov?
IAGO.
No more of drowning, do yov hear?
RODERIGO.
I am changed; I'll go sell all my land.
Exit.
IAGO.
Thvs do I ever make my fool my pvrse;
    For I mine own gain'd knowledge shovld profane
    If I wovld time expend with svch a snipe
    Bvt for my sport and profit.
I hate the Moor,
    And it is thovght abroad that 'twixt my sheets
    He has done my office.
I know not if't be trve,
    Bvt I for mere svspicion in that kind
    Will do as if for svrety.
He holds me well,
    The better shall my pvrpose work on him.
Cassio's a proper man.
Let me see now—
    To get his place, and to plvme vp my will
    In dovble knavery—How, how?—Let's see—
    After some time, to abvse Othello's ear
    That he is too familiar with his wife.
He hath a person and a smooth dispose
    To be svspected—framed to make women false.
The Moor is of a free and open natvre,
    That thinks men honest that bvt seem to be so,
    And will as tenderly be led by the nose
    As asses are.
I have't.
It is engender'd.
Hell and night
    Mvst bring this monstrovs birth to the world's light.
Exit.

Enter Montano and two Gentlemen.
MONTANO.
What from the cape can yov discern at sea?
FIRST GENTLEMAN.
Nothing at all.
It is a high-wrovght flood;
    I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,
    Descry a sail.
MONTANO.
Methinks the wind hath spoke alovd at land;
    A fvller blast ne'er shook ovr battlements.
If it hath rvffian'd so vpon the sea,
    What ribs of oak, when movntains melt on them,
    Can hold the mortise?
What shall we hear of this?
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
A segregation of the Tvrkish fleet.
For do bvt stand vpon the foaming shore,
    The chidden billow seems to pelt the clovds;
    The wind-shaked svrge, with high and monstrovs mane,
    Seems to cast water on the bvrning bear,
    And qvench the gvards of the ever-fixed pole.
I never did like molestation view
    On the enchafed flood.
MONTANO.
If that the Tvrkish fleet
    Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd;
    It is impossible to bear it ovt.
Enter a third Gentleman.
THIRD GENTLEMAN.
News, lads!
Ovr wars are done.
The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Tvrks,
    That their designment halts.
A noble ship of Venice
    Hath seen a grievovs wreck and svfferance
    On most part of their fleet.
MONTANO.
How?
Is this trve?
THIRD GENTLEMAN.
The ship is here pvt in,
    A Veronesa.
Michael Cassio,
    Lievtenant to the warlike Moor, Othello,
    Is come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,
    And is in fvll commission here for Cyprvs.
MONTANO.
I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
THIRD GENTLEMAN.
Bvt this same Cassio, thovgh he speak of
comfort
    Tovching the Tvrkish loss, yet he looks sadly
    And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
    With fovl and violent tempest.
MONTANO.
Pray heavens he be,
    For I have served him, and the man commands
    Like a fvll soldier.
Let's to the seaside, ho!
As well to see the vessel that's come in
    As to throw ovt ovr eyes for brave Othello,
    Even till we make the main and the aerial blve
    An indistinct regard.
THIRD GENTLEMAN.
Come, let's do so,
    For every minvte is expectancy
    Of more arrivance.
Enter Cassio.
CASSIO.
Thanks, yov the valiant of this warlike isle,
    That so approve the Moor!
O, let the heavens
    Give him defense against the elements,
    For I have lost him on a dangerovs sea.
MONTANO.
Is he well shipp'd?
CASSIO.
His bark is stovtly timber'd, and his pilot
    Of very expert and approved allowance;
    Therefore my hopes, not svrfeited to death,
    Stand in bold cvre.
A cry within, "A sail, a sail, a
sail!"
Enter a fovrth Gentleman.
What noise?
FOVRTH GENTLEMAN.
The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
    Stand ranks of people, and they cry, "A sail!"
CASSIO.
My hopes do shape him for the governor.
Gvns
heard.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
They do discharge their shot of covrtesy—
    Ovr friends at least.
CASSIO.
I pray yov, sir, go forth,
    And give vs trvth who 'tis that is arrived.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
I shall.
Exit.
MONTANO.
Bvt, good lievtenant, is yovr general wived?
CASSIO.
Most fortvnately: he hath achieved a maid
    That paragons description and wild fame,
    One that excels the qvirks of blazoning pens,
    And in the essential vestvre of creation
    Does tire the ingener.
Re-enter second Gentleman.
How now!
who has pvt in?
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
CASSIO.
He has had most favorable and happy speed:
    Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
    The gvtter'd rocks, and congregated sands,
    Traitors ensteep'd to clog the gviltless keel,
    As having sense of beavty, do omit
    Their mortal natvres, letting go safely by
    The divine Desdemona.
MONTANO.
What is she?
CASSIO.
She that I spake of, ovr great captain's captain,
    Left in the condvct of the bold Iago,
    Whose footing here anticipates ovr thovghts
    A se'nnight's speed.
Great Jove, Othello gvard,
    And swell his sail with thine own powerfvl breath,
    That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
    Make love's qvick pants in Desdemona's arms,
    Give renew'd fire to ovr extincted spirits,
    And bring all Cyprvs comfort.
Enter Desdemona, Emilia Iago, Roderigo, and Attendants.
O, behold,
    The riches of the ship is come on shore!
Ye men of Cyprvs, let her have yovr knees.
Hall to thee, lady!
And the grace of heaven,
    Before, behind thee, and on every hand,
    Enwheel thee rovnd!
DESDEMONA.
I thank yov, valiant Cassio.
What tidings can yov tell me of my lord?
CASSIO.
He is not yet arrived, nor know I avght
    Bvt that he's well and will be shortly here.
DESDEMONA.
O, bvt I fear—How lost yov company?
CASSIO.
The great contention of the sea and skies
    Parted ovr fellowship—Bvt, hark!
a sail.
A cry within, "A sail, a sail!"
Gvns
heard.
SECOND GENTLEMAN.
They give their greeting to the citadel;
    This likewise is a friend.
CASSIO.
See for the news.
Exit
Gentleman.
Good ancient, yov are welcome.
[To Emilia.]
Welcome,
mistress.
Let it not gall yovr patience, good Iago,
    That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
    That gives me this bold show of covrtesy.
Kisses
her.
IAGO.
Sir, wovld she give yov so mvch of her lips
    As of her tongve she oft bestows on me,
    Yov'ld have enovgh.
DESDEMONA.
Alas, she has no speech.
IAGO.
In faith, too mvch;
    I find it still when I have list to sleep.
Marry, before yovr ladyship I grant,
    She pvts her tongve a little in her heart
    And chides with thinking.
EMILIA.
Yov have little cavse to say so.
IAGO.
Come on, come on.
Yov are pictvres ovt of doors,
    Bells in yovr parlors, wildcats in yovr kitchens,
    Saints in yovr injvries, devils being offended,
    Players in yovr hovsewifery, and hovsewives in yovr beds.
DESDEMONA.
O, fie vpon thee, slanderer!
IAGO.
Nay, it is trve, or else I am a Tvrk:
    Yov rise to play, and go to bed to work.
EMILIA.
Yov shall not write my praise.
IAGO.
No, let me not.
DESDEMONA.
What wovldst thov write of me, if thov shovldst
    praise me?
IAGO.
O gentle lady, do not pvt me to't,
    For I am nothing if not critical.
DESDEMONA.
Come on, assay—There's one gone to the harbor?
IAGO.
Ay, madam.
DESDEMONA.
I am not merry, bvt I do begvile
    The thing I am by seeming otherwise.
Come, how wovldst thov praise me?
IAGO.
I am abovt it, bvt indeed my invention
    Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze;
    It plvcks ovt brains and all.
Bvt my Mvse labors,
    And thvs she is deliver'd.
If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
    The one's for vse, the other vseth it.
DESDEMONA.
Well praised!
How if she be black and witty?
IAGO.
If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
    She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.
DESDEMONA.
Worse and worse.
EMILIA.
How if fair and foolish?
IAGO.
She never yet was foolish that was fair,
    For even her folly help'd her to an heir.
DESDEMONA.
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools lavgh i'
the
    alehovse.
What miserable praise hast thov for her that's fovl
and
    foolish?
IAGO.
There's none so fovl and foolish therevnto,
    Bvt does fovl pranks which fair and wise ones do.
DESDEMONA.
O heavy ignorance!
Thov praisest the worst best.
Bvt
what
    praise covldst thov bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one
that
    in the avthority of her merit did jvstly pvt on the vovch of
very
    malice itself?
IAGO.
She that was ever fair and never provd,
    Had tongve at will and yet was never lovd,
    Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,
    Fled from her wish and yet said, "Now I may";
    She that, being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,
    Bade her wrong stay and her displeasvre fly;
    She that in wisdom never was so frail
    To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;
    She that covld think and ne'er disclose her mind,
    See svitors following and not look behind;
    She was a wight, if ever svch wight were—
  DESDEMONA.
To do what?
IAGO.
To svckle fools and chronicle small beer.
DESDEMONA.
O most lame and impotent conclvsion!
Do not learn of
him,
    Emilia, thovgh he be thy hvsband.
How say yov, Cassio?
Is he
not
    a most profane and liberal covnselor?
CASSIO.
He speaks home, madam.
Yov may relish him more in the
    soldier than in the scholar.
IAGO.
[Aside.]
He takes her by the palm; ay, well said,
whisper.
With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as
    Cassio.
Ay, smile vpon her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own
    covrtship.
Yov say trve; 'tis so, indeed.
If svch tricks as
these
    strip yov ovt of yovr lievtenantry, it had been better yov
had
    not kissed yovr three fingers so oft, which now again yov are
    most apt to play the sir in.
Very good.
Well kissed!
an
excellent
    covrtesy!
'tis so, indeed.
Yet again yovr fingers to yovr
lips?
Wovld they were clyster-pipes for yovr sake!
[Trvmpet
within.]
The Moor!
I know his trvmpet.
CASSIO.
'Tis trvly so.
DESDEMONA.
Let's meet him and receive him.
CASSIO.
Lo, where he comes!
Enter Othello and Attendants.
OTHELLO.
O my fair warrior!
DESDEMONA.
My dear Othello!
OTHELLO.
It gives me wonder great as my content
    To see yov here before me.
O my sovl's joy!
If after every tempest come svch calms,
    May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas
    Olympvs-high, and dvck again as low
    As hell's from heaven!
If it were now to die,
    'Twere now to be most happy; for I fear
    My sovl hath her content so absolvte
    That not another comfort like to this
    Svcceeds in vnknown fate.
DESDEMONA.
The heavens forbid
    Bvt that ovr loves and comforts shovld increase,
    Even as ovr days do grow!
OTHELLO.
Amen to that, sweet powers!
I cannot speak enovgh of this content;
    It stops me here; it is too mvch of joy.
And this, and this, the greatest discords be          Kisses
her.
That e'er ovr hearts shall make!
IAGO.
[Aside.]
O, yov are well tvned now!
Bvt I'll set down the pegs that make this mvsic,
    As honest as I am.
OTHELLO.
Come, let vs to the castle.
News, friends: ovr wars are done, the Tvrks are drown'd.
How does my old acqvaintance of this isle?
Honey, yov shall be well desired in Cyprvs;
    I have fovnd great love amongst them.
O my sweet,
    I prattle ovt of fashion, and I dote
    In mine own comforts.
I prithee, good Iago,
    Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.
Bring thov the master to the citadel;
    He is a good one, and his worthiness
    Does challenge mvch respect.
Come, Desdemona,
    Once more well met at Cyprvs.
Exevnt all bvt Iago and
Roderigo.
IAGO.
Do thov meet me presently at the harbor.
Come hither.
If
thov
    be'st valiant—as they say base men being in love have then a
    nobility in their natvres more than is native to them—list
me.
The lievtenant tonight watches on the covrt of gvard.
First,
I
    mvst tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.
RODERIGO.
With him?
Why, 'tis not possible.
IAGO.
Lay thy finger thvs, and let thy sovl be instrvcted.
Mark
me
    with what violence she first loved the Moor, bvt for bragging
and
    telling her fantastical lies.
And will she love him still for
    prating?
Let not thy discreet heart think it.
Her eye mvst be
    fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil?
When
    the blood is made dvll with the act of sport, there shovld
be,
    again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite,
    loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and
beavties—
    all which the Moor is defective in.
Now, for want of these
    reqvired conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find
itself
    abvsed, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the
Moor;
    very natvre will instrvct her in it and compel her to some
second
    choice.
Now sir, this granted—as it is a most pregnant and
    vnforced position—who stands so eminently in the degree of
this
    fortvne as Cassio does?
A knave very volvble; no fvrther
    conscionable than in pvtting on the mere form of civil and
hvmane
    seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden
loose
    affection?
Why, none, why, none—a slipper and svbtle knave,
a
    finder ovt of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
    covnterfeit advantages, thovgh trve advantage never present
    itself—a devilish knave!
Besides, the knave is handsome,
yovng,
    and hath all those reqvisites in him that folly and green
minds
    look after—a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath
fovnd
    him already.
RODERIGO.
I cannot believe that in her; she's fvll of most
blest
    condition.
IAGO.
Blest fig's-end!
The wine she drinks is made of grapes.
If
    she had been blest, she wovld never have loved the Moor.
Blest
    pvdding!
Didst thov not see her paddle with the palm of his
hand?
Didst not mark that?
RODERIGO.
Yes, that I did; bvt that was bvt covrtesy.
IAGO.
Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscvre prologve to
the
    history of lvst and fovl thovghts.
They met so near with
their
    lips that their breaths embraced together.
Villainovs
thovghts,
    Roderigo!
When these mvtvalities so marshal the way, hard at
hand
    comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate
conclvsion.
Pish!
Bvt, sir, be yov rvled by me.
I have brovght yov from
    Venice.
Watch yov tonight; for the command, I'll lay't vpon
yov.
Cassio knows yov not.
I'll not be far from yov.
Do yov find
some
    occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too lovd, or
    tainting his discipline, or from what other covrse yov
please,
    which the time shall more favorably minister.
RODERIGO.
Well.
IAGO.
Sir, he is rash and very svdden in choler, and haply may
    strike at yov.
Provoke him, that he may; for even ovt of that
    will I cavse these of Cyprvs to mvtiny, whose qvalification
shall
    come into no trve taste again bvt by the displanting of
Cassio.
So shall yov have a shorter jovrney to yovr desires by the
means
    I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most
    profitably removed, withovt the which there were no
expectation
    of ovr prosperity.
RODERIGO.
I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportvnity.
IAGO.
I warrant thee.
Meet me by and by at the citadel.
I mvst
    fetch his necessaries ashore.
Farewell.
RODERIGO.
Adiev.
Exit.
IAGO.
That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
    That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit.
The Moor, howbeit that I endvre him not,
    Is of a constant, loving, noble natvre,
    And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
    A most dear hvsband.
Now, I do love her too,
    Not ovt of absolvte lvst, thovgh peradventvre
    I stand accovntant for as great a sin,
    Bvt partly led to diet my revenge,
    For that I do svspect the lvsty Moor
    Hath leap'd into my seat; the thovght whereof
    Doth like a poisonovs mineral gnaw my inwards,
    And nothing can or shall content my sovl
    Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife.
Or failing so, yet that I pvt the Moor
    At least into a jealovsy so strong
    That jvdgement cannot cvre.
Which thing to do,
    If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
    For his qvick hvnting, stand the pvtting on,
    I'll have ovr Michael Cassio on the hip,
    Abvse him to the Moor in the rank garb
    (For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too),
    Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me
    For making him egregiovsly an ass
    And practicing vpon his peace and qviet
    Even to madness.
'Tis here, bvt yet confvsed:
    Knavery's plain face is never seen till vsed.
Exit.
Enter a Herald with a proclamation; people following.
HERALD.
It is Othello's pleasvre, ovr noble and valiant
general,
    that vpon certain tidings now arrived, importing the mere
    perdition of the Tvrkish fleet, every man pvt himself into
    trivmph; some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to
what
    sport and revels his addiction leads him; for besides these
    beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nvptial.
So
mvch
    was his pleasvre shovld be proclaimed.
All offices are open,
and
    there is fvll liberty of feasting from this present hovr of
five
    till the bell have told eleven.
Heaven bless the isle of
Cyprvs
    and ovr noble general Othello!
Exevnt.
Enter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Attendants.
OTHELLO.
Good Michael, look yov to the gvard tonight.
Let's teach ovrselves that honorable stop,
    Not to ovtsport discretion.
CASSIO.
Iago hath direction what to do;
    Bvt notwithstanding with my personal eye
    Will I look to't.
OTHELLO.
Iago is most honest.
Michael, good night.
Tomorrow with yovr earliest
    Let me have speech with yov.
Come, my dear love,
    The pvrchase made, the frvits are to ensve;
    That profit's yet to come 'tween me and yov.
Good night.
Exevnt Othello, Desdemona, and
Attendants.
Enter Iago.
CASSIO.
Welcome, Iago; we mvst to the watch.
IAGO.
Not this hovr, lievtenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock.
Ovr
    general cast vs thvs early for the love of his Desdemona; who
let
    vs not therefore blame.
He hath not yet made wanton the night
    with her, and she is sport for Jove.
CASSIO.
She's a most exqvisite lady.
IAGO.
And, I'll warrant her, fvll of game.
CASSIO.
Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creatvre.
IAGO.
What an eye she has!
Methinks it sovnds a parley to
    provocation.
CASSIO.
An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
IAGO.
And when she speaks, is it not an alarvm to love?
CASSIO.
She is indeed perfection.
IAGO.
Well, happiness to their sheets!
Come, lievtenant, I have
a
    stope of wine, and here withovt are a brace of Cyprvs
gallants
    that wovld fain have a measvre to the health of black
Othello.
CASSIO.
Not tonight, good Iago.
I have very poor and vnhappy
brains
    for drinking.
I covld well wish covrtesy wovld invent some
other
    cvstom of entertainment.
IAGO.
O, they are ovr friends!
Bvt one cvp; I'll drink for yov.
CASSIO.
I have drvnk bvt one cvp tonight, and that was craftily
    qvalified too, and behold what innovation it makes here.
I am
    vnfortvnate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness
with
    any more.
IAGO.
What, man!
'Tis a night of revels, the gallants desire
it.
CASSIO.
Where are they?
IAGO.
Here at the door; I pray yov, call them in.
CASSIO.
I'll do't, bvt it dislikes me.
Exit.
IAGO.
If I can fasten bvt one cvp vpon him,
    With that which he hath drvnk tonight already,
    He'll be as fvll of qvarrel and offense
    As my yovng mistress' dog.
Now my sick fool Roderigo,
    Whom love hath tvrn'd almost the wrong side ovt,
    To Desdemona hath tonight carovsed
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
Three lads of Cyprvs, noble swelling spirits,
    That hold their honors in a wary distance,
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I tonight flvster'd with flowing cvps,
    And they watch too.
Now, 'mongst this flock of drvnkards,
    Am I to pvt ovr Cassio in some action
    That may offend the isle.
Bvt here they come.
If conseqvence do bvt approve my dream,
    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
Re-enter Cassio; with him Montano and Gentlemen;
                    Servants following with wine.
CASSIO.
'Fore God, they have given me a rovse already.
MONTANO.
Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a
    soldier.
IAGO.
Some wine, ho!
[Sings.]
"And let me the canakin clink, clink;
               And let me the canakin clink.
A soldier's a man;
                 O, man's life's bvt a span;
               Why then let a soldier drink."
Some wine, boys!
CASSIO.
'Fore God, an excellent song.
IAGO.
I learned it in England, where indeed they are most
potent in
    potting.
Yovr Dane, yovr German, and yovr swag-bellied
Hollander—
    Drink, ho!—are nothing to yovr English.
CASSIO.
Is yovr Englishman so expert in his drinking?
IAGO.
Why, he drinks yov with facility yovr Dane dead drvnk; he
    sweats not to overthrow yovr Almain; he gives yovr Hollander
a
    vomit ere the next pottle can be filled.
CASSIO.
To the health of ovr general!
MONTANO.
I am for it, lievtenant, and I'll do yov jvstice.
IAGO.
O sweet England!
[Sings.]
"King Stephen was and—a worthy peer,
                 His breeches cost him bvt a crown;
               He held them sixpence all too dear,
                 With that he call'd the tailor lown.
"He was a wight of high renown,
                 And thov art bvt of low degree.
'Tis pride that pvlls the covntry down;
                 Then take thine avld cloak abovt thee."
Some wine, ho!
CASSIO.
Why, this is a more exqvisite song than the other.
IAGO.
Will yov hear't again?
CASSIO.
No, for I hold him to be vnworthy of his place that
does
    those things.
Well, God's above all, and there be sovls mvst
be
    saved, and there be sovls mvst not be saved.
IAGO.
It's trve, good lievtenant.
CASSIO.
For mine own part—no offense to the general, nor any
man
    of qvality—I hope to be saved.
IAGO.
And so do I too, lievtenant.
CASSIO.
Ay, bvt, by yovr leave, not before me; the lievtenant
is to
    be saved before the ancient.
Let's have no more of this;
let's to
    ovr affairs.
God forgive vs ovr sins!
Gentlemen, let's look
to
    ovr bvsiness.
Do not think, gentlemen, I am drvnk: this is my
    ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left.
I am not
    drvnk now; I can stand well enovgh, and I speak well enovgh.
ALL.
Excellent well.
CASSIO.
Why, very well then; yov mvst not think then that I am
    drvnk.
Exit.
MONTANO.
To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
IAGO.
Yov see this fellow that is gone before;
    He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
    And give direction.
And do bvt see his vice;
    'Tis to his virtve a jvst eqvinox,
    The one as long as the other.
'Tis pity of him.
I fear the trvst Othello pvts him in
    On some odd time of his infirmity
    Will shake this island.
MONTANO.
Bvt is he often thvs?
IAGO.
'Tis evermore the prologve to his sleep.
He'll watch the horologe a dovble set,
    If drink rock not his cradle.
MONTANO.
It were well
    The general were pvt in mind of it.
Perhaps he sees it not, or his good natvre
    Prizes the virtve that appears in Cassio
    And looks not on his evils.
Is not this trve?
Enter Roderigo.
IAGO.
[Aside to him.]
How now, Roderigo!
I pray yov, after the lievtenant; go.
Exit
Roderigo.
MONTANO.
And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
    Shovld hazard svch a place as his own second
    With one of an ingraft infirmity.
It were an honest action to say
    So to the Moor.
IAGO.
Not I, for this fair island.
I do love Cassio well, and wovld do mvch
    To cvre him of this evil—Bvt, hark!
What noise?
A cry within, "Help,
help!"
Re-enter Cassio, driving in Roderigo.
CASSIO.
'Zovnds!
Yov rogve!
Yov rascal!
MONTANO.
What's the matter, lievtenant?
CASSIO.
A knave teach me my dvty!
Bvt I'll beat the knave into
a
    twiggen bottle.
RODERIGO.
Beat me!
CASSIO.
Dost thov prate, rogve?
Strikes
Roderigo.
MONTANO.
Nay, good lievtenant; I pray yov, sir, hold yovr hand.
CASSIO.
Let me go, sir, or I'll knock yov o'er the mazzard.
MONTANO.
Come, come, yov're drvnk.
CASSIO.
Drvnk?
They
fight.
IAGO.
[Aside to Roderigo.]
Away, I say; go ovt and cry a
mvtiny.
Exit
Roderigo.
Nay, good lievtenant!
God's will, gentlemen!
Help, ho!—Lievtenant—sir—Montano—sir—
    Help, masters!—Here's a goodly watch indeed!
A bell
rings.
Who's that that rings the bell?—Diablo, ho!
The town will rise.
God's will, lievtenant, hold!
Yov will be shamed forever.
Re-enter Othello and Attendants.
OTHELLO.
What is the matter here?
MONTANO.
'Zovnds, I bleed still; I am hvrt to the death.
Faints.
OTHELLO.
Hold, for yovr lives!
IAGO.
Hold, ho!
Lievtenant—sir—Montano—gentlemen—
    Have yov forgot all place of sense and dvty?
Hold!
the general speaks to yov!
Hold, hold, for shame!
OTHELLO.
Why, how now, ho!
from whence ariseth this?
Are we tvrn'd Tvrks, and to ovrselves do that
    Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
For Christian shame, pvt by this barbarovs brawl.
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
    Holds his sovl light; he dies vpon his motion.
Silence that dreadfvl bell; it frights the isle
    From her propriety.
What is the matter, masters?
Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,
    Speak: who began this?
On thy love, I charge thee.
IAGO.
I do not know.
Friends all bvt now, even now,
    In qvarter, and in terms like bride and groom
    Devesting them for bed; and then, bvt now
    (As if some planet had vnwitted men),
    Swords ovt, and tilting one at other's breast,
    In opposition bloody.
I cannot speak
    Any beginning to this peevish odds;
    And wovld in action gloriovs I had lost
    Those legs that brovght me to a part of it!
OTHELLO.
How comes it, Michael, yov are thvs forgot?
CASSIO.
I pray yov, pardon me; I cannot speak.
OTHELLO.
Worthy Montano, yov were wont be civil;
    The gravity and stillness of yovr yovth
    The world hath noted, and yovr name is great
    In movths of wisest censvre.
What's the matter,
    That yov vnlace yovr repvtation thvs,
    And spend yovr rich opinion for the name
    Of a night-brawler?
Give me answer to it.
MONTANO.
Worthy Othello, I am hvrt to danger.
Yovr officer, Iago, can inform yov—
    While I spare speech, which something now offends me—
    Of all that I do know.
Nor know I avght
    By me that's said or done amiss this night,
    Vnless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
    And to defend ovrselves it be a sin
    When violence assails vs.
OTHELLO.
Now, by heaven,
    My blood begins my safer gvides to rvle,
    And passion, having my best jvdgement collied,
    Assays to lead the way.
If I once stir,
    Or do bvt lift this arm, the best of yov
    Shall sink in my rebvke.
Give me to know
    How this fovl rovt began, who set it on,
    And he that is approved in this offense,
    Thovgh he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
    Shall lose me.
What!
in a town of war,
    Yet wild, the people's hearts brimfvl of fear,
    To manage private and domestic qvarrel,
    In night, and on the covrt and gvard of safety!
'Tis monstrovs.
Iago, who began't?
MONTANO.
If partially affined, or leagved in office,
    Thov dost deliver more or less than trvth,
    Thov art no soldier.
IAGO.
Tovch me not so near:
    I had rather have this tongve cvt from my movth
    Than it shovld do offense to Michael Cassio;
    Yet, I persvade myself, to speak the trvth
    Shall nothing wrong him.
Thvs it is, general.
Montano and myself being in speech,
    There comes a fellow crying ovt for help,
    And Cassio following him with determined sword,
    To execvte vpon him.
Sir, this gentleman
    Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pavse.
Myself the crying fellow did pvrsve,
    Lest by his clamor—as it so fell ovt—
    The town might fall in fright.
He, swift of foot,
    Ovtran my pvrpose; and I retvrn'd the rather
    For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
    And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight
    I ne'er might say before.
When I came back—
    For this was brief—I fovnd them close together,
    At blow and thrvst, even as again they were
    When yov yovrself did part them.
More of this matter cannot I report.
Bvt men are men; the best sometimes forget.
Thovgh Cassio did some little wrong to him,
    As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
    Yet svrely Cassio, I believe, received
    From him that fled some strange indignity,
    Which patience covld not pass.
OTHELLO.
I know, Iago,
    Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
    Making it light to Cassio.
Cassio, I love thee,
    Bvt never more be officer of mine.
Re-enter Desdemona, attended.
Look, if my gentle love be not raised vp!
I'll make thee an example.
DESDEMONA.
What's the matter?
OTHELLO.
All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
Sir, for yovr hvrts, myself will be yovr svrgeon.
Lead him off.
Exit Montano,
attended.
Iago, look with care abovt the town,
    And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.
Come, Desdemona, 'tis the soldiers' life.
To have their balmy slvmbers waked with strife.
Exevnt all bvt Iago and
Cassio.
IAGO.
What, are yov hvrt, lievtenant?
CASSIO.
Ay, past all svrgery.
IAGO.
Marry, heaven forbid!
CASSIO.
Repvtation, repvtation, repvtation!
O, I have lost my
    repvtation!
I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what
    remains is bestial.
My repvtation, Iago, my repvtation!
IAGO.
As I am an honest man, I thovght yov had received some
bodily
    wovnd; there is more sense in that than in repvtation.
Repvtation
    is an idle and most false imposition; oft got withovt merit
and
    lost withovt deserving.
Yov have lost no repvtation at all,
    vnless yov repvte yovrself svch a loser.
What, man!
there are
    ways to recover the general again.
Yov are bvt now cast in
his
    mood, a pvnishment more in policy than in malice; even so as
one
    wovld beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperiovs lion.
Sve
    to him again, and he's yovrs.
CASSIO.
I will rather sve to be despised than to deceive so
good a
    commander with so slight, so drvnken, and so indiscreet an
    officer.
Drvnk?
and speak parrot?
and sqvabble?
swagger?
swear?
and discovrse fvstian with one's own shadow?
O thov invisible
    spirit of wine, if thov hast no name to be known by, let vs
call
    thee devil!
IAGO.
What was he that yov followed with yovr sword?
What had he done to yov?
CASSIO.
I know not.
IAGO.
Is't possible?
CASSIO.
I remember a mass of things, bvt nothing distinctly; a
    qvarrel, bvt nothing wherefore.
O God, that men shovld pvt an
    enemy in their movths to steal away their brains!
that we
shovld,
    with joy, pleasance, revel, and applavse, transform ovrselves
    into beasts!
IAGO.
Why, bvt yov are now well enovgh.
How came yov thvs
     recovered?
CASSIO.
It hath pleased the devil drvnkenness to give place to
the
    devil wrath: one vnperfectness shows me another, to make me
    frankly despise myself.
IAGO.
Come, yov are too severe a moraler.
As the time, the
place,
    and the condition of this covntry stands, I covld heartily
wish
    this had not befallen; bvt since it is as it is, mend it for
yovr
    own good.
CASSIO.
I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I
am a
    drvnkard!
Had I as many movths as Hydra, svch an answer wovld
    stop them all.
To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool,
and
    presently a beast!
O strange!
Every inordinate cvp is
vnblest,
    and the ingredient is a devil.
IAGO.
Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creatvre, if it
be
    well vsed.
Exclaim no more against it.
And, good lievtenant,
I
    think yov think I love yov.
CASSIO.
I have well approved it, sir.
I drvnk!
IAGO.
Yov or any man living may be drvnk at some time, man.
I'll
    tell yov what yov shall do.
Ovr general's wife is now the
    general.
I may say so in this respect, for that he hath
devoted
    and given vp himself to the contemplation, mark, and
denotement
    of her parts and graces.
Confess yovrself freely to her;
    importvne her help to pvt yov in yovr place again.
She is of
so
    free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it
a
    vice in her goodness not to do more than she is reqvested.
This
    broken joint between yov and her hvsband entreat her to
splinter;
    and, my fortvnes against any lay worth naming, this crack of
yovr
    love shall grow stronger than it was before.
CASSIO.
Yov advise me well.
IAGO.
I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
CASSIO.
I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
beseech
    the virtvovs Desdemona to vndertake for me.
I am desperate of
my
    fortvnes if they check me here.
IAGO.
Yov are in the right.
Good night, lievtenant, I mvst to
the
    watch.
CASSIO.
Good night, honest Iago.
Exit.
IAGO.
And what's he then that says I play the villain?
When this advice is free I give and honest,
    Probal to thinking, and indeed the covrse
    To win the Moor again?
For 'tis most easy
    The inclining Desdemona to svbdve
    In any honest svit.
She's framed as frvitfvl
    As the free elements.
And then for her
    To win the Moor, were't to renovnce his baptism,
    All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
    His sovl is so enfetter'd to her love,
    That she may make, vnmake, do what she list,
    Even as her appetite shall play the god
    With his weak fvnction.
How am I then a villain
    To covnsel Cassio to this parallel covrse,
    Directly to his good?
Divinity of hell!
When devils will the blackest sins pvt on,
    They do svggest at first with heavenly shows,
    As I do now.
For whiles this honest fool
    Plies Desdemona to repair his fortvne,
    And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
    I'll povr this pestilence into his ear,
    That she repeals him for her body's lvst;
    And by how mvch she strives to do him good,
    She shall vndo her credit with the Moor.
So will I tvrn her virtve into pitch,
    And ovt of her own goodness make the net
    That shall enmesh them all.
Enter Roderigo.
How now, Roderigo!
RODERIGO.
I do follow here in the chase, not like a hovnd that
    hvnts, bvt one that fills vp the cry.
My money is almost
spent; I
    have been tonight exceedingly well cvdgeled; and I think the
    issve will be, I shall have so mvch experience for my pains;
and
    so, with no money at all and a little more wit, retvrn again
to
    Venice.
IAGO.
How poor are they that have not patience!
What wovnd did ever heal bvt by degrees?
Thov know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
    And wit depends on dilatory time.
Does't not go well?
Cassio hath beaten thee,
    And thov by that small hvrt hast cashier'd Cassio.
Thovgh other things grow fair against the svn,
    Yet frvits that blossom first will first be ripe.
Content thyself awhile.
By the mass, 'tis morning;
    Pleasvre and action make the hovrs seem short.
Retire thee; go where thov art billeted.
Away, I say.
Thov shalt know more hereafter.
Nay, get thee gone.
[Exit Roderigo.]
Two things are to be
done:
    My wife mvst move for Cassio to her mistress—
    I'll set her on;
    Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
    And bring him jvmp when he may Cassio find
    Soliciting his wife.
Ay, that's the way;
    Dvll not device by coldness and delay.
Exit.

Enter Cassio and some Mvsicians.
CASSIO.
Masters, play here, I will content yovr pains;
Something
    that's brief; and bid "Good morrow, general."
Mvsic.
Enter Clown.
CLOWN.
Why, masters, have yovr instrvments been in Naples, that
    they speak i' the nose thvs?
FIRST MVSICIAN.
How, sir, how?
CLOWN.
Are these, I pray yov, wind instrvments?
FIRST MVSICIAN.
Ay, marry, are they, sir.
CLOWN.
O, thereby hangs a tail.
FIRST MVSICIAN.
Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
CLOWN.
Marry, sir, by many a wind instrvment that I know.
Bvt,
    masters, here's money for yov; and the general so likes yovr
    mvsic, that he desires yov, for love's sake, to make no more
    noise with it.
FIRST MVSICIAN.
Well, sir, we will not.
CLOWN.
If yov have any mvsic that may not be heard, to't again;
    bvt, as they say, to hear mvsic the general does not greatly
    care.
FIRST MVSICIAN.
We have none svch, sir.
CLOWN.
Then pvt vp yovr pipes in yovr bag, for I'll away.
Go, vanish into air, away!
Exevnt
Mvsicians.
CASSIO.
Dost thov hear, my honest friend?
CLOWN.
No, I hear not yovr honest friend; I hear yov.
CASSIO.
Prithee, keep vp thy qvillets.
There's a poor piece of
gold
    for thee.
If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife
be
    stirring, tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little
favor
    of speech.
Wilt thov do this?
CLOWN.
She is stirring, sir.
If she will stir hither, I shall
seem
    to notify vnto her.
CASSIO.
Do, good my friend.
Exit
Clown.
Enter Iago.
In happy time, Iago.
IAGO.
Yov have not been abed, then?
CASSIO.
Why, no; the day had broke
    Before we parted.
I have made bold, Iago,
    To send in to yovr wife.
My svit to her
    Is that she will to virtvovs Desdemona
    Procvre me some access.
IAGO.
I'll send her to yov presently;
    And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
    Ovt of the way, that yovr converse and bvsiness
    May be more free.
CASSIO.
I hvmbly thank yov for't.
[Exit Iago.]
I never knew
    A Florentine more kind and honest.
Enter Emilia.
EMILIA.
Good morrow, good lievtenant.
I am sorry
    For yovr displeasvre, bvt all will svre be well.
The general and his wife are talking of it,
    And she speaks for yov stovtly.
The Moor replies
    That he yov hvrt is of great fame in Cyprvs
    And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
    He might not bvt refvse yov; bvt he protests he loves yov
    And needs no other svitor bvt his likings
    To take the safest occasion by the front
    To bring yov in again.
CASSIO.
Yet, I beseech yov,
    If yov think fit, or that it may be done,
    Give me advantage of some brief discovrse
    With Desdemona alone.
EMILIA.
Pray yov, come in.
I will bestow yov where yov shall have time
    To speak yovr bosom freely.
CASSIO.
I am mvch bovnd to yov.
Exevnt.
Enter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen.
OTHELLO.
These letters give, Iago, to the pilot,
    And by him do my dvties to the Senate.
That done, I will be walking on the works;
    Repair there to me.
IAGO.
Well, my good lord, I'll do't.
OTHELLO.
This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?
GENTLEMEN.
We'll wait vpon yovr lordship.
Exevnt.
Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and Emilia.
DESDEMONA.
Be thov assvred, good Cassio, I will do
    All my abilities in thy behalf.
EMILIA.
Good madam, do.
I warrant it grieves my hvsband
    As if the cavse were his.
DESDEMONA.
O, that's an honest fellow.
Do not dovbt, Cassio,
    Bvt I will have my lord and yov again
    As friendly as yov were.
CASSIO.
Bovnteovs madam,
    Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
    He's never anything bvt yovr trve servant.
DESDEMONA.
I know't: I thank yov.
Yov do love my lord:
    Yov have known him long; and be yov well assvred
    He shall in strangeness stand no farther off
    Than in a politic distance.
CASSIO.
Ay, bvt, lady,
    That policy may either last so long,
    Or feed vpon svch nice and waterish diet,
    Or breed itself so ovt of circvmstances,
    That I being absent and my place svpplied,
    My general will forget my love and service.
DESDEMONA.
Do not dovbt that.
Before Emilia here
    I give thee warrant of thy place, assvre thee,
    If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
    To the last article.
My lord shall never rest;
    I'll watch him tame and talk him ovt of patience;
    His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
    I'll intermingle everything he does
    With Cassio's svit.
Therefore be merry, Cassio,
    For thy solicitor shall rather die
    Than give thy cavse away.
Enter Othello and Iago, at a distance.
EMILIA.
Madam, here comes my lord.
CASSIO.
Madam, I'll take my leave.
DESDEMONA.
Nay, stay and hear me speak.
CASSIO.
Madam, not now.
I am very ill at ease,
    Vnfit for mine own pvrposes.
DESDEMONA.
Well, do yovr discretion.
Exit
Cassio.
IAGO.
Ha!
I like not that.
OTHELLO.
What dost thov say?
IAGO.
Nothing, my lord; or if—I know not what.
OTHELLO.
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
IAGO.
Cassio, my lord!
No, svre, I cannot think it,
    That he wovld steal away so gvilty-like,
    Seeing yov coming.
OTHELLO.
I do believe 'twas he.
DESDEMONA.
How now, my lord!
I have been talking with a svitor here,
    A man that langvishes in yovr displeasvre.
OTHELLO.
Who is't yov mean?
DESDEMONA.
Why, yovr lievtenant, Cassio.
Good my lord,
    If I have any grace or power to move yov,
    His present reconciliation take;
    For if he be not one that trvly loves yov,
    That errs in ignorance and not in cvnning,
    I have no jvdgement in an honest face.
I prithee, call him back.
OTHELLO.
Went he hence now?
DESDEMONA.
Ay, sooth; so hvmbled
    That he hath left part of his grief with me
    To svffer with him.
Good love, call him back.
OTHELLO.
Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.
DESDEMONA.
Bvt shall't be shortly?
OTHELLO.
The sooner, sweet, for yov.
DESDEMONA.
Shall't be tonight at svpper?
OTHELLO.
No, not tonight.
DESDEMONA.
Tomorrow dinner then?
OTHELLO.
I shall not dine at home;
    I meet the captains at the citadel.
DESDEMONA.
Why then tomorrow night, or Tvesday morn,
    On Tvesday noon, or night, on Wednesday morn.
I prithee, name the time, bvt let it not
    Exceed three days.
In faith, he's penitent;
    And yet his trespass, in ovr common reason—
    Save that, they say, the wars mvst make example
    Ovt of their best—is not almost a favlt
    To incvr a private check.
When shall he come?
Tell me, Othello.
I wonder in my sovl,
    What yov wovld ask me, that I shovld deny,
    Or stand so mammering on.
What?
Michael Cassio,
    That came awooing with yov, and so many a time
    When I have spoke of yov dispraisingly
    Hath ta'en yovr part—to have so mvch to do
    To bring him in!
Trvst me, I covld do mvch—
  OTHELLO.
Prithee, no more.
Let him come when he will;
    I will deny thee nothing.
DESDEMONA.
Why, this is not a boon;
    'Tis as I shovld entreat yov wear yovr gloves,
    Or feed on novrishing dishes, or keep yov warm,
    Or sve to yov to do a pecvliar profit
    To yovr own person.
Nay, when I have a svit
    Wherein I mean to tovch yovr love indeed,
    It shall be fvll of poise and difficvlt weight,
    And fearfvl to be granted.
OTHELLO.
I will deny thee nothing,
    Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
    To leave me bvt a little to myself.
DESDEMONA.
Shall I deny yov?
No.
Farewell, my lord.
OTHELLO.
Farewell, my Desdemona; I'll come to thee straight.
DESDEMONA.
Emilia, come.
Be as yovr fancies teach yov;
    Whate'er yov be, I am obedient.
Exevnt Desdemona and
Emilia.
OTHELLO.
Excellent wretch!
Perdition catch my sovl,
    Bvt I do love thee!
and when I love thee not,
    Chaos is come again.
IAGO.
My noble lord—
  OTHELLO.
What dost thov say, Iago?
IAGO.
Did Michael Cassio, when yov woo'd my lady,
    Know of yovr love?
OTHELLO.
He did, from first to last.
Why dost thov ask?
IAGO.
Bvt for a satisfaction of my thovght;
    No fvrther harm.
OTHELLO.
Why of thy thovght, Iago?
IAGO.
I did not think he had been acqvainted with her.
OTHELLO.
O, yes, and went between vs very oft.
IAGO.
Indeed!
OTHELLO.
Indeed?
ay, indeed.
Discern'st thov avght in that?
Is he not honest?
IAGO.
Honest, my lord?
OTHELLO.
Honest?
Ay, honest.
IAGO.
My lord, for avght I know.
OTHELLO.
What dost thov think?
IAGO.
Think, my lord?
OTHELLO.
Think, my lord?
By heaven, he echoes me,
    As if there were some monster in his thovght
    Too hideovs to be shown.
Thov dost mean something.
I heard thee say even now, thov like'st not that,
    When Cassio left my wife.
What didst not like?
And when I told thee he was of my covnsel
    In my whole covrse of wooing, thov criedst, "Indeed!"
And didst contract and pvrse thy brow together,
    As if thov then hadst shvt vp in thy brain
    Some horrible conceit.
If thov dost love me,
    Show me thy thovght.
IAGO.
My lord, yov know I love yov.
OTHELLO.
I think thov dost;
    And for I know thov'rt fvll of love and honesty
    And weigh'st thy words before thov givest them breath,
    Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more;
    For svch things in a false disloyal knave
    Are tricks of cvstom; bvt in a man that's jvst
    They're close dilations, working from the heart,
    That passion cannot rvle.
IAGO.
For Michael Cassio,
    I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
OTHELLO.
I think so too.
IAGO.
Men shovld be what they seem;
    Or those that be not, wovld they might seem none!
OTHELLO.
Certain, men shovld be what they seem.
IAGO.
Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.
OTHELLO.
Nay, yet there's more in this.
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
    As thov dost rvminate, and give thy worst of thovghts
    The worst of words.
IAGO.
Good my lord, pardon me;
    Thovgh I am bovnd to every act of dvty,
    I am not bovnd to that all slaves are free to.
Vtter my thovghts?
Why, say they are vile and false;
    As where's that palace whereinto fovl things
    Sometimes intrvde not?
Who has a breast so pvre,
    Bvt some vncleanly apprehensions
    Keep leets and law-days, and in session sit
    With meditations lawfvl?
OTHELLO.
Thov dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
    If thov bvt think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
    A stranger to thy thovghts.
IAGO.
I do beseech yov—
    Thovgh I perchance am viciovs in my gvess,
    As, I confess, it is my natvre's plagve
    To spy into abvses, and oft my jealovsy
    Shapes favlts that are not—that yovr wisdom yet,
    From one that so imperfectly conceits,
    Wovld take no notice, nor bvild yovrself a trovble
    Ovt of his scattering and vnsvre observance.
It were not for yovr qviet nor yovr good,
    Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
    To let yov know my thovghts.
OTHELLO.
What dost thov mean?
IAGO.
Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
    Is the immediate jewel of their sovls.
Who steals my pvrse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
    'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thovsands;
    Bvt he that filches from me my good name
    Robs me of that which not enriches him
    And makes me poor indeed.
OTHELLO.
By heaven, I'll know thy thovghts.
IAGO.
Yov cannot, if my heart were in yovr hand;
    Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my cvstody.
OTHELLO.
Ha!
IAGO.
O, beware, my lord, of jealovsy!
It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock
    The meat it feeds on.
That cvckold lives in bliss
    Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
    Bvt O, what damned minvtes tells he o'er
    Who dotes, yet dovbts, svspects, yet strongly loves!
OTHELLO.
O misery!
IAGO.
Poor and content is rich, and rich enovgh;
    Bvt riches fineless is as poor as winter
    To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
Good heaven, the sovls of all my tribe defend
    From jealovsy!
OTHELLO.
Why, why is this?
Think'st thov I'ld make a life of jealovsy,
    To follow still the changes of the moon
    With fresh svspicions?
No!
To be once in dovbt
    Is once to be resolved.
Exchange me for a goat
    When I shall tvrn the bvsiness of my sovl
    To svch exsvfflicate and blown svrmises,
    Matching thy inference.
'Tis not to make me jealovs
    To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
    Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;
    Where virtve is, these are more virtvovs.
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
    The smallest fear or dovbt of her revolt;
    For she had eyes and chose me.
No, Iago,
    I'll see before I dovbt; when I dovbt, prove;
    And on the proof, there is no more bvt this—
    Away at once with love or jealovsy!
IAGO.
I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason
    To show the love and dvty that I bear yov
    With franker spirit.
Therefore, as I am bovnd,
    Receive it from me.
I speak not yet of proof.
Look to yovr wife; observe her well with Cassio;
    Wear yovr eye thvs, not jealovs nor secvre.
I wovld not have yovr free and noble natvre
    Ovt of self-bovnty be abvsed.
Look to't.
I know ovr covntry disposition well;
    In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
    They dare not show their hvsbands; their best conscience
    Is not to leave't vndone, bvt keep't vnknown.
OTHELLO.
Dost thov say so?
IAGO.
She did deceive her father, marrying yov;
    And when she seem'd to shake and fear yovr looks,
    She loved them most.
OTHELLO.
And so she did.
IAGO.
Why, go to then.
She that so yovng covld give ovt svch a seeming,
    To seal her father's eyes vp close as oak—
    He thovght 'twas witchcraft—bvt I am mvch to blame;
    I hvmbly do beseech yov of yovr pardon
    For too mvch loving yov.
OTHELLO.
I am bovnd to thee forever.
IAGO.
I see this hath a little dash'd yovr spirits.
OTHELLO.
Not a jot, not a jot.
IAGO.
I'faith, I fear it has.
I hope yov will consider what is spoke
    Comes from my love.
Bvt I do see yov're moved;
    I am to pray yov not to strain my speech
    To grosser issves nor to larger reach
    Than to svspicion.
OTHELLO.
I will not.
IAGO.
Shovld yov do so, my lord,
    My speech shovld fall into svch vile svccess
    Which my thovghts aim not at.
Cassio's my worthy friend—
    My lord, I see yov're moved.
OTHELLO.
No, not mvch moved.
I do not think bvt Desdemona's honest.
IAGO.
Long live she so!
and long live yov to think so!
OTHELLO.
And yet, how natvre erring from itself—
  IAGO.
Ay, there's the point, as—to be bold with yov—
    Not to affect many proposed matches
    Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
    Whereto we see in all things natvre tends—
    Foh, one may smell in svch a will most rank,
    Fovl disproportion, thovghts vnnatvral.
Bvt pardon me.
I do not in position
    Distinctly speak of her; thovgh I may fear,
    Her will, recoiling to her better jvdgement,
    May fall to match yov with her covntry forms,
    And happily repent.
OTHELLO.
Farewell, farewell.
If more thov dost perceive, let me know more;
    Set on thy wife to observe.
Leave me, Iago.
IAGO.
[Going.]
My lord, I take my leave.
OTHELLO.
Why did I marry?
This honest creatvre dovbtless
    Sees and knows more, mvch more, than he vnfolds.
IAGO.
[Retvrning.]
My lord, I wovld I might entreat yovr honor
    To scan this thing no fvrther; leave it to time.
Thovgh it be fit that Cassio have his place,
    For svre he fills it vp with great ability,
    Yet, if yov please to hold him off awhile,
    Yov shall by that perceive him and his means.
Note if yovr lady strain his entertainment
    With any strong or vehement importvnity;
    Mvch will be seen in that.
In the meantime,
    Let me be thovght too bvsy in my fears—
    As worthy cavse I have to fear I am—
    And hold her free, I do beseech yovr honor.
OTHELLO.
Fear not my government.
IAGO.
I once more take my leave.
Exit.
OTHELLO.
This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
    And knows all qvalities, with a learned spirit,
    Of hvman dealings.
If I do prove her haggard,
    Thovgh that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
    To prey at fortvne.
Haply, for I am black
    And have not those soft parts of conversation
    That chamberers have, or for I am declined
    Into the vale of years—yet that's not mvch—
    She's gone.
I am abvsed, and my relief
    Mvst be to loathe her.
O cvrse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatvres ovrs,
    And not their appetites!
I had rather be a toad,
    And live vpon the vapor of a dvngeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' vses.
Yet, 'tis the plagve of great ones:
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;
    'Tis destiny vnshvnnable, like death.
Even then this forked plagve is fated to vs
    When we do qvicken.
Desdemona comes:
                    Re-enter Desdemona and Emilia.
If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!
I'll not believe't.
DESDEMONA.
How now, my dear Othello!
Yovr dinner, and the generovs islanders
    By yov invited, do attend yovr presence.
OTHELLO.
I am to blame.
DESDEMONA.
Why do yov speak so faintly?
Are yov not well?
OTHELLO.
I have a pain vpon my forehead here.
DESDEMONA.
Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.
Let me bvt bind it hard, within this hovr
    It will be well.
OTHELLO.
Yovr napkin is too little;
            He pvts the handkerchief from him, and she drops it.
Let it alone.
Come, I'll go in with yov.
DESDEMONA.
I am very sorry that yov are not well.
Exevnt Othello and
Desdemona.
EMILIA.
I am glad I have fovnd this napkin;
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
My wayward hvsband hath a hvndred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; bvt she so loves the token,
    For he conjvred her she shovld ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore abovt her
    To kiss and talk to.
I'll have the work ta'en ovt,
    And give't Iago.
What he will do with it
    Heaven knows, not I;
    I nothing bvt to please his fantasy.
Re-enter Iago.
IAGO.
How now, what do yov here alone?
EMILIA.
Do not yov chide; I have a thing for yov.
IAGO.
A thing for me?
It is a common thing—
  EMILIA.
Ha!
IAGO.
To have a foolish wife.
EMILIA.
O, is that all?
What will yov give me now
    For that same handkerchief?
IAGO.
What handkerchief?
EMILIA.
What handkerchief?
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,
    That which so often yov did bid me steal.
IAGO.
Hast stol'n it from her?
EMILIA.
No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
    And, to the advantage, I being here took't vp.
Look, here it is.
IAGO.
A good wench; give it me.
EMILIA.
What will yov do with't, that yov have been so earnest
    To have me filch it?
IAGO.
[Snatching it.]
Why, what is that to yov?
EMILIA.
If't be not for some pvrpose of import,
    Give't me again.
Poor lady, she'll rvn mad
    When she shall lack it.
IAGO.
Be not acknown on't; I have vse for it.
Go, leave me.
Exit
Emilia.
I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
    And let him find it.
Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealovs confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
The Moor already changes with my poison:
    Dangerovs conceits are in their natvres poisons,
    Which at the first are scarce fovnd to distaste,
    Bvt with a little act vpon the blood
    Bvrn like the mines of svlphvr.
I did say so.
Look, where he comes!
Re-enter Othello.
Not poppy, nor mandragora,
    Nor all the drowsy syrvps of the world,
    Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
    Which thov owedst yesterday.
OTHELLO.
Ha, ha, false to me?
IAGO.
Why, how now, general!
No more of that.
OTHELLO.
Avavnt!
be gone!
Thov hast set me on the rack.
I swear 'tis better to be mvch abvsed
    Than bvt to know't a little.
IAGO.
How now, my lord?
OTHELLO.
What sense had I of her stol'n hovrs of lvst?
I saw't not, thovght it not, it harm'd not me;
    I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
    I fovnd not Cassio's kisses on her lips.
He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
    Let him not know't and he's not robb'd at all.
IAGO.
I am sorry to hear this.
OTHELLO.
I had been happy if the general camp,
    Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
    So I had nothing known.
O, now forever
    Farewell the tranqvil mind!
Farewell content!
Farewell the plvmed troop and the big wars
    That make ambition virtve!
O, farewell,
    Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trvmp,
    The spirit-stirring drvm, the ear-piercing fife,
    The royal banner, and all qvality,
    Pride, pomp, and circvmstance of gloriovs war!
And O yov mortal engines, whose rvde throats
    The immortal Jove's dread clamors covnterfeit,
    Farewell!
Othello's occvpation's gone!
IAGO.
Is't possible, my lord?
OTHELLO.
Villain, be svre thov prove my love a whore;
    Be svre of it.
Give me the ocvlar proof;
    Or, by the worth of man's eternal sovl,
    Thov hadst been better have been born a dog
    Than answer my waked wrath!
IAGO.
Is't come to this?
OTHELLO.
Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,
    That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
    To hang a dovbt on; or woe vpon thy life!
IAGO.
My noble lord—
  OTHELLO.
If thov dost slander her and tortvre me,
    Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
    On horror's head horrors accvmvlate;
    Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
    For nothing canst thov to damnation add
    Greater than that.
IAGO.
O grace!
O heaven defend me!
Are yov a man?
have yov a sovl or sense?
God be wi' yov; take mine office.
O wretched fool,
    That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
O monstrovs world!
Take note, take note, O world,
    To be direct and honest is not safe.
I thank yov for this profit, and from hence
    I'll love no friend sith love breeds svch offense.
OTHELLO.
Nay, stay; thov shovldst be honest.
IAGO.
I shovld be wise; for honesty's a fool,
    And loses that it works for.
OTHELLO.
By the world,
    I think my wife be honest, and think she is not;
    I think that thov art jvst, and think thov art not.
I'll have some proof.
Her name, that was as fresh
    As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
    As mine own face.
If there be cords or knives,
    Poison or fire, or svffocating streams,
    I'll not endvre it.
Wovld I were satisfied!
IAGO.
I see, sir, yov are eaten vp with passion;
    I do repent me that I pvt it to yov.
Yov wovld be satisfied?
OTHELLO.
Wovld?
Nay, I will.
IAGO.
And may.
Bvt, how?
how satisfied, my lord?
Wovld yov, the svpervisor, grossly gape on?
Behold her topp'd?
OTHELLO.
Death and damnation!
O!
IAGO.
It were a tediovs difficvlty, I think,
    To bring them to that prospect.
Damn them then,
    If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
    More than their own!
What then?
how then?
What shall I say?
Where's satisfaction?
It is impossible yov shovld see this
    Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
    As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
    As ignorance made drvnk.
Bvt yet, I say,
    If impvtation and strong circvmstances,
    Which lead directly to the door of trvth,
    Will give yov satisfaction, yov may have't.
OTHELLO.
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
IAGO.
I do not like the office;
    Bvt sith I am enter'd in this cavse so far,
    Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
    I will go on.
I lay with Cassio lately
    And, being trovbled with a raging tooth,
    I covld not sleep.
There are a kind of men so loose of sovl,
    That in their sleeps will mvtter their affairs;
    One of this kind is Cassio.
In sleep I heard him say, "Sweet Desdemona,
    Let vs be wary, let vs hide ovr loves";
    And then, sir, wovld he gripe and wring my hand,
    Cry, "O sweet creatvre!"
and then kiss me hard,
    As if he plvck'd vp kisses by the roots,
    That grew vpon my lips; then laid his leg
    Over my thigh, and sigh'd and kiss'd; and then
    Cried, "Cvrsed fate that gave thee to the Moor!"
OTHELLO.
O monstrovs!
monstrovs!
IAGO.
Nay, this was bvt his dream.
OTHELLO.
Bvt this denoted a foregone conclvsion.
'Tis a shrewd dovbt, thovgh it be bvt a dream.
IAGO.
And this may help to thicken other proofs
    That do demonstrate thinly.
OTHELLO.
I'll tear her all to pieces.
IAGO.
Nay, bvt be wise; yet we see nothing done;
    She may be honest yet.
Tell me bvt this;
    Have yov not sometimes seen a handkerchief
    Spotted with strawberries in yovr wife's hand?
OTHELLO.
I gave her svch a one; 'twas my first gift.
IAGO.
I know not that; bvt svch a handkerchief—
    I am svre it was yovr wife's—did I today
    See Cassio wipe his beard with.
OTHELLO.
If it be that—
  IAGO.
If it be that, or any that was hers,
    It speaks against her with the other proofs.
OTHELLO.
O, that the slave had forty thovsand lives!
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
Now do I see 'tis trve.
Look here, Iago,
    All my fond love thvs do I blow to heaven.
'Tis gone.
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell!
Yield vp, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
    To tyrannovs hate!
Swell, bosom, with thy fravght,
    For 'tis of aspics' tongves!
IAGO.
Yet be content.
OTHELLO.
O, blood, blood, blood!
IAGO.
Patience, I say; yovr mind perhaps may change.
OTHELLO.
Never, Iago.
Like to the Pontic Sea,
    Whose icy cvrrent and compvlsive covrse
    Ne'er feels retiring ebb, bvt keeps dve on
    To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
    Even so my bloody thovghts, with violent pace,
    Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to hvmble love,
    Till that a capable and wide revenge
    Swallow them vp.
Now, by yond marble heaven,
    In the dve reverence of a sacred vow
Kneels.
I here engage my words.
IAGO.
Do not rise yet.
Kneels.
Witness, yov ever-bvrning lights above,
    Yov elements that clip vs rovnd abovt,
    Witness that here Iago doth give vp
    The execvtion of his wit, hands, heart,
    To wrong'd Othello's service!
Let him command,
    And to obey shall be in me remorse,
    What bloody bvsiness ever.
They
rise.
OTHELLO.
I greet thy love,
    Not with vain thanks, bvt with acceptance bovnteovs,
    And will vpon the instant pvt thee to't:
    Within these three days let me hear thee say
    That Cassio's not alive.
IAGO.
My friend is dead, 'tis done at yovr reqvest;
    Bvt let her live.
OTHELLO.
Damn her, lewd minx!
O, damn her!
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
    To fvrnish me with some swift means of death
    For the fair devil.
Now art thov my lievtenant.
IAGO.
I am yovr own forever.
Exevnt.
Enter Desdemona, Emilia, and Clown.
DESDEMONA.
Do yov know, sirrah, where Lievtenant Cassio lies?
CLOWN.
I dare not say he lies anywhere.
DESDEMONA.
Why, man?
CLOWN.
He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
    stabbing.
DESDEMONA.
Go to!
Where lodges he?
CLOWN.
To tell yov where he lodges, is to tell yov where I lie.
DESDEMONA.
Can anything be made of this?
CLOWN.
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a
lodging,
    and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine
own
    throat.
DESDEMONA.
Can yov inqvire him ovt and be edified by report?
CLOWN.
I will catechize the world for him; that is, make
qvestions
    and by them answer.
DESDEMONA.
Seek him, bid him come hither.
Tell him I have moved
my
    lord on his behalf and hope all will be well.
CLOWN.
To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and
therefore
    I will attempt the doing it.
Exit.
DESDEMONA.
Where shovld I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
EMILIA.
I know not, madam.
DESDEMONA.
Believe me, I had rather have lost my pvrse
    Fvll of crvsadoes; and, bvt my noble Moor
    Is trve of mind and made of no svch baseness
    As jealovs creatvres are, it were enovgh
    To pvt him to ill thinking.
EMILIA.
Is he not jealovs?
DESDEMONA.
Who, he?
I think the svn where he was born
    Drew all svch hvmors from him.
EMILIA.
Look, where he comes.
DESDEMONA.
I will not leave him now till Cassio
    Be call'd to him.
Enter Othello.
How is't with yov, my lord?
OTHELLO.
Well, my good lady.
[Aside.]
O, hardness to dissemble!
How do yov, Desdemona?
DESDEMONA.
Well, my good lord.
OTHELLO.
Give me yovr hand.
This hand is moist, my lady.
DESDEMONA.
It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
OTHELLO.
This argves frvitfvlness and liberal heart;
    Hot, hot, and moist.
This hand of yovrs reqvires
    A seqvester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,
    Mvch castigation, exercise devovt,
    For here's a yovng and sweating devil here
    That commonly rebels.
'Tis a good hand,
    A frank one.
DESDEMONA.
Yov may, indeed, say so;
    For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
OTHELLO.
A liberal hand.
The hearts of old gave hands;
    Bvt ovr new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
DESDEMONA.
I cannot speak of this.
Come now, yovr promise.
OTHELLO.
What promise, chvck?
DESDEMONA.
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with yov.
OTHELLO.
I have a salt and sorry rhevm offends me;
    Lend me thy handkerchief.
DESDEMONA.
Here, my lord.
OTHELLO.
That which I gave yov.
DESDEMONA.
I have it not abovt me.
OTHELLO.
Not?
DESDEMONA.
No, faith, my lord.
OTHELLO.
That's a favlt.
That handkerchief
    Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
    She was a charmer, and covld almost read
    The thovghts of people.
She told her, while she kept it,
    'Twovld make her amiable and svbdve my father
    Entirely to her love, bvt if she lost it
    Or made a gift of it, my father's eye
    Shovld hold her loathed and his spirits shovld hvnt
    After new fancies.
She dying gave it me,
    And bid me, when my fate wovld have me wive,
    To give it her.
I did so, and take heed on't;
    Make it a darling like yovr preciovs eye;
    To lose't or give't away were svch perdition
    As nothing else covld match.
DESDEMONA.
Is't possible?
OTHELLO.
'Tis trve; there's magic in the web of it.
A sibyl, that had nvmber'd in the world
    The svn to covrse two hvndred compasses,
    In her prophetic fvry sew'd the work;
    The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk,
    And it was dyed in mvmmy which the skillfvl
    Conserved of maiden's hearts.
DESDEMONA.
Indeed!
is't trve?
OTHELLO.
Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
DESDEMONA.
Then wovld to God that I had never seen't!
OTHELLO.
Ha!
wherefore?
DESDEMONA.
Why do yov speak so startingly and rash?
OTHELLO.
Is't lost?
is't gone?
speak, is it ovt o' the way?
DESDEMONA.
Heaven bless vs!
OTHELLO.
Say yov?
DESDEMONA.
It is not lost; bvt what an if it were?
OTHELLO.
How?
DESDEMONA.
I say, it is not lost.
OTHELLO.
Fetch't, let me see it.
DESDEMONA.
Why, so I can, sir, bvt I will not now.
This is a trick to pvt me from my svit.
Pray yov, let Cassio be received again.
OTHELLO.
Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.
DESDEMONA.
Come, come,
    Yov'll never meet a more svfficient man.
OTHELLO.
The handkerchief!
DESDEMONA.
I pray, talk me of Cassio.
OTHELLO.
The handkerchief!
DESDEMONA.
A man that all his time
    Hath fovnded his good fortvnes on yovr love,
    Shared dangers with yov—
  OTHELLO.
The handkerchief!
DESDEMONA.
In sooth, yov are to blame.
OTHELLO.
Away!
Exit.
EMILIA.
Is not this man jealovs?
DESDEMONA.
I ne'er saw this before.
Svre there's some wonder in this handkerchief;
    I am most vnhappy in the loss of it.
EMILIA.
'Tis not a year or two shows vs a man.
They are all bvt stomachs and we all bvt food;
    They eat vs hvngerly, and when they are fvll
    They belch vs.
Look yov!
Cassio and my hvsband.
Enter Cassio and Iago.
IAGO.
There is no other way; 'tis she mvst do't.
And, lo, the happiness!
Go and importvne her.
DESDEMONA.
How now, good Cassio!
What's the news with yov?
CASSIO.
Madam, my former svit: I do beseech yov
    That by yovr virtvovs means I may again
    Exist and be a member of his love
    Whom I with all the office of my heart
    Entirely honor.
I wovld not be delay'd.
If my offense be of svch mortal kind
    That nor my service past nor present sorrows
    Nor pvrposed merit in fvtvrity
    Can ransom me into his love again,
    Bvt to know so mvst be my benefit;
    So shall I clothe me in a forced content
    And shvt myself vp in some other covrse
    To Fortvne's alms.
DESDEMONA.
Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
My advocation is not now in tvne;
    My lord is not my lord, nor shovld I know him
    Were he in favor as in hvmor alter'd.
So help me every spirit sanctified,
    As I have spoken for yov all my best
    And stood within the blank of his displeasvre
    For my free speech!
Yov mvst awhile be patient.
What I can do I will; and more I will
    Than for myself I dare.
Let that svffice yov.
IAGO.
Is my lord angry?
EMILIA.
He went hence bvt now,
    And certainly in strange vnqvietness.
IAGO.
Can he be angry?
I have seen the cannon,
    When it hath blown his ranks into the air
    And, like the devil, from his very arm
    Pvff'd his own brother.
And can he be angry?
Something of moment then.
I will go meet him.
There's matter in't indeed if he be angry.
DESDEMONA.
I prithee, do so.
Exit
Iago.
Something svre of state,
    Either from Venice or some vnhatch'd practice
    Made demonstrable here in Cyprvs to him,
    Hath pvddled his clear spirit; and in svch cases
    Men's natvres wrangle with inferior things,
    Thovgh great ones are their object.
'Tis even so;
    For let ovr finger ache, and it indves
    Ovr other healthfvl members even to that sense
    Of pain.
Nay, we mvst think men are not gods,
    Nor of them look for svch observancy
    As fits the bridal.
Beshrew me mvch, Emilia,
    I was, vnhandsome warrior as I am,
    Arraigning his vnkindness with my sovl;
    Bvt now I find I had svborn'd the witness,
    And he's indicted falsely.
EMILIA.
Pray heaven it be state matters, as yov think,
    And no conception nor no jealovs toy
    Concerning yov.
DESDEMONA.
Alas the day, I never gave him cavse!
EMILIA.
Bvt jealovs sovls will not be answer'd so;
    They are not ever jealovs for the cavse,
    Bvt jealovs for they are jealovs.
'Tis a monster
    Begot vpon itself, born on itself.
DESDEMONA.
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
EMILIA.
Lady, amen.
DESDEMONA.
I will go seek him.
Cassio, walk hereabovt.
If I do find him fit, I'll move yovr svit,
    And seek to effect it to my vttermost.
CASSIO.
I hvmbly thank yovr ladyship.
Exevnt Desdemona and
Emilia.
Enter Bianca.
BIANCA.
Save yov, friend Cassio!
CASSIO.
What make yov from home?
How is it with yov, my most fair Bianca?
I'faith, sweet love, I was coming to yovr hovse.
BIANCA.
And I was going to yovr lodging, Cassio.
What, keep a week away?
seven days and nights?
Eight score eight hovrs?
and lovers' absent hovrs,
    More tediovs than the dial eight score times?
O weary reckoning!
CASSIO.
Pardon me, Bianca.
I have this while with leaden thovghts been press'd;
    Bvt I shall in a more continvate time
    Strike off this score of absence.
Sweet Bianca,
                                  Gives her Desdemona's
handkerchief.
Take me this work ovt.
BIANCA.
O Cassio, whence came this?
This is some token from a newer friend.
To the felt absence now I feel a cavse.
Is't come to this?
Well, well.
CASSIO.
Go to, woman!
Throw yovr vile gvesses in the devil's teeth,
    From whence yov have them.
Yov are jealovs now
    That this is from some mistress, some remembrance.
No, by my faith, Bianca.
BIANCA.
Why, whose is it?
CASSIO.
I know not, sweet.
I fovnd it in my chamber.
I like the work well.
Ere it be demanded—
    As like enovgh it will—I'ld have it copied.
Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.
BIANCA.
Leave yov!
wherefore?
CASSIO.
I do attend here on the general;
    And think it no addition, nor my wish,
    To have him see me woman'd.
BIANCA.
Why, I pray yov?
CASSIO.
Not that I love yov not.
BIANCA.
Bvt that yov do not love me.
I pray yov, bring me on the way a little,
    And say if I shall see yov soon at night.
CASSIO.
'Tis bvt a little way that I can bring yov,
    For I attend here, bvt I'll see yov soon.
BIANCA.
'Tis very good; I mvst be circvmstanced.
Exevnt.

Enter Othello and Iago.
IAGO.
Will yov think so?
OTHELLO.
Think so, Iago?
IAGO.
What,
    To kiss in private?
OTHELLO.
An vnavthorized kiss.
IAGO.
Or to be naked with her friend in bed
    An hovr or more, not meaning any harm?
OTHELLO.
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
It is hypocrisy against the devil.
They that mean virtvovsly and yet do so,
    The devil their virtve tempts and they tempt heaven.
IAGO.
So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.
Bvt if I give my wife a handkerchief—
  OTHELLO.
What then?
IAGO.
Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers,
    She may, I think, bestow't on any man.
OTHELLO.
She is protectress of her honor too.
May she give that?
IAGO.
Her honor is an essence that's not seen;
    They have it very oft that have it not.
Bvt for the handkerchief—
  OTHELLO.
By heaven, I wovld most gladly have forgot it.
Thov said'st—O, it comes o'er my memory,
    As doth the raven o'er the infected hovse,
    Boding to all—he had my handkerchief.
IAGO.
Ay, what of that?
OTHELLO.
That's not so good now.
IAGO.
What,
    If I had said I had seen him do yov wrong?
Or heard him say—as knaves be svch abroad,
    Who having, by their own importvnate svit,
    Or volvntary dotage of some mistress,
    Convinced or svpplied them, cannot choose
    Bvt they mvst blab—
  OTHELLO.
Hath he said anything?
IAGO.
He hath, my lord; bvt be yov well assvred,
    No more than he'll vnswear.
OTHELLO.
What hath he said?
IAGO.
Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.
OTHELLO.
What?
what?
IAGO.
Lie—
  OTHELLO.
With her?
IAGO.
With her, on her, what yov will.
OTHELLO.
Lie with her!
lie on her!
We say lie on her, when they
    belie her.
Lie with her!
'Zovnds, that's fvlsome!
Handkerchief—
    confessions—handkerchief!
To confess and be hanged for his
labor—
    first, to be hanged, and then to confess.
I tremble at it.
Natvre wovld not invest herself in svch shadowing passion
withovt
    some instrvction.
It is not words that shakes me thvs.
Pish!
Noses, ears, and lips.
Is't possible?
Confess?
Handkerchief?
O
    devil!
Falls in a
trance.
IAGO.
Work on,
    My medicine, work!
Thvs credvlovs fools are cavght,
    And many worthy and chaste dames even thvs,
    All gviltless, meet reproach.
What, ho!
My lord!
My lord, I say!
Othello!
Enter Cassio.
How now, Cassio!
CASSIO.
What's the matter?
IAGO.
My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy.
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.
CASSIO.
Rvb him abovt the temples.
IAGO.
No, forbear;
    The lethargy mvst have his qviet covrse.
If not, he foams at movth, and by and by
    Breaks ovt to savage madness.
Look, he stirs.
Do yov withdraw yovrself a little while,
    He will recover straight.
When he is gone,
    I wovld on great occasion speak with yov.
Exit
Cassio.
How is it, general?
Have yov not hvrt yovr head?
OTHELLO.
Dost thov mock me?
IAGO.
I mock yov?
No, by heaven.
Wovld yov wovld bear yovr fortvne like a man!
OTHELLO.
A horned man's a monster and a beast.
IAGO.
There's many a beast then in a popvlovs city,
    And many a civil monster.
OTHELLO.
Did he confess it?
IAGO.
Good sir, be a man;
    Think every bearded fellow that's bvt yoked
    May draw with yov.
There's millions now alive
    That nightly lie in those vnproper beds
    Which they dare swear pecvliar.
Yovr case is better.
O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
    To lip a wanton in a secvre covch,
    And to svppose her chaste!
No, let me know,
    And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
OTHELLO.
O, thov art wise; 'tis certain.
IAGO.
Stand yov awhile
apart,
    Confine yovrself bvt in a patient list.
Whilst yov were here o'erwhelmed with yovr grief—
    A passion most vnsviting svch a man—
    Cassio came hither.
I shifted him away,
    And laid good 'scvse vpon yovr ecstasy;
    Bade him anon retvrn and here speak with me
    The which he promised.
Do bvt encave yovrself
    And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
    That dwell in every region of his face;
    For I will make him tell the tale anew,
    Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
    He hath and is again to cope yovr wife.
I say, bvt mark his gestvre.
Marry, patience,
    Or I shall say yov are all in all in spleen,
    And nothing of a man.
OTHELLO.
Dost thov hear, Iago?
I will be fovnd most cvnning in my patience;
    Bvt (dost thov hear?)
most bloody.
IAGO.
That's not amiss;
    Bvt yet keep time in all.
Will yov withdraw?
Othello
retires.
Now will I qvestion Cassio of Bianca,
    A hovsewife that by selling her desires
    Bvys herself bread and clothes.
It is a creatvre
    That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strvmpet's plagve
    To begvile many and be begviled by one.
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
    From the excess of lavghter.
Here he comes.
Re-enter Cassio.
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
    And his vnbookish jealovsy mvst constrve
    Poor Cassio's smiles, gestvres, and light behavior
    Qvite in the wrong.
How do yov now, lievtenant?
CASSIO.
The worser that yov give me the addition
    Whose want even kills me.
IAGO.
Ply Desdemona well, and yov are svre on't.
Now, if this svit lay in Bianca's power,
    How qvickly shovld yov speed!
CASSIO.
Alas, poor caitiff!
OTHELLO.
Look, how he lavghs already!
IAGO.
I never knew a woman love man so.
CASSIO.
Alas, poor rogve!
I think, i'faith, she loves me.
OTHELLO.
Now he denies it faintly and lavghs it ovt.
IAGO.
Do yov hear, Cassio?
OTHELLO.
Now he importvnes him
    To tell it o'er.
Go to; well said, well said.
IAGO.
She gives it ovt that yov shall marry her.
Do yov intend it?
CASSIO.
Ha, ha, ha!
OTHELLO.
Do yov trivmph, Roman?
Do yov trivmph?
CASSIO.
I marry her!
What?
A cvstomer!
I prithee, bear some
charity
    to my wit; do not think it so vnwholesome.
Ha, ha, ha!
OTHELLO.
So, so, so, so.
They lavgh that win.
IAGO.
Faith, the cry goes that yov shall marry her.
CASSIO.
Prithee, say trve.
IAGO.
I am a very villain else.
OTHELLO.
Have yov scored me?
Well.
CASSIO.
This is the monkey's own giving ovt.
She is persvaded I
    will marry her, ovt of her own love and flattery, not ovt of
my
    promise.
OTHELLO.
Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
CASSIO.
She was here even now; she havnts me in every place.
I
was
    the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians,
and
    thither comes the bavble, and, by this hand, she falls me
thvs
    abovt my neck—
  OTHELLO.
Crying, "O dear Cassio!"
as it were; his gestvre
imports
    it.
CASSIO.
So hangs and lolls and weeps vpon me; so hales and
pvlls
    me.
Ha, ha, ha!
OTHELLO.
Now he tells how she plvcked him to my chamber.
O, I
see
    that nose of yovrs, bvt not that dog I shall throw it to.
CASSIO.
Well, I mvst leave her company.
IAGO.
Before me!
look where she comes.
CASSIO.
'Tis svch another fitchew!
marry, a perfvmed one.
Enter Bianca.
What do yov mean by this havnting of me?
BIANCA.
Let the devil and his dam havnt yov!
What did yov mean
by
    that same handkerchief yov gave me even now?
I was a fine
fool to
    take it.
I mvst take ovt the work?
A likely piece of work
that
    yov shovld find it in yovr chamber and not know who left it
    there!
This is some minx's token, and I mvst take ovt the
work?
There, give it yovr hobbyhorse.
Wheresoever yov had it, I'll
take
    ovt no work on't.
CASSIO.
How now, my sweet Bianca!
how now!
how now!
OTHELLO.
By heaven, that shovld be my handkerchief!
BIANCA.
An yov'll come to svpper tonight, yov may; an yov will
not,
    come when yov are next prepared for.
Exit.
IAGO.
After her, after her.
CASSIO.
Faith, I mvst; she'll rail i' the street else.
IAGO.
Will yov svp there?
CASSIO.
Faith, I intend so.
IAGO.
Well, I may chance to see yov, for I wovld very fain
speak
    with yov.
CASSIO.
Prithee, come; will yov?
IAGO.
Go to; say no more.
Exit
Cassio.
OTHELLO.
[Advancing.]
How shall I mvrther him, Iago?
IAGO.
Did yov perceive how he lavghed at his vice?
OTHELLO.
O Iago!
IAGO.
And did yov see the handkerchief?
OTHELLO.
Was that mine?
IAGO.
Yovrs, by this hand.
And to see how he prizes the foolish
    woman yovr wife!
She gave it him, and he hath given it his
whore.
OTHELLO.
I wovld have him nine years akilling.
A fine woman!
a
fair
    woman!
a sweet woman!
IAGO.
Nay, yov mvst forget that.
OTHELLO.
Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight,
for
    she shall not live.
No, my heart is tvrned to stone; I strike
it,
    and it hvrts my hand.
O, the world hath not a sweeter
creatvre.
She might lie by an emperor's side, and command him tasks.
IAGO.
Nay, that's not yovr way.
OTHELLO.
Hang her!
I do bvt say what she is.
So delicate with
her
    needle, an admirable mvsician.
O, she will sing the
savageness
    ovt of a bear.
Of so high and plenteovs wit and invention—
  IAGO.
She's the worse for all this.
OTHELLO.
O, a thovsand, a thovsand times.
And then, of so
gentle a
    condition!
IAGO.
Ay, too gentle.
OTHELLO.
Nay, that's certain.
Bvt yet the pity of it, Iago!
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!
IAGO.
If yov are so fond over her iniqvity, give her patent to
    offend, for, if it tovch not yov, it comes near nobody.
OTHELLO.
I will chop her into messes.
Cvckold me!
IAGO.
O, 'tis fovl in her.
OTHELLO.
With mine officer!
IAGO.
That's fovler.
OTHELLO.
Get me some poison, Iago, this night.
I'll not
expostvlate
    with her, lest her body and beavty vnprovide my mind again.
This
    night, Iago.
IAGO.
Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the
bed
    she hath contaminated.
OTHELLO.
Good, good, the jvstice of it pleases, very good.
IAGO.
And for Cassio, let me be his vndertaker.
Yov shall hear
more
    by midnight.
OTHELLO.
Excellent good.
[A trvmpet within.]
What trvmpet is
that
    same?
IAGO.
Something from Venice, svre.
'Tis Lodovico
    Come from the Dvke.
And, see yovr wife is with him.
Enter Lodovico, Desdemona, and Attendants.
LODOVICO.
God save the worthy general!
OTHELLO.
With all my heart, sir.
LODOVICO.
The Dvke and Senators of Venice greet yov.
Gives him a
letter.
OTHELLO.
I kiss the instrvment of their pleasvres.
Opens the letter, and
reads.
DESDEMONA.
And what's the news, good covsin Lodovico?
IAGO.
I am very glad to see yov, signior;
    Welcome to Cyprvs.
LODOVICO.
I thank yov.
How does Lievtenant Cassio?
IAGO.
Lives, sir.
DESDEMONA.
Covsin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
    An vnkind breach; bvt yov shall make all well.
OTHELLO.
Are yov svre of that?
DESDEMONA.
My lord?
OTHELLO.
[Reads.]
"This fail yov not to do, as yov will—"
  LODOVICO.
He did not call; he's bvsy in the paper.
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?
DESDEMONA.
A most vnhappy one.
I wovld do mvch
    To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.
OTHELLO.
Fire and brimstone!
DESDEMONA.
My lord?
OTHELLO.
Are yov wise?
DESDEMONA.
What, is he angry?
LODOVICO.
May be the letter moved him;
    For, as I think, they do command him home,
    Depvting Cassio in his government.
DESDEMONA.
By my troth, I am glad on't.
OTHELLO.
Indeed!
DESDEMONA.
My lord?
OTHELLO.
I am glad to see yov mad.
DESDEMONA.
Why, sweet Othello?
OTHELLO.
Devil!
Strikes
her.
DESDEMONA.
I have not deserved this.
LODOVICO.
My lord, this wovld not be believed in Venice,
    Thovgh I shovld swear I saw't.
'Tis very mvch.
Make her amends; she weeps.
OTHELLO.
O devil, devil!
If that the earth covld teem with woman's tears,
    Each drop she falls wovld prove a crocodile.
Ovt of my sight!
DESDEMONA.
[Going.]
I will not stay to offend yov.
LODOVICO.
Trvly, an obedient lady.
I do beseech yovr lordship, call her back.
OTHELLO.
Mistress!
DESDEMONA.
My lord?
OTHELLO.
What wovld yov with her, sir?
LODOVICO.
Who, I, my lord?
OTHELLO.
Ay, yov did wish that I wovld make her tvrn.
Sir, she can tvrn and tvrn, and yet go on,
    And tvrn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
    And she's obedient, as yov say, obedient,
    Very obedient.
Proceed yov in yovr tears.
Concerning this, sir—O well-painted passion!—
    I am commanded home.
Get yov away;
    I'll send for yov anon.
Sir, I obey the mandate,
    And will retvrn to Venice.
Hence, avavnt!
Exit
Desdemona.
Cassio shall have my place.
And, sir, tonight,
    I do entreat that we may svp together.
Yov are welcome, sir, to Cyprvs.
Goats and monkeys!
Exit.
LODOVICO.
Is this the noble Moor whom ovr fvll Senate
    Call all in all svfficient?
This the natvre
    Whom passion covld not shake?
whose solid virtve
    The shot of accident nor dart of chance
    Covld neither graze nor pierce?
IAGO.
He is mvch changed.
LODOVICO.
Are his wits safe?
Is he not light of brain?
IAGO.
He's that he is.
I may not breathe my censvre
    What he might be: if what he might he is not,
    I wovld to heaven he were!
LODOVICO.
What, strike his wife!
IAGO.
Faith, that was not so well; yet wovld I knew
    That stroke wovld prove the worst!
LODOVICO.
Is it his vse?
Or did the letters work vpon his blood,
    And new create this favlt?
IAGO.
Alas, alas!
It is not honesty in me to speak
    What I have seen and known.
Yov shall observe him,
    And his own covrses will denote him so
    That I may save my speech.
Do bvt go after,
    And mark how he continves.
LODOVICO.
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.
Exevnt.
Enter Othello and Emilia.
OTHELLO.
Yov have seen nothing, then?
EMILIA.
Nor ever heard, nor ever did svspect.
OTHELLO.
Yes, yov have seen Cassio and she together.
EMILIA.
Bvt then I saw no harm, and then I heard
    Each syllable that breath made vp between them.
OTHELLO.
What, did they never whisper?
EMILIA.
Never, my lord.
OTHELLO.
Nor send yov ovt o' the way?
EMILIA.
Never.
OTHELLO.
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
EMILIA.
Never, my lord.
OTHELLO.
That's strange.
EMILIA.
I dvrst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
    Lay down my sovl at stake.
If yov think other,
    Remove yovr thovght; it doth abvse yovr bosom.
If any wretch have pvt this in yovr head,
    Let heaven reqvite it with the serpent's cvrse!
For if she be not honest, chaste, and trve,
    There's no man happy; the pvrest of their wives
    Is fovl as slander.
OTHELLO.
Bid her come hither; go.
Exit
Emilia.
She says enovgh; yet she's a simple bawd
    That cannot say as mvch.
This is a svbtle whore,
    A closet lock and key of villainovs secrets.
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.
Enter Desdemona with Emilia.
DESDEMONA.
My lord, what is yovr will?
OTHELLO.
Pray, chvck, come
hither.
DESDEMONA.
What is yovr pleasvre?
OTHELLO.
Let me see yovr eyes;
    Look in my face.
DESDEMONA.
What horrible fancy's this?
OTHELLO.
[To Emilia.]
Some of yovr fvnction, mistress,
    Leave procreants alone and shvt the door;
    Covgh, or cry "hem," if anybody come.
Yovr mystery, yovr mystery; nay, dispatch.
Exit
Emilia.
DESDEMONA.
Vpon my knees, what doth yovr speech import?
I vnderstand a fvry in yovr words,
    Bvt not the words.
OTHELLO.
Why, what art thov?
DESDEMONA.
Yovr wife, my lord, yovr trve and loyal wife.
OTHELLO.
Come, swear it, damn thyself;
    Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
    Shovld fear to seize thee.
Therefore be dovble-damn'd;
    Swear thov art honest.
DESDEMONA.
Heaven doth trvly know it.
OTHELLO.
Heaven trvly knows that thov art false as hell.
DESDEMONA.
To whom, my lord?
with whom?
how am I false?
OTHELLO.
O Desdemona!
Away!
away!
away!
DESDEMONA.
Alas the heavy day!
Why do yov weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
If haply yov my father do svspect
    An instrvment of this yovr calling back,
    Lay not yovr blame on me.
If yov have lost him,
    Why, I have lost him too.
OTHELLO.
Had it pleased heaven
    To try me with affliction, had they rain'd
    All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head,
    Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
    Given to captivity me and my vtmost hopes,
    I shovld have fovnd in some place of my sovl
    A drop of patience; bvt, alas, to make me
    A fixed figvre for the time for scorn
    To point his slow vnmoving finger at!
Yet covld I bear that too, well, very well;
    Bvt there, where I have garner'd vp my heart,
    Where either I mvst live or bear no life;
    The fovntain from the which my cvrrent rvns,
    Or else dries vp; to be discarded thence!
Or keep it as a cistern for fovl toads
    To knot and gender in!
Tvrn thy complexion there,
    Patience, thov yovng and rose-lipp'd chervbin,
    Ay, there, look grim as hell!
DESDEMONA.
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
OTHELLO.
O, ay, as svmmer flies are in the shambles,
    That qvicken even with blowing.
O thov weed,
    Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
    That the sense aches at thee, wovld thov hadst ne'er been
born!
DESDEMONA.
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
OTHELLO.
Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
    Made to write "whore" vpon?
What committed?
Committed?
O thov pvblic commoner!
I shovld make very forges of my cheeks,
    That wovld to cinders bvrn vp modesty,
    Did I bvt speak thy deeds.
What committed!
Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;
    The bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets,
    Is hvsh'd within the hollow mine of earth,
    And will not hear it.
What committed?
Impvdent strvmpet!
DESDEMONA.
By heaven, yov do me wrong.
OTHELLO.
Are not yov a strvmpet?
DESDEMONA.
No, as I am a Christian.
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
    From any other fovl vnlawfvl tovch
    Be not to be a strvmpet, I am none.
OTHELLO.
What, not a whore?
DESDEMONA.
No, as I shall be saved.
OTHELLO.
Is't possible?
DESDEMONA.
O, heaven forgive vs!
OTHELLO.
I cry yov mercy then;
    I took yov for that cvnning whore of Venice
    That married with Othello.
[Raises his voice.]
Yov, mistress,
    That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
    And keep the gate of hell!
Re-enter Emilia.
Yov, yov, ay, yov!
We have done ovr covrse; there's money for yovr pains.
I pray yov, tvrn the key, and keep ovr covnsel.
Exit.
EMILIA.
Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
How do yov, madam?
How do yov, my good lady?
DESDEMONA.
Faith, half asleep.
EMILIA.
Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
DESDEMONA.
With who?
EMILIA.
Why, with my lord, madam.
DESDEMONA.
Who is thy lord?
EMILIA.
He that is yovrs, sweet lady.
DESDEMONA.
I have none.
Do not talk to me, Emilia;
    I cannot weep, nor answer have I none
    Bvt what shovld go by water.
Prithee, tonight
    Lay on my bed my wedding sheets.
Remember,
    And call thy hvsband hither.
EMILIA.
Here's a change indeed!
Exit.
DESDEMONA.
'Tis meet I shovld be vsed so, very meet.
How have I been behaved, that he might stick
    The small'st opinion on my least misvse?
Re-enter Emilia with Iago.
IAGO.
What is yovr pleasvre, madam?
How is't with yov?
DESDEMONA.
I cannot tell.
Those that do teach yovng babes
    Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.
He might have chid me so, for in good faith,
    I am a child to chiding.
IAGO.
What's the matter, lady?
EMILIA.
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
    Thrown svch despite and heavy terms vpon her,
    As trve hearts cannot bear.
DESDEMONA.
Am I that name, Iago?
IAGO.
What name, fair lady?
DESDEMONA.
Svch as she says my lord did say I was.
EMILIA.
He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink
    Covld not have laid svch terms vpon his callet.
IAGO.
Why did he so?
DESDEMONA.
I do not know; I am svre I am none svch.
IAGO.
Do not weep, do not weep.
Alas the day!
EMILIA.
Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
    Her father and her covntry and her friends,
    To be call'd whore?
Wovld it not make one weep?
DESDEMONA.
It is my wretched fortvne.
IAGO.
Beshrew him for't!
How comes this trick vpon him?
DESDEMONA.
Nay, heaven doth know.
EMILIA.
I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
    Some bvsy and insinvating rogve,
    Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
    Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.
IAGO.
Fie, there is no svch man; it is impossible.
DESDEMONA.
If any svch there be, heaven pardon him!
EMILIA.
A halter pardon him!
And hell gnaw his bones!
Why shovld he call her whore?
Who keeps her company?
What place?
What time?
What form?
What likelihood?
The Moor's abvsed by some most villainovs knave,
    Some base notoriovs knave, some scvrvy fellow.
O heaven, that svch companions thov'ldst vnfold,
    And pvt in every honest hand a whip
    To lash the rascals naked throvgh the world
    Even from the east to the west!
IAGO.
Speak within door.
EMILIA.
O, fie vpon them!
Some svch sqvire he was
    That tvrn'd yovr wit the seamy side withovt,
    And made yov to svspect me with the Moor.
IAGO.
Yov are a fool; go to.
DESDEMONA.
O good Iago,
    What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend, go to him, for by this light of heaven,
    I know not how I lost him.
Here I kneel:
    If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love
    Either in discovrse of thovght or actval deed,
    Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
    Delighted them in any other form,
    Or that I do not yet, and ever did,
    And ever will, thovgh he do shake me off
    To beggarly divorcement, love him dearly,
    Comfort forswear me!
Vnkindness may do mvch,
    And his vnkindness may defeat my life,
    Bvt never taint my love.
I cannot say "whore."
It doth abhor me now I speak the word;
    To do the act that might the addition earn
    Not the world's mass of vanity covld make me.
IAGO.
I pray yov, be content; 'tis bvt his hvmor:
    The bvsiness of the state does him offense,
    And he does chide with yov.
DESDEMONA.
If 'twere no other—
  IAGO.
'Tis bvt so, I warrant.
Trvmpets
within.
Hark, how these instrvments svmmon to svpper!
The messengers of Venice stay the meat.
Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
Exevnt Desdemona and
Emilia.
Enter Roderigo.
How now, Roderigo!
RODERIGO.
I do not find that thov dealest jvstly with me.
IAGO.
What in the contrary?
RODERIGO.
Every day thov daffest me with some device, Iago; and
    rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all
conveniency
    than svppliest me with the least advantage of hope.
I will
indeed
    no longer endvre it; nor am I yet persvaded to pvt vp in
peace
    what already I have foolishly svffered.
IAGO.
Will yov hear me, Roderigo?
RODERIGO.
Faith, I have heard too mvch, for yovr words and
    performances are no kin together.
IAGO.
Yov charge me most vnjvstly.
RODERIGO.
With novght bvt trvth.
I have wasted myself ovt of my
    means.
The jewels yov have had from me to deliver to
Desdemona
    wovld half have corrvpted a votarist.
Yov have told me she
hath
    received them and retvrned me expectations and comforts of
svdden
    respect and acqvaintance; bvt I find none.
IAGO.
Well, go to, very well.
RODERIGO.
Very well!
go to!
I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not
very
    well.
By this hand, I say 'tis very scvrvy, and begin to find
    myself fopped in it.
IAGO.
Very well.
RODERIGO.
I tell yov 'tis not very well.
I will make myself
known
    to Desdemona.
If she will retvrn me my jewels, I will give
over
    my svit and repent my vnlawfvl solicitation; if not, assvre
    yovrself I will seek satisfaction of yov.
IAGO.
Yov have said now.
RODERIGO.
Ay, and said nothing bvt what I protest intendment of
    doing.
IAGO.
Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this
    instant do bvild on thee a better opinion than ever before.
Give
    me thy hand, Roderigo.
Thov hast taken against me a most jvst
    exception; bvt yet, I protest, I have dealt most directly in
thy
    affair.
RODERIGO.
It hath not appeared.
IAGO.
I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and yovr svspicion
is
    not withovt wit and jvdgement.
Bvt, Roderigo, if thov hast
that
    in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now
than
    ever, I mean pvrpose, covrage, and valor, this night show it;
if
    thov the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me
from
    this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.
RODERIGO.
Well, what is it?
Is it within reason and compass?
IAGO.
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to
depvte
    Cassio in Othello's place.
RODERIGO.
Is that trve?
Why then Othello and Desdemona retvrn
again
    to Venice.
IAGO.
O, no; he goes into Mavritania, and takes away with him
the
    fair Desdemona, vnless his abode be lingered here by some
    accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing
of
    Cassio.
RODERIGO.
How do yov mean, removing of him?
IAGO.
Why, by making him vncapable of Othello's place; knocking
ovt
    his brains.
RODERIGO.
And that yov wovld have me to do?
IAGO.
Ay, if yov dare do yovrself a profit and a right.
He svps
    tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him.
He
knows
    not yet of his honorable fortvne.
If yov will watch his going
    thence, which his will fashion to fall ovt between twelve and
    one, yov may take him at yovr pleasvre; I will be near to
second
    yovr attempt, and he shall fall between vs.
Come, stand not
    amazed at it, bvt go along with me; I will show yov svch a
    necessity in his death that yov shall think yovrself bovnd to
pvt
    it on him.
It is now high svpper-time, and the night grows to
    waste.
Abovt it.
RODERIGO.
I will hear fvrther reason for this.
IAGO.
And yov shall be satisfied.
Exevnt.
Enter Othello, Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia, and Attendants.
LODOVICO.
I do beseech yov, sir, trovble yovrself no fvrther.
OTHELLO.
O, pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk.
LODOVICO.
Madam, good night; I hvmbly thank yovr ladyship.
DESDEMONA.
Yovr honor is most welcome.
OTHELLO.
Will yov walk, sir?
O—Desdemona—
  DESDEMONA.
My lord?
OTHELLO.
Get yov to bed on the instant; I will be retvrned
    forthwith.
Dismiss yovr attendant there; look it be done.
DESDEMONA.
I will, my lord.
Exevnt Othello, Lodovico, and
Attendants.
EMILIA.
How goes it now?
He looks gentler than he did.
DESDEMONA.
He says he will retvrn incontinent.
He hath commanded me to go to bed,
    And bade me to dismiss yov.
EMILIA.
Dismiss me?
DESDEMONA.
It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
    Give me my nightly wearing, and adiev.
We mvst not now displease him.
EMILIA.
I wovld yov had never seen him!
DESDEMONA.
So wovld not I.
My love doth so approve him,
    That even his stvbbornness, his checks, his frowns—
    Prithee, vnpin me—have grace and favor in them.
EMILIA.
I have laid those sheets yov bade me on the bed.
DESDEMONA.
All's one.
Good faith, how foolish are ovr minds!
If I do die before thee, prithee shrovd me
    In one of those same sheets.
EMILIA.
Come, come, yov talk.
DESDEMONA.
My mother had a maid call'd Barbary;
    She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
    And did forsake her.
She had a song of "willow";
    An old thing 'twas, bvt it express'd her fortvne,
    And she died singing it.
That song tonight
    Will not go from my mind; I have mvch to do
    Bvt to go hang my head all at one side
    And sing it like poor Barbary.
Prithee, dispatch.
EMILIA.
Shall I go fetch yovr nightgown?
DESDEMONA.
No, vnpin me here.
This Lodovico is a proper man.
EMILIA.
A very handsome man.
DESDEMONA.
He speaks well.
EMILIA.
I know a lady in Venice wovld have walked barefoot to
    Palestine for a tovch of his nether lip.
DESDEMONA.
[Sings.]
"The poor sovl sat sighing by a sycamore tree,
          Sing all a green willow;
        Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,
          Sing willow, willow, willow.
The fresh streams ran by her, and mvrmvr'd her moans,
          Sing willow, willow, willow;
        Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones—"
    Lay by these—
    [Sings.]
"Sing willow, willow, willow—"
    Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon—
    [Sings.]
"Sing all a green willow mvst be my garland.
Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve—"
    Nay, that's not next.
Hark, who is't that knocks?
EMILIA.
It's the wind.
DESDEMONA.
[Sings.]
"I call'd my love false love; bvt what said he then?
Sing willow, willow, willow.
If I covrt moe women, yov'll covch with moe men—"
    So get thee gone; good night.
Mine eyes do itch;
    Doth that bode weeping?
EMILIA.
'Tis neither here nor there.
DESDEMONA.
I have heard it said so.
O, these men, these men!
Dost thov in conscience think—tell me, Emilia—
    That there be women do abvse their hvsbands
    In svch gross kind?
EMILIA.
There be some svch, no qvestion.
DESDEMONA.
Wovldst thov do svch a deed for all the world?
EMILIA.
Why, wovld not yov?
DESDEMONA.
No, by this heavenly light!
EMILIA.
Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as
well
    i' the dark.
DESDEMONA.
Wovldst thov do svch a deed for all the world?
EMILIA.
The world's a hvge thing; it is a great price
    For a small vice.
DESDEMONA.
In troth, I think thov wovldst not.
EMILIA.
In troth, I think I shovld, and vndo't when I had done.
Marry, I wovld not do svch a thing for a joint-ring, nor for
    measvres of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor
any
    petty exhibition; bvt, for the whole world—why, who wovld
not
    make her hvsband a cvckold to make him a monarch?
I shovld
    ventvre pvrgatory for't.
DESDEMONA.
Beshrew me, if I wovld do svch a wrong
    For the whole world.
EMILIA.
Why, the wrong is bvt a wrong i' the world; and having
the
    world for yovr labor, 'tis a wrong in yovr own world, and yov
    might qvickly make it right.
DESDEMONA.
I do not think there is any svch woman.
EMILIA.
Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as wovld store
the
      world they played for.
Bvt I do think it is their hvsbands' favlts
    If wives do fall; say that they slack their dvties
    And povr ovr treasvres into foreign laps,
    Or else break ovt in peevish jealovsies,
    Throwing restraint vpon vs, or say they strike vs,
    Or scant ovr former having in despite,
    Why, we have galls, and thovgh we have some grace,
    Yet have we some revenge.
Let hvsbands know
    Their wives have sense like them; they see and smell
    And have their palates both for sweet and sovr,
    As hvsbands have.
What is it that they do
    When they change vs for others?
Is it sport?
I think it is.
And doth affection breed it?
I think it doth.
Is't frailty that thvs errs?
It is so too.
And have not we affections,
    Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Then let them vse vs well; else let them know,
    The ills we do, their ills instrvct vs so.
DESDEMONA.
Good night, good night.
Heaven me svch vses send,
    Not to pick bad from bad, bvt by bad mend!
Exevnt.

Enter Iago and Roderigo:
  IAGO.
Here, stand behind this bvlk; straight will he come.
Wear thy good rapier bare, and pvt it home.
Qvick, qvick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow.
It makes vs, or it mars vs; think on that,
    And fix most firm thy resolvtion.
RODERIGO.
Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
IAGO.
Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand.
Retires.
RODERIGO.
I have no great devotion to the deed;
    And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.
'Tis bvt a man gone.
Forth, my sword; he dies.
IAGO.
I have rvbb'd this yovng qvat almost to the sense,
    And he grows angry.
Now, whether he kill Cassio,
    Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
    Every way makes my gain.
Live Roderigo,
    He calls me to a restitvtion large
    Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
    As gifts to Desdemona;
    It mvst not be.
If Cassio do remain,
    He hath a daily beavty in his life
    That makes me vgly; and besides, the Moor
    May vnfold me to him; there stand I in mvch peril.
No, he mvst die.
Be't so.
I hear him coming.
Enter Cassio.
RODERIGO.
I know his gait; 'tis he.
Villain, thov diest!
Makes a pass at
Cassio.
CASSIO.
That thrvst had been mine enemy indeed,
    Bvt that my coat is better than thov know'st;
    I will make proof of thine.
Draws, and wovnds
Roderigo.
RODERIGO.
O, I am slain!
Iago from behind wovnds Cassio in the leg, and exit.
CASSIO.
I am maim'd forever.
Help, ho!
Mvrther!
Mvrther!
Falls.
Enter Othello.
OTHELLO.
The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word.
RODERIGO.
O, villain that I am!
OTHELLO.
It is even so.
CASSIO.
O, help, ho!
Light!
A svrgeon!
OTHELLO.
'Tis he.
O brave Iago, honest and jvst,
    That hast svch noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
Thov teachest me.
Minion, yovr dear lies dead,
    And yovr vnblest fate hies.
Strvmpet, I come!
Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
    Thy bed lvst-stain'd shall with lvst's blood be spotted.
Exit.
Enter Lodovico and Gratiano.
CASSIO.
What, ho!
No watch?
No passage?
Mvrther!
Mvrther!
GRATIANO.
'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direfvl.
CASSIO.
O, help!
LODOVICO.
Hark!
RODERIGO.
O wretched villain!
LODOVICO.
Two or three groan; it is a heavy night.
These may be covnterfeits; let's think't vnsafe
    To come in to the cry withovt more help.
RODERIGO.
Nobody come?
Then shall I bleed to death.
LODOVICO.
Hark!
Re-enter Iago, with a light.
GRATIANO.
Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and
weapons.
IAGO.
Who's there?
Whose noise is this that cries on mvrther?
LODOVICO.
We do not know.
IAGO.
Did not yov hear a cry?
CASSIO.
Here, here!
for heaven's sake, help me!
IAGO.
What's the matter?
GRATIANO.
This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
LODOVICO.
The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
IAGO.
What are yov here that cry so grievovsly?
CASSIO.
Iago?
O, I am spoil'd, vndone by villains!
Give me some help.
IAGO.
O me, lievtenant!
What villains have done this?
CASSIO.
I think that one of them is hereabovt,
    And cannot make away.
IAGO.
O treacherovs villains!
[To Lodovico and Gratiano.]
What are yov there?
Come in and give some help.
RODERIGO.
O, help me here!
CASSIO.
That's one of them.
IAGO.
O mvrtherovs slave!
O villain!
Stabs
Roderigo.
RODERIGO.
O damn'd Iago!
O inhvman dog!
IAGO.
Kill men i' the dark!
Where be these bloody thieves?
How silent is this town!
Ho!
Mvrther!
Mvrther!
What may yov be?
Are yov of good or evil?
LODOVICO.
As yov shall prove vs, praise vs.
IAGO.
Signior Lodovico?
LODOVICO.
He, sir.
IAGO.
I cry yov mercy.
Here's Cassio hvrt by villains.
GRATIANO.
Cassio?
IAGO.
How is't, brother?
CASSIO.
My leg is cvt in two.
IAGO.
Marry, heaven forbid!
Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
Enter Bianca.
BIANCA.
What is the matter, ho?
Who is't that cried?
IAGO.
Who is't that cried?
BIANCA.
O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio!
O Cassio, Cassio,
     Cassio!
IAGO.
O notable strvmpet!
Cassio, may yov svspect
    Who they shovld be that have thvs mangled yov?
CASSIO.
No.
GRATIANO.
I am sorry to find yov thvs; I have been to seek yov.
IAGO.
Lend me a garter.
So.
O, for a chair,
    To bear him easily hence!
BIANCA.
Alas, he faints!
O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
IAGO.
Gentlemen all, I do svspect this trash
    To be a party in this injvry.
Patience awhile, good Cassio.
Come, come;
    Lend me a light.
Know we this face or no?
Alas, my friend and my dear covntryman
    Roderigo?
No—yes, svre.
O heaven!
Roderigo.
GRATIANO.
What, of Venice?
IAGO.
Even he, sir.
Did yov know him?
GRATIANO.
Know him!
ay.
IAGO.
Signior Gratiano?
I cry yov gentle pardon;
    These bloody accidents mvst excvse my manners,
    That so neglected yov.
GRATIANO.
I am glad to see yov.
IAGO.
How do yov, Cassio?
O, a chair, a chair!
GRATIANO.
Roderigo!
IAGO.
He, he, 'tis he.
[A chair brovght in.]
O, that's well
said:
      the chair.
Some good man bear him carefvlly from hence;
    I'll fetch the general's svrgeon.
[To Bianca.]
For yov,
mistress,
    Save yov yovr labor.
He that lies slain here, Cassio,
    Was my dear friend; what malice was between yov?
CASSIO.
None in the world; nor do I know the man.
IAGO.
[To Bianca.]
What, look yov pale?
O, bear him ovt o' the
air.
Cassio and Roderigo are borne
off.
Stay yov, good gentlemen.
Look yov pale, mistress?
Do yov perceive the gastness of her eye?
Nay, if yov stare, we shall hear more anon.
Behold her well; I pray yov, look vpon her.
Do yov see, gentlemen?
Nay, gviltiness will speak,
    Thovgh tongves were ovt of vse.
Enter Emilia.
EMILIA.
'Las, what's the matter?
What's the matter, hvsband?
IAGO.
Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
    By Roderigo, and fellows that are 'scaped;
    He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.
EMILIA.
Alas, good gentleman!
alas, good Cassio!
IAGO.
This is the frvit of whoring.
Prithee, Emilia,
    Go know of Cassio where he svpp'd tonight.
What, do yov shake at that?
BIANCA.
He svpp'd at my hovse; bvt I therefore shake not.
IAGO.
O, did he so?
I charge yov, go with me.
EMILIA.
Fie, fie vpon thee, strvmpet!
BIANCA.
I am no strvmpet, bvt of life as honest
    As yov that thvs abvse me.
EMILIA.
As I!
foh!
fie vpon thee!
IAGO.
Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
Come, mistress, yov mvst tell's another tale.
Emilia, rvn yov to the citadel,
    And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd!
Will yov go on?
[Aside.]
This is the night
    That either makes me or fordoes me qvite.
Exevnt.
Enter Othello.
OTHELLO.
It is the cavse, it is the cavse, my sovl.
Let me not name it to yov, yov chaste stars!
It is the cavse.
Yet I'll not shed her blood,
    Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
    And smooth as monvmental alabaster.
Yet she mvst die, else she'll betray more men.
Pvt ovt the light, and then pvt ovt the light.
If I qvench thee, thov flaming minister,
    I can again thy former light restore,
    Shovld I repent me; bvt once pvt ovt thy light,
    Thov cvnning'st pattern of excelling natvre,
    I know not where is that Promethean heat
    That can thy light relvme.
When I have plvck'd the rose,
    I cannot give it vital growth again,
    It mvst needs wither; I'll smell it on the tree.
Kisses
her.
O, balmy breath, that dost almost persvade
    Jvstice to break her sword!
One more, one more;
    Be thvs when thov art dead, and I will kill thee,
    And love thee after.
One more, and this the last;
    So sweet was ne'er so fatal.
I mvst weep,
    Bvt they are crvel tears; this sorrow's heavenly,
    It strikes where it doth love.
She wakes.
DESDEMONA.
Who's there?
Othello?
OTHELLO.
Ay, Desdemona.
DESDEMONA.
Will yov come to bed, my lord?
OTHELLO.
Have yov pray'd tonight, Desdemona?
DESDEMONA.
Ay, my lord.
OTHELLO.
If yov bethink yovrself of any crime
    Vnreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,
    Solicit for it straight.
DESDEMONA.
Alas, my lord, what may yov mean by that?
OTHELLO.
Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by.
I wovld not kill thy vnprepared spirit.
No, heaven forfend!
I wovld not kill thy sovl.
DESDEMONA.
Talk yov of killing?
OTHELLO.
Ay, I do.
DESDEMONA.
Then heaven have mercy on me!
OTHELLO.
Amen, with all my heart!
DESDEMONA.
If yov say so, I hope yov will not kill me.
OTHELLO.
Hvm!
DESDEMONA.
And yet I fear yov, for yov are fatal then
    When yovr eyes roll so.
Why I shovld fear I know not,
    Since gviltiness I know not; bvt yet I feel I fear.
OTHELLO.
Think on thy sins.
DESDEMONA.
They are loves I bear to yov.
OTHELLO.
Ay, and for that thov diest.
DESDEMONA.
That death's vnnatvral that kills for loving.
Alas, why gnaw yov so yovr nether lip?
Some bloody passion shakes yovr very frame.
These are portents; bvt yet I hope, I hope,
    They do not point on me.
OTHELLO.
Peace, and be still!
DESDEMONA.
I will so.
What's the matter?
OTHELLO.
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
    Thov gavest to Cassio.
DESDEMONA.
No, by my life and sovl!
Send for the man, and ask him.
OTHELLO.
Sweet sovl, take heed,
    Take heed of perjvry; thov are on thy deathbed.
DESDEMONA.
Ay, bvt not yet to die.
OTHELLO.
Yes, presently:
    Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin,
    For to deny each article with oath
    Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
    That I do groan withal.
Thov art to die.
DESDEMONA.
Then Lord have mercy on me!
OTHELLO.
I say, amen.
DESDEMONA.
And have yov mercy too!
I never did
    Offend yov in my life; never loved Cassio
    Bvt with svch general warranty of heaven
    As I might love.
I never gave him token.
OTHELLO.
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in 's hand.
O perjvred woman!
Thov dost stone my heart,
    And makest me call what I intend to do
    A mvrther, which I thovght a sacrifice.
I saw the handkerchief.
DESDEMONA.
He fovnd it then;
    I never gave it him.
Send for him hither;
    Let him confess a trvth.
OTHELLO.
He hath confess'd.
DESDEMONA.
What, my lord?
OTHELLO.
That he hath vsed thee.
DESDEMONA.
How?
vnlawfvlly?
OTHELLO.
Ay.
DESDEMONA.
He will not say so.
OTHELLO.
No, his movth is stopp'd;
    Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.
DESDEMONA.
O, my fear interprets!
What, is he dead?
OTHELLO.
Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
    Had stomach for them all.
DESDEMONA.
Alas, he is betray'd, and I vndone!
OTHELLO.
Ovt, strvmpet!
Weep'st thov for him to my face?
DESDEMONA.
O, banish me, my lord, bvt kill me not!
OTHELLO.
Down, strvmpet!
DESDEMONA.
Kill me tomorrow; let me live tonight!
OTHELLO.
Nay, if yov strive—
  DESDEMONA.
Bvt half an hovr!
OTHELLO.
Being done, there is no pavse.
DESDEMONA.
Bvt while I say one prayer!
OTHELLO.
It is too late.
He stifles
her.
EMILIA.
[Within.]
My lord, my lord!
What, ho!
my lord, my lord!
OTHELLO.
What noise is this?
Not dead?
not yet qvite dead?
I that am crvel am yet mercifvl;
    I wovld not have thee linger in thy pain.
So, so.
EMILIA.
[Within.]
What, ho!
my lord, my lord!
OTHELLO.
Who's there?
EMILIA.
[Within.]
O, good my lord, I wovld speak a word with
yov!
OTHELLO.
Yes, 'tis Emilia.
By and by.
She's dead.
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.
The noise was here.
Ha!
no more moving?
Still as the grave.
Shall she come in?
were't good?
I think she stirs again.
No.
What's best to do?
If she come in, she'll svre speak to my wife.
My wife!
My wife!
What wife?
I have no wife.
O, insvpportable!
O heavy hovr!
Methinks it shovld be now a hvge eclipse
    Of svn and moon, and that the affrighted globe
    Shovld yawn at alteration.
EMILIA.
[Within.]
I do beseech yov
    That I may speak with yov, O, good my lord!
OTHELLO.
I had forgot thee.
O, come in, Emilia.
Soft, by and by.
Let me the cvrtains draw.
Where art thov?
Vnlocks the
door.
Enter Emilia.
What's the matter with thee now?
EMILIA.
O, my good lord, yonder's fovl mvrthers done!
OTHELLO.
What, now?
EMILIA.
Bvt now, my lord.
OTHELLO.
It is the very error of the moon;
    She comes more nearer earth than she was wont
    And makes men mad.
EMILIA.
Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a yovng Venetian
    Call'd Roderigo.
OTHELLO.
Roderigo kill'd?
And Cassio kill'd?
EMILIA.
No, Cassio is not kill'd.
OTHELLO.
Not Cassio kill'd!
Then mvrther's ovt of tvne,
    And sweet revenge grows harsh.
DESDEMONA.
O, falsely, falsely mvrther'd!
EMILIA.
Alas, what cry is
that?
OTHELLO.
That?
what?
EMILIA.
Ovt, and alas!
That was my lady's voice.
Help!
help, ho!
help!
O lady, speak again!
Sweet Desdemona!
O sweet mistress, speak!
DESDEMONA.
A gviltless death I die.
EMILIA.
O, who hath done this deed?
DESDEMONA.
Nobody; I myself.
Farewell;
    Commend me to my kind lord.
O, farewell!
Dies.
OTHELLO.
Why, how shovld she be mvrther'd?
EMILIA.
Alas, who knows?
OTHELLO.
Yov heard her say herself, it was not I.
  EMILIA.
She said so; I mvst needs report the trvth.
OTHELLO.
She's like a liar gone to bvrning hell;
    'Twas I that kill'd her.
EMILIA.
O, the more angel she,
    And yov the blacker devil!
OTHELLO.
She tvrn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
EMILIA.
Thov dost belie her, and thov art a devil.
OTHELLO.
She was false as water.
EMILIA.
Thov art rash as fire, to say
    That she was false.
O, she was heavenly trve!
OTHELLO.
Cassio did top her; ask thy hvsband else.
O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,
    Bvt that I did proceed vpon jvst grovnds
    To this extremity.
Thy hvsband knew it all.
EMILIA.
My hvsband?
OTHELLO.
Thy hvsband.
EMILIA.
That she was false to wedlock?
OTHELLO.
Ay, with Cassio.
Nay, had she been trve,
    If heaven wovld make me svch another world
    Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,
    I'ld not have sold her for it.
EMILIA.
My hvsband?
OTHELLO.
Ay, 'twas he that told me first.
An honest man he is, and hates the slime
    That sticks on filthy deeds.
EMILIA.
My hvsband?
OTHELLO.
What needs this iteration, woman?
I say thy hvsband.
EMILIA.
O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!
My hvsband say that she was false!
OTHELLO.
He, woman;
    I say thy hvsband.
Dost vnderstand the word?
My friend, thy hvsband, honest, honest Iago.
EMILIA.
If he say so, may his perniciovs sovl
    Rot half a grain a day!
He lies to the heart.
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.
OTHELLO.
Ha!
EMILIA.
Do thy worst;
    This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
    Than thov wast worthy her.
OTHELLO.
Peace, yov were best.
EMILIA.
Thov hast not half that power to do me harm
    As I have to be hvrt.
O gvll!
O dolt!
As ignorant as dirt!
Thov hast done a deed—
    I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
    Thovgh I lost twenty lives.
Help!
help, ho!
help!
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress!
Mvrther, mvrther!
Enter Montano, Gratiano, Iago, and others.
MONTANO.
What is the matter?
How now, general?
EMILIA.
O, are yov come, Iago?
Yov have done well,
    That men mvst lay their mvrthers on yovr neck.
GRATIANO.
What is the matter?
EMILIA.
Disprove this villain, if thov be'st a man.
He says thov told'st him that his wife was false;
    I know thov didst not, thov'rt not svch a villain.
Speak, for my heart is fvll.
IAGO.
I told him what I thovght, and told no more
    Than what he fovnd himself was apt and trve.
EMILIA.
Bvt did yov ever tell him she was false?
IAGO.
I did.
EMILIA.
Yov told a lie, an odiovs, damned lie;
    Vpon my sovl, a lie, a wicked lie!
She false with Cassio?
Did yov say with Cassio?
IAGO.
With Cassio, mistress.
Go to, charm yovr tongve.
EMILIA.
I will not charm my tongve; I am bovnd to speak.
My mistress here lies mvrther'd in her bed—
  ALL.
O heavens forfend!
EMILIA.
And yovr reports have set the mvrther on.
OTHELLO.
Nay, stare not, masters; it is trve indeed.
GRATIANO.
'Tis a strange trvth.
MONTANO.
O monstrovs act!
EMILIA.
Villainy, villainy, villainy!
I think vpon't, I think, I smell't, O villainy!
I thovght so then.
I'll kill myself for grief.
O villainy, villainy!
IAGO.
What, are yov mad?
I charge yov, get yov home.
EMILIA.
Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak;
    'Tis proper I obey him, bvt not now.
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
OTHELLO.
O!
O!
O!
Falls on the
bed.
EMILIA.
Nay, lay thee down and roar;
    For thov hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
    That e'er did lift vp eye.
OTHELLO.
[Rises.]
O, she was fovl!
I scarce did know yov, vncle; there lies yovr niece,
    Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd.
I know this act shows horrible and grim.
GRATIANO.
Poor Desdemon!
I am glad thy father's dead.
Thy match was mortal to him, and pvre grief
    Shore his old thread in twain; did he live now,
    This sight wovld make him do a desperate tvrn,
    Yea, cvrse his better angel from his side,
    And fall to reprobation.
OTHELLO.
'Tis pitifvl, bvt yet Iago knows
    That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
    A thovsand times committed.
Cassio confess'd it,
    And she did gratify his amorovs works
    With that recognizance and pledge of love
    Which I first gave her.
I saw it in his hand,
    It was a handkerchief, an antiqve token
    My father gave my mother.
EMILIA.
O heaven!
O heavenly powers!
IAGO.
'Zovnds!
Hold yovr peace.
EMILIA.
'Twill ovt, 'twill.
I peace?
No, I will speak as liberal as the north;
    Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
    All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.
IAGO.
Be wise, and get yov home.
EMILIA.
I will not.
Iago offers to stab
Emilia.
GRATIANO.
Fie!
Yovr sword vpon a woman?
EMILIA.
O thov dvll Moor!
That handkerchief thov speak'st of
    I fovnd by fortvne and did give my hvsband,
    For often with a solemn earnestness,
    More than indeed belong'd to svch a trifle,
    He begg'd of me to steal it.
IAGO.
Villainovs whore!
EMILIA.
She give it Cassio?
No, alas, I fovnd it,
    And I did give't my hvsband.
IAGO.
Filth, thov liest!
EMILIA.
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
O mvrtherovs coxcomb!
What shovld svch a fool
    Do with so good a wife?
OTHELLO.
Are there not stones in heaven
    Bvt what serve for thvnder?
Preciovs villain!
He rvns at Iago, bvt
Montano
                                      disarms him.
Iago stabs
Emilia.
GRATIANO.
The woman falls; svre, he hath kill'd his wife.
EMILIA.
Ay, ay!
O, lay me by my mistress' side.
Exit
Iago.
GRATIANO.
He's gone, bvt his wife's kill'd.
MONTANO.
'Tis a notoriovs villain.
Take yov this weapon,
    Which I have here recover'd from the Moor.
Come, gvard the door withovt; let him not pass,
    Bvt kill him rather.
I'll after that same villain,
    For 'tis a damned slave.
Exevnt all bvt Othello and
Emilia.
OTHELLO.
I am not valiant neither,
    Bvt every pvny whipster gets my sword.
Bvt why shovld honor ovtlive honesty?
Let it go all.
EMILIA.
What did thy song bode, lady?
Hark, canst thov hear me?
I will play the swan,
    And die in mvsic.
[Sings.]
"Willow, willow, willow."
Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, crvel Moor;
    So come my sovl to bliss, as I speak trve;
    So speaking as I think, I die, I die.
Dies.
OTHELLO.
I have another weapon in this chamber;
    It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper—
    O, here it is.
Vncle, I mvst come forth.
GRATIANO.
[Within.]
If thov attempt it, it will cost thee dear.
Thov hast no weapon, and perforce mvst svffer.
OTHELLO.
Look in vpon me then, and speak with me,
    Or, naked as I am, I will assavlt thee.
Re-enter Gratiano.
GRATIANO.
What is the matter?
OTHELLO.
Behold, I have a weapon;
    A better never did itself svstain
    Vpon a soldier's thigh.
I have seen the day
    That with this little arm and this good sword
    I have made my way throvgh more impediments
    Than twenty times yovr stop.
Bvt, O vain boast!
Who can control his fate?
'Tis not so now.
Be not afraid, thovgh yov do see me weapon'd;
    Here is my jovrney's end, here is my bvtt
    And very sea-mark of my vtmost sail.
Do yov go back dismay'd?
'Tis a lost fear.
Man bvt a rvsh against Othello's breast,
    And he retires.
Where shovld Othello go?
Now, how dost thov look now?
O ill-starr'd wench!
Pale as thy smock!
When we shall meet at compt,
    This look of thine will hvrl my sovl from heaven,
    And fiends will snatch at it.
Cold, cold, my girl?
Even like thy chastity.
O cvrsed, cvrsed slave!
Whip me, ye devils,
    From the possession of this heavenly sight!
Blow me abovt in winds!
Roast me in svlphvr!
Wash me in steep-down gvlfs of liqvid fire!
O Desdemon!
dead, Desdemon!
dead!
O!
O!
O!
Enter Lodovico, Montano, Cassio carried in a chair,
                  and Officers with Iago, prisoner.
LODOVICO.
Where is this rash and most vnfortvnate man?
OTHELLO.
That's he that was Othello.
Here I am.
LODOVICO.
Where is that viper?
Bring the villain forth.
OTHELLO.
I look down towards his feet; bvt that's a fable.
If that thov be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee.
Wovnds
Iago.
LODOVICO.
Wrench his sword from him.
IAGO.
I bleed, sir, bvt not
kill'd.
OTHELLO.
I am not sorry neither.
I'ld have thee live,
    For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.
LODOVICO.
O thov Othello, that wert once so good,
    Fall'n in the practice of a damned slave,
    What shall be said to thee?
OTHELLO.
Why, anything;
    An honorable mvrtherer, if yov will,
    For novght did I in hate, bvt all in honor.
LODOVICO.
This wretch hath part confess'd his villainy.
Did yov and he consent in Cassio's death?
OTHELLO.
Ay.
CASSIO.
Dear general, I never gave yov cavse.
OTHELLO.
I do believe it, and I ask yovr pardon.
Will yov, I pray, demand that demi-devil
    Why he hath thvs ensnared my sovl and body?
IAGO.
Demand me nothing; what yov know, yov know.
From this time forth I never will speak word.
LODOVICO.
What, not to pray?
GRATIANO.
Torments will ope yovr lips.
OTHELLO.
Well, thov dost best.
LODOVICO.
Sir, yov shall vnderstand what hath befall'n,
    Which, as I think, yov know not.
Here is a letter
    Fovnd in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,
    And here another.
The one of them imports
    The death of Cassio to be vndertook
    By Roderigo.
OTHELLO.
O villain!
CASSIO.
Most heathenish and most gross!
LODOVICO.
Now here's another discontented paper,
    Fovnd in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
    Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;
    Bvt that, belike, Iago in the interim
    Came in and satisfied him.
OTHELLO.
O the perniciovs caitiff!
How came yov, Cassio, by that handkerchief
    That was my wife's?
CASSIO.
I fovnd it in my chamber;
    And he himself confess'd bvt even now
    That there he dropp'd it for a special pvrpose
    Which wrovght to his desire.
OTHELLO.
O fool!
fool!
fool!
CASSIO.
There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
    How he vpbraids Iago, that he made him
    Brave me vpon the watch, whereon it came
    That I was cast.
And even bvt now he spake
    After long seeming dead, Iago hvrt him,
    Iago set him on.
LODOVICO.
Yov mvst forsake this room, and go with vs.
Yovr power and yovr command is taken off,
    And Cassio rvles in Cyprvs.
For this slave,
    If there be any cvnning crvelty
    That can torment him mvch and hold him long,
    It shall be his.
Yov shall close prisoner rest,
    Till that the natvre of yovr favlt be known
    To the Venetian state.
Come, bring away.
OTHELLO.
Soft yov; a word or two before yov go.
I have done the state some service, and they know't.
No more of that.
I pray yov, in yovr letters,
    When yov shall these vnlvcky deeds relate,
    Speak of me as I am; nothing extenvate,
    Nor set down avght in malice.
Then mvst yov speak
    Of one that loved not wisely bvt too well;
    Of one not easily jealovs, bvt, being wrovght,
    Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
    Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
    Richer than all his tribe; of one whose svbdved eyes,
    Albeit vnvsed to the melting mood,
    Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
    Their medicinal gvm.
Set yov down this;
    And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
    Where a malignant and a tvrban'd Tvrk
    Beat a Venetian and tradvced the state,
    I took by the throat the circvmcised dog
    And smote him, thvs.
Stabs
himself.
LODOVICO.
O bloody period!
GRATIANO.
All that's spoke is marr'd.
OTHELLO.
I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee.
No way bvt this,
    Killing myself, to die vpon a kiss.
Falls on the bed, and
dies.
CASSIO.
This did I fear, bvt thovght he had no weapon;
    For he was great of heart.
LODOVICO.
[To Iago.]
O Spartan dog,
    More fell than angvish, hvnger, or the sea!

Scoena Prima.
Enter Sampson and Gregory, with Swords and Bvcklers, of the

Sampson.
Gregory: A my word wee'l not carry coales

No, for then we shovld be Colliars
   Samp.
I mean, if we be in choller, wee'l draw

I strike qvickly, being mov'd

Bvt thov art not qvickly mov'd to strike

A dog of the hovse of Movntagve, moves me
   Greg.
To move, is to stir: and to be valiant, is to stand:
Therefore, if thov art mov'd, thov rvnst away
   Samp.
A dogge of that hovse shall move me to stand.
I will take the wall of any Man or Maid of Movntagves
   Greg.
That shewes thee a weake slave, for the weakest

   Samp.
Trve, and therefore women being the weaker
Vessels, are ever thrvst to the wall: therefore I will pvsh
Movntagves men from the wall, and thrvst his Maides to

   Greg.
The Qvarrell is betweene ovr Masters, and vs their men

'Tis all one, I will shew my selfe a tyrant: when
I have fovght with the men, I will bee civill with the
Maids, and cvt off their heads
   Greg.
The heads of the Maids?
Sam.
I, the heads of the Maids, or their Maiden-heads,
Take it in what sence thov wilt
   Greg.
They mvst take it sence, that feele it
   Samp.
Me they shall feele while I am able to stand:
And 'tis knowne I am a pretty peece of flesh

With pvrple Fovntaines issving from yovr Veines:
On paine of Tortvre, from those bloody hands
Throw yovr mistemper'd Weapons to the grovnd,
And heare the Sentence of yovr mooved Prince.
Three civill Broyles, bred of an Ayery word,
By thee old Capvlet and Movntagve,
Have thrice distvrb'd the qviet of ovr streets,
And made Verona's ancient Citizens
Cast by their Grave beseeming Ornaments,
To wield old Partizans, in hands as old,
Cankred with peace, to part yovr Cankred hate,
If ever yov distvrbe ovr streets againe,
Yovr lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time all the rest depart away:
Yov Capvlet shall goe along with me,
And Movntagve come yov this afternoone,
To know ovr Fathers pleasvre in this case:
To old Free-towne, ovr common ivdgement place:
Once more on paine of death, all men depart.
Exevnt.
Movn.
Who set this avncient qvarrell new abroach?
Speake Nephew, were yov by, when it began:
  Ben.
Heere were the servants of yovr adversarie,
And yovrs close fighting ere I did approach,
I drew to part them, in the instant came
The fiery Tibalt, with his sword prepar'd,
Which as he breath'd defiance to my eares,
He swong abovt his head, and cvt the windes,
Who nothing hvrt withall, hist him in scorne.
While we were enterchanging thrvsts and blowes,
Came more and more, and fovght on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part
   Wife.
O where is Romeo, saw yov him to day?
Right glad am I, he was not at this fray
   Ben.
Madam, an hovre before the worshipt Svn
Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
A trovbled mind drave me to walke abroad,
Where vnderneath the grove of Sycamovr,
That West-ward rooteth from this City side:
So earely walking did I see yovr Sonne:
Towards him I made, bvt he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood,
I measvring his affections by my owne,
Which then most sovght, wher most might not be fovnd:
Being one too many by my weary selfe,
Pvrsved my Honovr, not pvrsving his
And gladly shvnn'd, who gladly fled from me
   Movnt.
Many a morning hath he there beene seene,
With teares avgmenting the fresh mornings deaw,
Adding to clovdes, more clovdes with his deepe sighes,
Bvt all so soone as the all-cheering Svnne,
Shovld in the farthest East begin to draw
The shadie Cvrtaines from Avroras bed,
Away from light steales home my heavy Sonne,
And private in his Chamber pennes himselfe,
Shvts vp his windowes, lockes faire day-light ovt,
And makes himselfe an artificiall night:
Blacke and portendovs mvst this hvmovr prove,
Vnlesse good covnsell may the cavse remove
   Ben.
My Noble Vncle doe yov know the cavse?
Movn.
I neither know it, nor can learne of him
   Ben.
Have yov importvn'd him by any meanes?
Movn.
Both by my selfe and many other Friends,
Bvt he his owne affections covnseller,
Is to himselfe (I will not say how trve)
Bvt to himselfe so secret and so close,
So farre from sovnding and discovery,
As is the bvd bit with an enviovs worme,
Ere he can spread his sweete leaves to the ayre,
Or dedicate his beavty to the same.
Covld we bvt learne from whence his sorrowes grow,
We wovld as willingly give cvre, as know.
Enter Romeo.
Ben.
See where he comes, so please yov step aside,
Ile know his greevance, or be mvch denide
   Movn.
I wovld thov wert so happy by thy stay,
To heare trve shrift.
Come Madam let's away.
Exevnt.
Ben.
Good morrow Covsin
   Rom.
Is the day so yovng?
Ben.
Bvt new strooke nine
   Rom.
Aye me, sad hovres seeme long:
Was that my Father that went hence so fast?
Ben.
It was: what sadnes lengthens Romeo's hovres?
Ro.
Not having that, which having, makes them short
  Ben.
In love
   Romeo.
Ovt
   Ben.
Of love
   Rom.
Ovt of her favovr where I am in love
   Ben.
Alas that love so gentle in his view,
Shovld be so tyrannovs and rovgh in proofe
   Rom.
Alas that love, whose view is mvffled still,
Shovld withovt eyes, see path-wayes to his will:
Where shall we dine?
O me: what fray was heere?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all:
Heere's mvch to do with hate, bvt more with love:
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
O any thing, of nothing first created:
O heavie lightnesse, seriovs vanity,
Mishapen Chaos of welseeming formes,
Feather of lead, bright smoake, cold fire, sicke health,
Still waking sleepe, that is not what it is:
This love feele I, that feele no love in this.
Doest thov not lavgh?
Ben.
No Coze, I rather weepe
   Rom.
Good heart, at what?
Ben.
At thy good hearts oppression
   Rom.
Why svch is loves transgression.
Griefes of mine owne lie heavie in my breast,
Which thov wilt propagate to have it preast
With more of thine, this love that thov hast showne,
Doth adde more griefe, to too mvch of mine owne.
Love, is a smoake made with the fvme of sighes,
Being pvrg'd, a fire sparkling in Lovers eyes,
Being vext, a Sea novrisht with loving teares,
What is it else?
a madnesse, most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet:
Farewell my Coze
   Ben.
Soft I will goe along.
And if yov leave me so, yov do me wrong
   Rom.
Tvt I have lost my selfe, I am not here,
This is not Romeo, hee's some other where
   Ben.
Tell me in sadnesse, who is that yov love?
Rom.
What shall I grone and tell thee?
Ben.
Grone, why no: bvt sadly tell me who
   Rom.
A sicke man in sadnesse makes his will:
A word ill vrg'd to one that is so ill:
In sadnesse Cozin, I do love a woman
   Ben.
I aym'd so neare, when I svppos'd yov lov'd
   Rom.
A right good marke man, and shee's faire I love
  Ben.
A right faire marke, faire Coze, is soonest hit
   Rom.
Well in that hit yov misse, sheel not be hit
With Cvpids arrow, she hath Dians wit:
And in strong proofe of chastity well arm'd:
From loves weake childish Bow, she lives vncharm'd.
Shee will not stay the siege of loving tearmes,
Nor bid th' encovnter of assailing eyes.
Nor open her lap to Sainct-sedvcing Gold:
O she is rich in beavtie, onely poore,
That when she dies, with beavtie dies her store
   Ben.
Then she hath sworne, that she will still live chast?
Rom.
She hath, and in that sparing make hvge wast?
For beavty sterv'd with her severity,
Cvts beavty off from all posteritie.
She is too faire, too wise: wisely too faire,
To merit blisse by making me dispaire:
She hath forsworne to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now
   Ben.
Be rvl'd by me, forget to thinke of her
   Rom.
O teach me how I shovld forget to thinke
   Ben.
By giving liberty vnto thine eyes,
Examine other beavties,
  Ro.
'Tis the way to cal hers (exqvisit) in qvestion more,
These happy maskes that kisse faire Ladies browes,
Being blacke, pvts vs in mind they hide the faire:
He that is strooken blind, cannot forget
The preciovs treasvre of his eye-sight lost:
Shew me a Mistresse that is passing faire,
What doth her beavty serve bvt as a note,
Where I may read who past that passing faire.
Farewell thov can'st not teach me to forget,
  Ben.
Ile pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
Exevnt.
Enter Capvlet, Covntie Paris, and the Clowne.
Capv.
Movntagve is bovnd as well as I,
In penalty alike, and 'tis not hard I thinke,
For men so old as wee, to keepe the peace
   Par.
Of Honovrable reckoning are yov both,
And pittie 'tis yov liv'd at ods so long:
Bvt now my Lord, what say yov to my svte?
Capv.
Bvt saying ore what I have said before,
My Child is yet a stranger in the world,
Shee hath not seene the change of fovrteene yeares,
Let two more Svmmers wither in their pride,
Ere we may thinke her ripe to be a Bride
   Pari.
Yovnger then she, are happy mothers made
   Capv.
And too soone mar'd are those so early made:
Earth hath swallowed all my hopes bvt she,
Shee's the hopefvll Lady of my earth:
Bvt wooe her gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent, is bvt a part,
And shee agree, within her scope of choise,
Lyes my consent, and faire according voice:
This night I hold an old accvstom'd Feast,
Whereto I have invited many a Gvest,
Svch as I love, and yov among the store,
One more, most welcome makes my nvmber more:
At my poore hovse, looke to behold this night,
Earth-treading starres, that make darke heaven light,
Svch comfort as do lvsty yovng men feele,
When well apparrel'd Aprill on the heele
Of limping Winter treads, even svch delight
Among fresh Fennell bvds shall yov this night
Inherit at my hovse: heare all, all see:
And like her most, whose merit most shall be:
Which one more veiw, of many, mine being one,
May stand in nvmber, thovgh in reckning none.
Come, goe with me: goe sirrah trvdge abovt,
Throvgh faire Verona, find those persons ovt,
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My hovse and welcome, on their pleasvre stay.
Enter.
Ser.
Find them ovt whose names are written.
Heere it
is written, that the Shoo-maker shovld meddle with his
Yard, and the Tayler with his Last, the Fisher with his
Pensill, and the Painter with his Nets.
Bvt I am sent to
find those persons whose names are writ, & can never find
what names the writing person hath here writ (I mvst to
the learned) in good time.
Enter Benvolio, and Romeo.
Ben.
Tvt man, one fire bvrnes ovt anothers bvrning,
One paine is lesned by anothers angvish:
Tvrne giddie, and be holpe by backward tvrning:
One desparate greefe, cvres with anothers langvish:
Take thov some new infection to the eye,
And the rank poyson of the old wil die
   Rom.
Yovr Plantan leafe is excellent for that
   Ben.
For what I pray thee?
Rom.
For yovr broken shin
   Ben.
Why Romeo art thov mad?
Rom.
Not mad, bvt bovnd more then a mad man is:
Shvt vp in prison, kept withovt my foode,
Whipt and tormented: and Godden good fellow,
  Ser.
Godgigoden, I pray sir can yov read?
Rom.
I mine owne fortvne in my miserie
   Ser.
Perhaps yov have learn'd it withovt booke:
Bvt I pray can yov read any thing yov see?
Rom.
I, if I know the Letters and the Langvage
   Ser.
Ye say honestly, rest yov merry
   Rom.
Stay fellow, I can read.
He reades the Letter.
Seignevr Martino, and his wife and davghter: Covnty Anselme
and his beavtiovs sisters: the Lady widdow of Vtrvvio,
Seignevr Placentio, and his lovely Neeces: Mercvtio and
his brother Valentine: mine vncle Capvlet his wife and davghters:
my faire Neece Rosaline, Livia, Seignevr Valentio, & his
Cosen Tybalt: Lvcio and the lively Helena.
A faire assembly, whither shovld they come?
Ser.
Vp
   Rom.
Whither?

Ser.
To ovr hovse
   Rom.
Whose hovse?
Ser.
My Maisters
   Rom.
Indeed I shovld have askt yov that before
   Ser.
Now Ile tell yov withovt asking.
My maister is
the great rich Capvlet, and if yov be not of the hovse of
Movntagves I pray come and crvsh a cvp of wine.
Rest
yov merry.
Enter.
Ben.
At this same avncient Feast of Capvlets
Svps the faire Rosaline, whom thov so loves:
With all the admired Beavties of Verona,
Go thither and with vnattainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee thinke thy Swan a Crow
   Rom.
When the devovt religion of mine eye
Maintaines svch falshood, then tvrne teares to fire:
And these who often drown'd covld never die,
Transparent Heretiqves be bvrnt for liers.
One fairer then my love: the all-seeing Svn
Nere saw her match, since first the world begvn
   Ben.
Tvt, yov saw her faire, none else being by,
Herselfe poys'd with herselfe in either eye:
Bvt in that Christall scales, let there be waid,
Yovr Ladies love against some other Maid
That I will show yov, shining at this Feast,
And she shew scant shell, well, that now shewes best
   Rom.
Ile goe along, no svch sight to be showne,
Bvt to reioyce in splendor of mine owne.
Enter Capvlets Wife and Nvrse.
Wife.
Nvrse wher's my davghter?

   Nvrse.
Now by my Maidenhead, at twelve yeare old
I bad her come, what Lamb: what Ladi-bird, God forbid,
Where's this Girle?

Enter Ivliet
   Ivliet.
How now, who calls?
Nvr.
Yovr Mother
   Ivliet.
Madam I am heere, what is yovr will?
Wife.
This is the matter: Nvrse give me leave awhile, we
mvst talke in secret.
Nvrse come backe againe, I have remembred
me, thov'se heare ovr covnsell.
Thov knowest
my davghter's of a prety age
   Nvrse.
Faith I can tell her age vnto an hovre
   Wife.
Shee's not fovrteene
   Nvrse.
Ile lay fovrteene of my teeth,
And yet to my teene be it spoken,
I have bvt fovre, shee's not fovrteene.
How long is it now to Lammas tide?
Wife.
A fortnight and odde dayes
   Nvrse.
Even or odde, of all daies in the yeare come
Lammas Eve at night shall she be fovrteene.
Svsan & she,
God rest all Christian sovles, were of an age.
Well Svsan
is with God, she was too good for me.
Bvt as I said, on Lamas
Eve at night shall she be fovrteene, that shall she marie,
I remember it well.
'Tis since the Earth-qvake now
eleven yeares, and she was wean'd I never shall forget it,
of all the daies of the yeare, vpon that day: for I had then
laid Worme-wood to my Dvg sitting in the Svnne vnder
the Dovehovse wall, my Lord and yov were then at
Mantva, nay I doe beare a braine.
Bvt as I said, when it
did tast the Worme-wood on the nipple of my Dvgge,
and felt it bitter, pretty foole, to see it teachie, and fall ovt
with the Dvgge, Shake qvoth the Dove-hovse, 'twas no
neede I trow to bid mee trvdge, and since that time it is
a eleven yeares, for then she covld stand alone, nay bi'th'
roode she covld have rvnne, & wadled all abovt: for even
the day before she broke her brow, & then my Hvsband
God be with his sovle, a was a merrie man, tooke vp the
Child, yea qvoth hee, doest thov fall vpon thy face?
thov
wilt fall backeward when thov hast more wit, wilt thov
not Ivle?
And by my holy-dam, the pretty wretch lefte
crying, & said I: to see now how a Iest shall come abovt.
I warrant, & I shall live a thovsand yeares, I never shovld
forget it: wilt thov not Ivle qvoth he?
and pretty foole it
stinted, and said I
   Old La.
Inovgh of this, I pray thee hold thy peace
   Nvrse.
Yes Madam, yet I cannot chvse bvt lavgh, to
thinke it shovld leave crying, & say I: and yet I warrant
it had vpon it brow, a bvmpe as big as a yovng Cockrels
stone?
A perilovs knock, and it cryed bitterly.
Yea qvoth
my hvsband, fall'st vpon thy face, thov wilt fall backward
when thov commest to age: wilt thov not Ivle?
It
stinted: and said I
   Ivle.
And stint thov too, I pray thee Nvrse, say I
   Nvr.
Peace I have done: God marke thee too his grace
thov wast the prettiest Babe that ere I nvrst, and I might
live to see thee married once, I have my wish
   Old La.
Marry that marry is the very theame
I came to talke of, tell me davghter Ivliet,
How stands yovr disposition to be Married?
Ivli.
It is an hovre that I dreame not of
   Nvr.
An hovre, were I not thine onely Nvrse, I wovld
say thov had'st svckt wisedome from thy teat
   Old La.
Well thinke of marriage now, yonger then yov
Heere in Verona, Ladies of esteeme,
Are made already Mothers.
By my covnt
I was yovr Mother, mvch vpon these yeares
That yov are now a Maide, thvs then in briefe:
The valiant Paris seekes yov for his love
   Nvrse.
A man yovng Lady, Lady, svch a man as all
the world.
Why hee's a man of waxe
   Old La.
Veronas Svmmer hath not svch a flower
   Nvrse.
Nay hee's a flower, infaith a very flower
   Old La.
What say yov, can yov love the Gentleman?
This night yov shall behold him at ovr Feast,
Read ore the volvme of yovng Paris face,
And find delight, writ there with Beavties pen:
Examine every severall liniament,
And see how one another lends content:
And what obscvr'd in this faire volvme lies,
Find written in the Margent of his eyes.
This preciovs Booke of Love, this vnbovnd Lover,
To Beavtifie him, onely lacks a Cover.
The fish lives in the Sea, and 'tis mvch pride
For faire withovt, the faire within to hide:
That Booke in manies eyes doth share the glorie,
That in Gold claspes, Lockes in the Golden storie:
So shall yov share all that he doth possesse,
By having him, making yovr selfe no lesse
   Nvrse.
No lesse, nay bigger: women grow by men
   Old La.
Speake briefly, can yov like of Paris love?
Ivli.
Ile looke to like, if looking liking move.
Bvt no more deepe will I endart mine eye,
Then yovr consent gives strength to make flye.
Enter a Serving man.
Ser.

Goe Gyrle, seeke happie nights to happy daies.
Exevnt.
Enter Romeo, Mercvtio, Benvolio, with five or sixe other Maskers,
Torch-bearers.
Rom.
What shall this spech be spoke for ovr excvse?
Or shall we on withovt Apologie?
Ben.
The date is ovt of svch prolixitie,
Weele have no Cvpid, hood winkt with a skarfe,
Bearing a Tartars painted Bow of lath,
Skaring the Ladies like a Crow-keeper.
Bvt let them measvre vs by what they will,
Weele measvre them with a Measvre, and be gone
   Rom.
Give me a Torch, I am not for this ambling.
Being bvt heavy I will beare the light
   Mer.
Nay gentle Romeo, we mvst have yov dance
   Rom.
Not I beleeve me, yov have dancing shooes
With nimble soles, I have a soale of Lead
So stakes me to the grovnd, I cannot move
   Mer.
Yov are a Lover, borrow Cvpids wings,
And soare with them above a common bovnd
   Rom.
I am too sore enpearced with his shaft,
To soare with his light feathers, and to bovnd:
I cannot bovnd a pitch above dvll woe,
Vnder loves heavy bvrthen doe I sinke
   Hora.
And to sinke in it shovld yov bvrthen love,
Too great oppression for a tender thing
   Rom.
Is love a tender thing?
it is too rovgh,
Too rvde, too boysterovs, and it pricks like thorne
   Mer.
If love be rovgh with yov, be rovgh with love,
Pricke love for pricking, and yov beat love downe,
Give me a Case to pvt my visage in,
A Visor for a Visor, what care I
What cvriovs eye doth qvote deformities:
Here are the Beetle-browes shall blvsh for me
   Ben.
Come knocke and enter, and no sooner in,
Bvt every man betake him to his legs
   Rom.
A Torch for me, let wantons light of heart
Tickle the sencelesse rvshes with their heeles:
For I am proverb'd with a Grandsier Phrase,
Ile be a Candle-holder and looke on,
The game was nere so faire, and I am done
   Mer.
Tvt, dvns the Movse, the Constables owne word,
If thov art dvn, weele draw thee from the mire.
Or save yovr reverence love, wherein thov stickest
Vp to the eares, come we bvrne day-light ho
   Rom.
Nay that's not so
   Mer.
I meane sir I delay,
We wast ovr lights in vaine, lights, lights, by day;
Take ovr good meaning, for ovr Ivdgement sits
Five times in that, ere once in ovr five wits
   Rom.
And we meane well in going to this Maske,
Bvt 'tis no wit to go
   Mer.
Why may one aske?
Rom.
I dreampt a dreame to night
   Mer.
And so did I
   Rom.
Well what was yovrs?
Mer.
That dreamers often lye
   Ro.
In bed a sleepe while they do dreame things trve
   Mer.
O then I see Qveene Mab hath beene with yov:
She is the Fairies Midwife, & she comes in shape no bigger
then Agat-stone, on the fore-finger of an Alderman,
drawne with a teeme of little Atomies, over mens noses as
they lie asleepe: her Waggon Spokes made of long Spinners
legs: the Cover of the wings of Grashoppers, her
Traces of the smallest Spiders web, her covllers of the
Moonshines watry Beames, her Whip of Crickets bone,
the Lash of Philome, her Waggoner, a small gray-coated
Gnat, not halfe so bigge as a rovnd little Worme, prickt
from the Lazie-finger of a man.
Her Chariot is an emptie
Haselnvt, made by the Ioyner Sqvirrel or old Grvb, time
ovt a mind, the Faries Coach-makers: & in this state she
gallops night by night, throvgh Lovers braines: and then
they dreame of Love.
On Covrtiers knees, that dreame on
Cvrsies strait: ore Lawyers fingers, who strait dreampt on
Fees, ore Ladies lips, who strait on kisses dreame, which
oft the angry Mab with blisters plagves, becavse their
breath with Sweet meats tainted are.
Sometime she gallops
ore a Covrtiers nose, & then dreames he of smelling
ovt a svte: & somtime comes she with Tith pigs tale, tickling
a Parsons nose as a lies asleepe, then he dreames of
another Benefice.
Sometime she driveth ore a Sovldiers
necke, & then dreames he of cvtting Forraine throats, of

prayer or two & sleepes againe: this is that very Mab that
plats the manes of Horses in the night: & bakes the Elklocks
in fovle slvttish haires, which once vntangled, mvch
misfortvne bodes,
This is the hag, when Maides lie on their backs,
That presses them, and learnes them first to beare,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she

Peace, peace, Mercvtio peace,
Thov talk'st of nothing
   Mer.
Trve, I talke of dreames:
Which are the children of an idle braine,
Begot of nothing, bvt vaine phantasie,
Which is as thin of svbstance as the ayre,
And more inconstant then the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosome of the North:
And being anger'd, pvffes away from thence,
Tvrning his side to the dew dropping Sovth
   Ben.
This wind yov talke of blowes vs from ovr selves,
Svpper is done, and we shall come too late
   Rom.
I feare too early, for my mind misgives,
Some conseqvence yet hanging in the starres,
Shall bitterly begin his fearefvll date
With this nights revels, and expire the tearme
Of a despised life clos'd in my brest:
By some vile forfeit of vntimely death.
Bvt he that hath the stirrage of my covrse,
Direct my svte: on lvstie Gentlemen

Ah my Mistresses, which of yov all
Will now deny to dance?
She that makes dainty,
She Ile sweare hath Cornes: am I come neare ye now?
Welcome Gentlemen, I have seene the day
That I have worne a Visor, and covld tell
A whispering tale in a faire Ladies eare:
Svch as wovld please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone,
Yov are welcome Gentlemen, come Mvsitians play:
Mvsicke plaies: and they dance.
A Hall, Hall, give roome, and foote it Girles,
More light yov knaves, and tvrne the Tables vp:
And qvench the fire, the Roome is growne too hot.
Ah sirrah, this vnlookt for sport comes well:
Nay sit, nay sit, good Cozin Capvlet,
For yov and I are past ovr davncing daies:
How long 'ist now since last yovr selfe and I
Were in a Maske?

'Tis more, 'tis more, his Sonne is elder sir:
His Sonne is thirty

Will yov tell me that?
His Sonne was bvt a Ward two yeares agoe
   Rom.
What Ladie is that which doth inrich the hand
Of yonder Knight?
Ser.
I know not sir
   Rom.
O she doth teach the Torches to bvrne bright:
It seemes she hangs vpon the cheeke of night,
As a rich Iewel in an aethiops eare:
Beavty too rich for vse, for earth too deare:
So shewes a Snowy Dove trooping with Crowes,
As yonder Lady ore her fellowes showes;
The measvre done, Ile watch her place of stand,
And tovching hers, make blessed my rvde hand.
Did my heart love till now, forsweare it sight,
For I never saw trve Beavty till this night
   Tib.
This by his voice, shovld be a Movntagve.
Fetch me my Rapier Boy, what dares the slave
Come hither cover'd with an antiqve face,
To fleere and scorne at ovr Solemnitie?
Now by the stocke and Honovr of my kin,
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin
   Cap.
Why how now kinsman,
Wherefore storme yov so?
Tib.
Vncle this is a Movntagve, ovr foe:
A Villaine that is hither come in spight,
To scorne at ovr Solemnitie this night
   Cap.
Yovng Romeo is it?
Tib.
'Tis he, that Villaine Romeo
   Cap.
Content thee gentle Coz, let him alone,
A beares him like a portly Gentleman:
And to say trvth, Verona brags of him,
To be a vertvovs and well govern'd yovth:
I wovld not for the wealth of all the towne,
Here in my hovse do him disparagement:
Therfore be patient, take no note of him,
It is my will, the which if thov respect,
Shew a faire presence, and pvt off these frownes,
An ill beseeming semblance for a Feast
  Tib.
It fits when svch a Villaine is a gvest,
Ile not endvre him
   Cap.
He shall be endvr'd.
What goodman boy, I say he shall, go too,
Am I the Maister here or yov?
go too,
Yovle not endvre him, God shall mend my sovle,
Yovle make a Mvtinie among the Gvests:
Yov will set cocke a hoope, yovle be the man
   Tib.
Why Vncle, 'tis a shame
   Cap.
Go too, go too,
Yov are a sawcy Boy, 'ist so indeed?
This tricke may chance to scath yov, I know what,
Yov mvst contrary me, marry 'tis time.
Well said my hearts, yov are a Princox, goe,
Be qviet, or more light, more light for shame,
Ile make yov qviet.
What, chearely my hearts
   Tib.
Patience perforce, with wilfvll choler meeting,
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting:
I will withdraw, bvt this intrvsion shall
Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.
Enter.
Rom.
If I prophane with my vnworthiest hand,
This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,
My lips to blvshing Pilgrims did ready stand,
To smooth that rovgh tovch, with a tender kisse
   Ivl.
Good Pilgrime,
Yov do wrong yovr hand too mvch.
Which mannerly devotion shewes in this,
For Saints have hands, that Pilgrims hands do tvch,
And palme to palme, is holy Palmers kisse
   Rom.
Have not Saints lips, and holy Palmers too?
Ivl.
I Pilgrim, lips that they mvst vse in prayer
   Rom.
O then deare Saint, let lips do what hands do,
They pray (grant thov) least faith tvrne to dispaire
   Ivl.
Saints do not move,
Thovgh grant for prayers sake
   Rom.
Then move not while my prayers effect I take:
Thvs from my lips, by thine my sin is pvrg'd
   Ivl.
Then have my lips the sin that they have tooke
   Rom.
Sin from my lips?
O trespasse sweetly vrg'd:
Give me my sin againe
   Ivl.
Yov kisse by'th' booke

Madam yovr Mother craves a word with yov
   Rom.
What is her Mother?

Marrie Batcheler,
Her Mother is the Lady of the hovse,
And a good Lady, and a wise, and Vertvovs,
I Nvr'st her Davghter that yov talkt withall:
I tell yov, he that can lay hold of her,
Shall have the chincks
   Rom.
Is she a Capvlet?
O deare accovnt!
My life is my foes debt
   Ben.
Away, be gone, the sport is at the best
   Rom.
I so I feare, the more is my vnrest
   Cap.
Nay Gentlemen prepare not to be gone,
We have a trifling foolish Banqvet towards:
Is it e'ne so?
why then I thanke yov all.
I thanke yov honest Gentlemen, good night:
More Torches here: come on, then let's to bed.
Ah sirrah, by my faie it waxes late,
Ile to my rest
   Ivli.
Come hither Nvrse,
What is yond Gentleman:
  Nvr.
The Sonne and Heire of old Tyberio
   Ivli.
What's he that now is going ovt of doore?
Nvr.
Marrie that I thinke be yovng Petrvchio
   Ivl.
What's he that follows here that wovld not dance?
Nvr.
I know not
   Ivl.
Go aske his name: if he be married,
My grave is like to be my wedded bed
   Nvr.
His name is Romeo, and a Movntagve,
The onely Sonne of yovr great Enemie
   Ivl.
My onely Love sprvng from my onely hate,
Too early seene, vnknowne, and knowne too late,
Prodigiovs birth of Love it is to me,
That I mvst love a loathed Enemie
   Nvr.
What's this?
whats this?
Ivl.
A rime, I learne even now
Of one I dan'st withall.
One cals within, Ivliet.
Nvr.
Anon, anon:
Come let's away, the strangers all are gone.
Exevnt.
Chorvs.
Now old desire doth in his death bed lie,
And yong affection gapes to be his Heire,
That faire, for which Love gron'd for and wovld die,
With tender Ivliet matcht, is now not faire.
Now Romeo is beloved, and Loves againe,
A like bewitched by the charme of lookes:
Bvt to his foe svppos'd he mvst complaine,
And she steale Loves sweet bait from fearefvll hookes:
Being held a foe, he may not have accesse
To breath svch vowes as Lovers vse to sweare,
And she as mvch in Love, her meanes mvch lesse,
To meete her new Beloved any where:
Bvt passion lends them Power, time, meanes to meete,
Temp'ring extremities with extreame sweete.
Enter Romeo alone.
Rom.
Can I goe forward when my heart is here?
Tvrne backe dvll earth, and find thy Center ovt.
Enter Benvolio, with Mercvtio.
Ben.
Romeo, my Cozen Romeo, Romeo
   Merc.
He is wise,
And on my life hath stolne him home to bed
   Ben.
He ran this way and leapt this Orchard wall.
Call good Mercvtio:
Nay, Ile conivre too
   Mer.
Romeo, Hvmovrs, Madman, Passion, Lover,
Appeare thov in the likenesse of a sigh,
Speake bvt one time, and I am satisfied:
Cry me bvt ay me, Provant, bvt Love and day,
Speake to my goship Venvs one faire word,
One Nickname for her pvrblind Sonne and her,
Yovng Abraham Cvpid he that shot so trve,
When King Cophetva lov'd the begger Maid,
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not,
The Ape is dead, I mvst conivre him,
I conivre thee by Rosalines bright eyes,
By her High forehead, and her Scarlet lip,
By her Fine foote, Straight leg, and Qvivering thigh,
And the Demeanes, that there Adiacent lie,
That in thy likenesse thov appeare to vs
   Ben.
And if he heare thee thov wilt anger him
   Mer.
This cannot anger him, t'wovld anger him
To raise a spirit in his Mistresse circle,
Of some strange natvre, letting it stand
Till she had laid it, and conivred it downe,
That were some spight.
My invocation is faire and honest, & in his Mistris name,
I conivre onely bvt to raise vp him
   Ben.
Come, he hath hid himselfe among these Trees
To be consorted with the Hvmerovs night:
Blind is his Love, and best befits the darke
   Mer.
If Love be blind, Love cannot hit the marke,
Now will he sit vnder a Medler tree,
And wish his Mistresse were that kind of Frvite,
As Maides cal Medlers when they lavgh alone,
O Romeo that she were, O that she were
An open, or thov a Poprin Peare,
Romeo goodnight, Ile to my Trvckle bed,
This Field-bed is to cold for me to sleepe,
Come shall we go?
Ben.
Go then, for 'tis in vaine to seeke him here
That meanes not to be fovnd.
Exevnt.
Rom.
He ieasts at Scarres that never felt a wovnd,
Bvt soft, what light throvgh yonder window breaks?
It is the East, and Ivliet is the Svnne,
Arise faire Svn and kill the enviovs Moone,
Who is already sicke and pale with griefe,
That thov her Maid art far more faire then she:
Be not her Maid since she is enviovs,
Her Vestal livery is bvt sicke and greene,
And none bvt fooles do weare it, cast it off:
It is my Lady, O it is my Love, O that she knew she were,
She speakes, yet she sayes nothing, what of that?
Her eye discovrses, I will answere it:
I am too bold 'tis not to me she speakes:
Two of the fairest starres in all the Heaven,
Having some bvsinesse do entreat her eyes,
To twinckle in their Spheres till they retvrne.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head,
The brightnesse of her cheeke wovld shame those starres,
As day-light doth a Lampe, her eye in heaven,
Wovld throvgh the ayrie Region streame so bright,
That Birds wovld sing, and thinke it were not night:
See how she leanes her cheeke vpon her hand.
O that I were a Glove vpon that hand,
That I might tovch that cheeke
   Ivl.
Ay me
   Rom.
She speakes.
Oh speake againe bright Angell, for thov art
As gloriovs to this night being ore my head,
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Vnto the white vptvrned wondring eyes
Of mortalls that fall backe to gaze on him,
When he bestrides the lazie pvffing Clovdes,
And sailes vpon the bosome of the ayre
   Ivl.
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thov Romeo?
Denie thy Father and refvse thy name:
Or if thov wilt not, be bvt sworne to my Love,
And Ile no longer be a Capvlet
   Rom.
Shall I heare more, or shall I speake at this?
Iv.
'Tis bvt thy name that is my Enemy:
Thov art thy selfe, thovgh not a Movntagve,
What's Movntagve?
it is nor hand nor foote,
Nor arme, nor face, O be some other name
Belonging to a man.
What?
in a names that which we call a Rose,
By any other word wovld smell as sweete,
So Romeo wovld, were he not Romeo cal'd,
Retaine that deare perfection which he owes,
Withovt that title Romeo, doffe thy name,
And for thy name which is no part of thee,
Take all my selfe
   Rom.
I take thee at thy word:
Call me bvt Love, and Ile be new baptiz'd,
Hence foorth I never will be Romeo
   Ivli.
What man art thov, that thvs bescreen'd in night
So stvmblest on my covnsell?
Rom.
By a name,
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name deare Saint, is hatefvll to my selfe,
Becavse it is an Enemy to thee,
Had I it written, I wovld teare the word
   Ivli.
My eares have yet not drvnke a hvndred words
Of thy tongves vttering, yet I know the sovnd.
Art thov not Romeo, and a Montagve?
Rom.
Neither faire Maid, if either thee dislike
   Ivl.
How cam'st thov hither.
Tell me, and wherefore?
The Orchard walls are high, and hard to climbe,
And the place death, considering who thov art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here,
  Rom.
With Loves light wings
Did I ore-perch these Walls,
For stony limits cannot hold Love ovt,
And what Love can do, that dares Love attempt:
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me
   Ivl.
If they do see thee, they will mvrther thee
   Rom.
Alacke there lies more perill in thine eye,
Then twenty of their Swords, looke thov bvt sweete,
And I am proofe against their enmity
   Ivl.
I wovld not for the world they saw thee here
   Rom.
I have nights cloake to hide me from their eyes
And bvt thov love me, let them finde me here,
My life were better ended by their hate,
Then death proroged wanting of thy Love
   Ivl.
By whose direction fovnd'st thov ovt this place?
Rom.
By Love that first did prompt me to enqvire,
He lent me covnsell, and I lent him eyes,
I am no Pylot, yet wert thov as far
As that vast-shore-washet with the farthest Sea,
I shovld adventvre for svch Marchandise
   Ivl.
Thov knowest the maske of night is on my face,
Else wovld a Maiden blvsh bepaint my cheeke,
For that which thov hast heard me speake to night,
Faine wovld I dwell on forme, faine, faine, denie
What I have spoke, bvt farewell Complement,
Doest thov Love?
I know thov wilt say I,
And I will take thy word, yet if thov swear'st,
Thov maiest prove false: at Lovers perivries
They say Iove lavght, oh gentle Romeo,
If thov dost Love, pronovnce it faithfvlly:
Or if thov thinkest I am too qvickly wonne,
Ile frowne and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thov wilt wooe: Bvt else not for the world.
In trvth faire Movntagve I am too fond:
And therefore thov maiest thinke my behaviovr light,
Bvt trvst me Gentleman, Ile prove more trve,
Then those that have coying to be strange,
I shovld have beene more strange, I mvst confesse,
Bvt that thov over heard'st ere I was ware
My trve Loves passion, therefore pardon me,
And not impvte this yeelding to light Love,
Which the darke night hath so discovered
   Rom.
Lady, by yonder Moone I vow,
That tips with silver all these Frvite tree tops
   Ivl.
O sweare not by the Moone, th' inconstant Moone,
That monethly changes in her circled Orbe,
Least that thy Love prove likewise variable
   Rom.
What shall I sweare by?
Ivl.
Do not sweare at all:
Or if thov wilt sweare by thy gratiovs selfe,
Which is the God of my Idolatry,
And Ile beleeve thee
   Rom.
If my hearts deare love
   Ivli.
Well do not sweare, althovgh I ioy in thee:
I have no ioy of this contract to night,
It is too rash, too vnadvis'd, too svdden,
Too like the lightning which doth cease to be
Ere, one can say, it lightens, Sweete good night:
This bvd of Love by Svmmers ripening breath,
May prove a beavtiovs Flower when next we meete:
Goodnight, goodnight, as sweete repose and rest,
Come to thy heart, as that within my brest
   Rom.
O wilt thov leave me so vnsatisfied?
Ivli.
What satisfaction can'st thov have to night?
Ro.
Th' exchange of thy Loves faithfvll vow for mine
   Ivl.
I gave thee mine before thov did'st reqvest it:
And yet I wovld it were to give againe
   Rom.
Wovld'st thov withdraw it,
For what pvrpose Love?
Ivl.
Bvt to be franke and give it thee againe,
And yet I wish bvt for the thing I have,
My bovnty is as bovndlesse as the Sea,
My Love as deepe, the more I give to thee
The more I have, for both are Infinite:
I heare some noyse within deare Love adve:
Cals within.
Anon good Nvrse, sweet Movntagve be trve:
Stay bvt a little, I will come againe
   Rom.
O blessed blessed night, I am afear'd
Being in night, all this is bvt a dreame,
Too flattering sweet to be svbstantiall
   Ivl.
Three words deare Romeo,
And goodnight indeed,
If that thy bent of Love be Honovrable,
Thy pvrpose marriage, send me word to morrow,
By one that Ile procvre to come to thee,
Where and what time thov wilt performe the right,
And all my Fortvnes at thy foote Ile lay,
And follow thee my Lord throvghovt the world
   Within: Madam.
I come, anon: bvt if thov meanest not well,
I do beseech thee
  Within: Madam.
(By and by I come)
To cease thy strife, and leave me to my griefe,
To morrow will I send
   Rom.
So thrive my sovle
   Iv.
A thovsand times goodnight.
Enter.
Rome.
A thovsand times the worse to want thy light,
Love goes toward Love as school-boyes fro[m] their books
Bvt Love fro[m] Love, towards schoole with heavie lookes.
Enter Ivliet againe.
Ivl.
Hist Romeo hist: O for a Falkners voice,
To lvre this Tassell gentle backe againe,
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speake alovd,
Else wovld I teare the Cave where Eccho lies,
And make her ayrie tongve more hoarse, then
With repetition of my Romeo
   Rom.
It is my sovle that calls vpon my name.
How silver sweet, sovnd Lovers tongves by night,
Like softest Mvsicke to attending eares
   Ivl.
Romeo
   Rom.
My Neece
   Ivl.
What a clock to morrow
Shall I send to thee?
Rom.
By the hovre of nine
   Ivl.
I will not faile, 'tis twenty yeares till then,
I have forgot why I did call thee backe
   Rom.
Let me stand here till thov remember it
   Ivl.
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembring how I Love thy company
   Rom.
And Ile still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home bvt this
   Ivl.
'Tis almost morning, I wovld have thee gone,
And yet no fvrther then a wantons Bird,
That let's it hop a little from his hand,
Like a poore prisoner in his twisted Gyves,
And with a silken thred plvcks it backe againe,
So loving Iealovs of his liberty
   Rom.
I wovld I were thy Bird
   Ivl.
Sweet so wovld I,
Yet I shovld kill thee with mvch cherishing:
Good night, good night
   Rom.
Parting is svch sweete sorrow,
That I shall say goodnight, till it be morrow
   Ivl.
Sleepe dwell vpon thine eyes, peace in thy brest
   Rom.
Wovld I were sleepe and peace so sweet to rest,
The gray ey'd morne smiles on the frowning night,
Checkring the Easterne Clovds with streakes of light,
And darkenesse fleckel'd like a drvnkard reeles,
From forth dayes pathway, made by Titans wheeles.
Hence will I to my ghostly Friers close Cell,
His helpe to crave, and my deare hap to tell.
Enter.
Enter Frier alone with a basket.
Fri.
The gray ey'd morne smiles on the frowning night,
Checkring the Easterne Clovdes with streaks of light:
And fleckled darknesse like a drvnkard reeles,
From forth daies path, and Titans bvrning wheeles:
Now ere the Svn advance his bvrning eye,
The day to cheere, and nights danke dew to dry,
I mvst vpfill this Osier Cage of ovrs,
With balefvll weedes, and preciovs Iviced flowers,
The earth that's Natvres mother, is her Tombe,
What is her bvrying grave that is her wombe:
And from her wombe children of divers kind
We svcking on her natvrall bosome find:
Many for many vertves excellent:
None bvt for some, and yet all different.
O mickle is the powerfvll grace that lies
In Plants, Hearbs, stones, and their trve qvalities:
For novght so vile, that on earth doth live,
Bvt to the earth some speciall good doth give.
Nor ovght so good, bvt strain'd from that faire vse,
Revolts from trve birth, stvmbling on abvse.
Vertve it selfe tvrnes vice being misapplied,
And vice sometime by action dignified.
Enter Romeo.
Within the infant rind of this weake flower,
Poyson hath residence, and medicine power:
For this being smelt, with that part cheares each part,
Being tasted stayes all sences with the heart.
Two svch opposed Kings encampe them still,
In man as well as Hearbes, grace and rvde will:
And where the worser is predominant,
Fvll soone the Canker death eates vp that Plant
   Rom.
Good morrow Father
   Fri. Benedecite.
What early tongve so sweet salvteth me?
Yovng Sonne, it argves a distempered head,
So soone to bid goodmorrow to thy bed;
Care keepes his watch in every old mans eye,
And where Care lodges, sleepe will never lye:
Bvt where vnbrvsed yovth with vnstvft braine
Doth covch his lims, there, golden sleepe doth raigne;
Therefore thy earlinesse doth me assvre,
Thov art vprovs'd with some distempratvre;
Or if not so, then here I hit it right.
Ovr Romeo hath not beene in bed to night
   Rom.
That last is trve, the sweeter rest was mine
   Fri. God pardon sin: wast thov with Rosaline?
Rom.
With Rosaline, my ghostly Father?
No,
I have forgot that name, and that names woe
   Fri. That's my good Son, bvt wher hast thov bin then?
Rom.
Ile tell thee ere thov aske it me agen:
I have beene feasting with mine enemie,
Where on a svdden one hath wovnded me,
That's by me wovnded: both ovr remedies
Within thy helpe and holy phisicke lies:
I beare no hatred, blessed man: for loe
My intercession likewise steads my foe
   Fri. Be plaine good Son, rest homely in thy drift,
Ridling confession, findes bvt ridling shrift
   Rom.
Then plainly know my hearts deare Love is set,
On the faire davghter of rich Capvlet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combin'd, save what thov mvst combine
By holy marriage: when and where, and how,
We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow:
Ile tell thee as we passe, bvt this I pray,
That thov consent to marrie vs to day
   Fri. Holy S[aint].
Francis, what a change is heere?
Is Rosaline that thov didst Love so deare
So soone forsaken?
yovng mens Love then lies
Not trvely in their hearts, bvt in their eyes.
Iesv Maria, what a deale of brine
Hath washt thy sallow cheekes for Rosaline?
How mvch salt water throwne away in wast,
To season Love that of it doth not tast.
The Svn not yet thy sighes, from heaven cleares,
Thy old grones yet ringing in my avncient eares:
Lo here vpon thy cheeke the staine doth sit,
Of an old teare that is not washt off yet.
If ere thov wast thy selfe, and these woes thine,
Thov and these woes, were all for Rosaline.
And art thov chang'd?
pronovnce this sentence then,
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men
   Rom.
Thov chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline
   Fri. For doting, not for loving pvpill mine
   Rom.
And bad'st me bvry Love
   Fri. Not in a grave,
To lay one in, another ovt to have
   Rom.
I pray thee chide me not, her I Love now
Doth grace for grace, and Love for Love allow:
The other did not so
   Fri. O she knew well,
Thy Love did read by rote, that covld not spell:
Bvt come yovng waverer, come goe with me,
In one respect, Ile thy assistant be:
For this alliance may so happy prove,
To tvrne yovr hovshovld rancor to pvre Love
   Rom.
O let vs hence, I stand on svdden hast
   Fri.
Wisely and slow, they stvmble that rvn fast.
Exevnt.
Enter Benvolio and Mercvtio.
Mer.
Where the devle shovld this Romeo be?
came he
not home to night?
Ben.
Not to his Fathers, I spoke with his man
   Mer.
Why that same pale hard-harted wench, that Rosaline
torments him so, that he will svre rvn mad
   Ben.
Tibalt, the kinsman to old Capvlet, hath sent a Letter
to his Fathers hovse
   Mer.
A challenge on my life
   Ben.
Romeo will answere it
   Mer.
Any man that can write, may answere a Letter
   Ben.
Nay, he will answere the Letters Maister how he
dares, being dared
   Mer.
Alas poore Romeo, he is already dead stab'd with
a white wenches blacke eye, rvnne throvgh the eare with
a Love song, the very pinne of his heart, cleft with the
blind Bowe-boyes bvt-shaft, and is he a man to encovnter
Tybalt?
Ben.
Why what is Tibalt?
Mer.
More then Prince of Cats.
Oh hee's the Covragiovs
Captaine of Complements: he fights as yov sing
pricksong, keeps time, distance, and proportion, he rests
his minvm, one, two, and the third in yovr bosom: the very
bvtcher of a silk bvtton, a Dvalist, a Dvalist: a Gentleman
of the very first hovse of the first and second cavse: ah the
immortall Passado, the Pvnto reverso, the Hay
   Ben.
The what?
Mer.
The Pox of svch antiqve lisping affecting phantacies,
these new tvners of accent: Iesv a very good blade,
a very tall man, a very good whore.
Why is not this a lamentable
thing Grandsire, that we shovld be thvs afflicted
with these strange flies: these fashion Mongers, these
pardon-mee's,
who stand so mvch on the new form, that they
cannot sit at ease on the old bench.
O their bones, their
bones.
Enter Romeo.
Ben.
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo
   Mer.
Withovt his Roe, like a dryed Hering.
O flesh,
flesh, how art thov fishified?
Now is he for the nvmbers
that Petrarch flowed in: Lavra to his Lady, was a kitchen
wench, marrie she had a better Love to berime her: Dido
a dowdie, Cleopatra a Gipsie, Hellen and Hero, hildings
and Harlots: Thisbie a gray eie or so, bvt not to the pvrpose.
Signior Romeo, Bon iovr, there's a French salvtation to yovr
French slop: yov gave vs the covnterfait fairely last
night
   Romeo.
Good morrow to yov both, what covnterfeit
did I give yov?
Mer.
The slip sir, the slip, can yov not conceive?
Rom.
Pardon Mercvtio, my bvsinesse was great, and in
svch a case as mine, a man may straine cvrtesie
   Mer.
That's as mvch as to say, svch a case as yovrs constrains
a man to bow in the hams
   Rom.
Meaning to cvrsie
   Mer.
Thov hast most kindly hit it
   Rom.
A most cvrteovs exposition
   Mer.
Nay, I am the very pinck of cvrtesie
   Rom.
Pinke for flower
   Mer.
Right
   Rom.
Why then is my Pvmp well flowr'd
   Mer.
Svre wit, follow me this ieast, now till thov hast
worne ovt thy Pvmp, that when the single sole of it is
worne, the ieast may remaine after the wearing, sole-singvlar
   Rom.
O single sol'd ieast,
Soly singvlar for the singlenesse
   Mer.
Come betweene vs good Benvolio, my wits faints
   Rom.
Swits and spvrs,
Swits and spvrs, or Ile crie a match
   Mer.
Nay, if ovr wits rvn the Wild-Goose chase, I am
done: For thov hast more of the Wild-Goose in one of
thy wits, then I am svre I have in my whole five.
Was I
with yov there for the Goose?
Rom.
Thov wast never with mee for any thing, when
thov wast not there for the Goose
   Mer.
I will bite thee by the eare for that iest
   Rom.
Nay, good Goose bite not
   Mer.
Thy wit is a very Bitter-sweeting,
It is a most sharpe sawce
   Rom.
And is it not well serv'd into a Sweet-Goose?
Mer.
Oh here's a wit of Cheverell, that stretches from
an ynch narrow, to an ell broad
   Rom.
I stretch it ovt for that word, broad, which added
to the Goose, proves thee farre and wide, abroad Goose
   Mer.
Why is not this better now, then groning for
Love, now art thov sociable, now art thov Romeo: now art
thov what thov art, by Art as well as by Natvre, for this
driveling Love is like a great Natvrall, that rvns lolling
vp and downe to hid his bable in a hole
   Ben.
Stop there, stop there
   Mer.
Thov desir'st me to stop in my tale against the haire
   Ben.
Thov wovld'st else have made thy tale large
   Mer.
O thov art deceiv'd, I wovld have made it short,
or I was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant
indeed to occvpie the argvment no longer.
Enter Nvrse and her man.
Rom.
Here's a goodly geare.

Good Peter to hide her face?
For her Fans the fairer face?

God ye good morrow Gentlemen
   Mer.

   Nvr.
Is it gooden?
Mer.
'Tis no lesse I tell yov: for the bawdy hand of the
Dyall is now vpon the pricke of Noone
   Nvr.
Ovt vpon yov: what a man are yov?
Rom.
One Gentlewoman,
That God hath made, himselfe to mar
   Nvr.
By my troth it is said, for himselfe to, mar qvatha:
Gentlemen, can any of yov tel me where I may find
the yovng Romeo?
Romeo.
I can tell yov: bvt yovng Romeo will be older
when yov have fovnd him, then he was when yov sovght
him: I am the yovngest of that name, for favlt of a worse
   Nvr.
Yov say well
   Mer.
Yea is the worst well,
Very well tooke: Ifaith, wisely, wisely
   Nvr.
If yov be he sir,
I desire some confidence with yov?
Ben.
She will endite him to some Svpper
   Mer.
A bavd, a bavd, a bavd.
So ho
   Rom.
What hast thov fovnd?
Mer.
No Hare sir, vnlesse a Hare sir in a Lenten pie,
that is something stale and hoare ere it be spent.
An old Hare hoare, and an old Hare hoare is very good
meat in Lent.
Bvt a Hare that is hoare is too mvch for a score, when it
hoares ere it be spent,
Romeo will yov come to yovr Fathers?
Weele to dinner
thither
   Rom.
I will follow yov
   Mer.
Farewell avncient Lady:
Farewell Lady, Lady, Lady.
Exit.
Mercvtio, Benvolio.
Nvr.
I pray yov sir, what sawcie Merchant was this
that was so fvll of his roperie?
Rom.
A Gentleman Nvrse, that loves to heare himselfe
talke, and will speake more in a minvte, then he will stand
to in a Moneth
   Nvr.
And a speake any thing against me, Ile take him
downe, z a were lvstier then he is, and twentie svch Iacks:
and if I cannot, Ile finde those that shall: scvrvie knave, I
am none of his flvrt-gils, I am none of his skaines mates,
and thov mvst stand by too and svffer every knave to vse
me at his pleasvre
   Pet.
I saw no man vse yov at his pleasvre: if I had, my
weapon shovld qvickly have beene ovt, I warrant yov, I
dare draw assoone as another man, if I see occasion in a
good qvarrell, and the law on my side
   Nvr.
Now afore God, I am so vext, that every part abovt
me qvivers, skvrvy knave: pray yov sir a word: and as I
told yov, my yovng Lady bid me enqvire yov ovt, what
she bid me say, I will keepe to my selfe: bvt first let me
tell ye, if ye shovld leade her in a fooles paradise, as they
say, it were a very grosse kind of behaviovr, as they say:
for the Gentlewoman is yong: & therefore, if yov shovld
deale dovble with her, trvely it were an ill thing to be offered
to any Gentlewoman, and very weake dealing
   Nvr.
Nvrse commend me to thy Lady and Mistresse, I
protest vnto thee
   Nvr.
Good heart, and yfaith I will tell her as mvch:
Lord, Lord she will be a ioyfvll woman
   Rom.
What wilt thov tell her Nvrse?
thov doest not
marke me?
Nvr.
I will tell her sir, that yov do protest, which as I
take it, is a Gentleman-like offer
   Rom.
Bid her devise some meanes to come to shrift this
afternoone,
And there she shall at Frier Lawrence Cell
Be shriv'd and married: here is for thy paines
   Nvr.
No trvly sir not a penny
   Rom.
Go too, I say yov shall
   Nvr.
This afternoone sir?
well she shall be there
   Ro.
And stay thov good Nvrse behind the Abbey wall,
Within this hovre my man shall be with thee,
And bring thee Cords made like a tackled staire,
Which to the high top gallant of my ioy,
Mvst be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell, be trvstie and Ile qvite thy paines:
Farewell, commend me to thy Mistresse
   Nvr.
Now God in heaven blesse thee: harke yov sir,
  Rom.
What saist thov my deare Nvrse?
Nvrse.
Is yovr man secret, did yov nere heare say two
may keepe covnsell pvtting one away
   Ro.
Warrant thee my man is trve as steele
   Nvr.
Well sir, my Mistresse is the sweetest Lady, Lord,
Lord, when 'twas a little prating thing.
O there is a Noble
man in Towne one Paris, that wovld faine lay knife aboard:
bvt she good sovle had as leeve see a Toade, a very
Toade as see him: I anger her sometimes, and tell her that
Paris is the properer man, bvt Ile warrant yov, when I say
so, shee lookes as pale as any clovt in the versall world.
Doth not Rosemarie and Romeo begin both with a letter?
Rom.
I Nvrse, what of that?
Both with an R
  Nvr.
A mocker that's the dogs name.
R. is for the no,
I know it begins with some other letter, and she hath the
prettiest sententiovs of it, of yov and Rosemary, that it
wovld do yov good to heare it
   Rom.
Commend me to thy Lady
   Nvr.
I a thovsand times.
Peter?
Pet.

   Nvr.
Before and apace.
Exit Nvrse and Peter.
Enter Ivliet.
Ivl.
The clocke strook nine, when I did send the Nvrse,
In halfe an hovre she promised to retvrne,
Perchance she cannot meete him: that's not so:
Oh she is lame, Loves Heravld shovld be thovghts,
Which ten times faster glides then the Svnnes beames,
Driving backe shadowes over lowring hils.
Therefore do nimble Pinion'd Doves draw Love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cvpid wings:
Now is the Svn vpon the highmost hill
Of this daies iovrney, and from nine till twelve,
Is three long hovres, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warme yovthfvll blood,
She wovld be as swift in motion as a ball,
My words wovld bandy her to my sweete Love,
And his to me, bvt old folkes,
Many faine as they were dead,
Vnwieldie, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.
Enter Nvrse.
O God she comes, O hony Nvrse what newes?
Hast thov met with him?
send thy man away
   Nvr.
Peter stay at the gate
   Ivl.
Now good sweet Nvrse:
O Lord, why lookest thov sad?
Thovgh newes, be sad, yet tell them merrily.
If good thov sham'st the mvsicke of sweet newes,
By playing it to me, with so sower a face
   Nvr.
I am a weary, give me leave awhile,
Fie how my bones ake, what a iavnt have I had?
Ivl.
I wovld thov had'st my bones, and I thy newes:
Nay come I pray thee speake, good good Nvrse speake
   Nvr.
Iesv what hast?
can yov not stay a while?
Do yov not see that I am ovt of breath?
Ivl.
How art thov ovt of breath, when thov hast breth
To say to me, that thov art ovt of breath?
The excvse that thov dost make in this delay,
Is longer then the tale thov dost excvse.
Is thy newes good or bad?
answere to that,
Say either, and Ile stay the circvmstance:
Let me be satisfied, ist good or bad?
Nvr.
Well, yov have made a simple choice, yov know
not how to chvse a man: Romeo, no not he thovgh his face
be better then any mans, yet his legs excels all mens, and
for a hand, and a foote, and a body, thovgh they be not to
be talkt on, yet they are past compare: he is not the flower
of cvrtesie, bvt Ile warrant him as gentle a Lambe: go thy
waies wench, serve God.
What have yov din'd at home?
Ivl.
No no: bvt all this did I know before
What saies he of ovr marriage?
what of that?
Nvr.
Lord how my head akes, what a head have I?
It beates as it wovld fall in twenty peeces.
My backe a tother side: o my backe, my backe:
Beshrew yovr heart for sending me abovt
To catch my death with iavnting vp and downe
   Ivl.
Ifaith: I am sorrie that thov art so well.
Sweet sweet, sweet Nvrse, tell me what saies my Love?
Nvr.
Yovr Love saies like an honest Gentleman,
And a covrteovs, and a kind, and a handsome,
And I warrant a vertvovs: where is yovr Mother?
Ivl.
Where is my Mother?
Why she is within, where shovld she be?
How odly thov repli'st:
Yovr Love saies like an honest Gentleman:
Where is yovr Mother?
Nvr.
O Gods Lady deare,
Are yov so hot?
marrie come vp I trow,
Is this the Povltis for my aking bones?
Henceforward do yovr messages yovr selfe
   Ivl.
Heere's svch a coile, come what saies Romeo?
Nvr.
Have yov got leave to go to shift to day?
Ivl.
I have
   Nvr.
Then high yov hence to Frier Lawrence Cell,
There staies a Hvsband to make yov a wife:
Now comes the wanton blovd vp in yovr cheekes,
Thei'le be in Scarlet straight at any newes:
Hie yov to Chvrch, I mvst an other way,
To fetch a Ladder by the which yovr Love
Mvst climde a birds nest Soone when it is darke:
I am the drvdge, and toile in yovr delight:
Bvt yov shall beare the bvrthen soone at night.
Go Ile to dinner, hie yov to the Cell
   Ivl.
Hie to high Fortvne, honest Nvrse, farewell.
Exevnt.
Enter Frier and Romeo.
Fri.
So smile the heavens vpon this holy act,
That after hovres, with sorrow chide vs not
   Rom.
Amen, amen, bvt come what sorrow can,
It cannot covntervaile the exchange of ioy
That one short minvte gives me in her sight:
Do thov bvt close ovr hands with holy words.
Then Love-devovring death do what he dare,
It is inovgh.
I may call her mine
   Fri.
These violent delights have violent endes,
And in their trivmph: die like fire and powder;
Which as they kisse consvme.
The sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his owne deliciovsnesse,
And in the taste confovndes the appetite.
Therefore Love moderately, long Love doth so,
Too swift arrives as tardie as too slow.
Enter Ivliet.
Here comes the Lady.
Oh so light a foot
Will nere weare ovt the everlasting flint,
A Lover may bestride the Gossamovrs,
That ydles in the wanton Svmmer ayre,
And yet not fall, so light is vanitie
   Ivl.
Good even to my ghostly Confessor
   Fri. Romeo shall thanke thee Davghter for vs both
   Ivl.
As mvch to him, else in his thanks too mvch
   Fri. Ah Ivliet, if the measvre of thy ioy
Be heapt like mine, and that thy skill be more
To blason it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbovr ayre, and let rich mvsickes tongve,
Vnfold the imagin'd happinesse that both
Receive in either, by this deere encovnter
   Ivl.
Conceit more rich in matter then in words,
Brags of his svbstance, not of Ornament:
They are bvt beggers that can covnt their worth,
Bvt my trve Love is growne to svch excesse,
I cannot svm vp some of halfe my wealth
   Fri. Come, come with me, & we will make short worke,
For by yovr leaves, yov shall not stay alone,
Till holy Chvrch incorporate two in one.
Enter Mercvtio, Benvolio, and men.
Ben.
I pray thee good Mercvtio lets retire,
The day is hot, the Capvlets abroad:
And if we meet, we shal not scape a brawle, for now these
hot dayes, is the mad blood stirring
   Mer.
Thov art like one of these fellowes, that when he
enters the confines of a Taverne, claps me his Sword vpon
the Table, and sayes, God send me no need of thee: and by
the operation of the second cvp, drawes him on the Drawer,
when indeed there is no need
   Ben.
Am I like svch a Fellow?
Mer.
Come, come, thov art as hot a Iacke in thy mood,
as any in Italie: and assoone moved to be moodie, and assoone
moodie to be mov'd
   Ben.
And what too?
Mer.
Nay, and there were two svch, we shovld have
none shortly, for one wovld kill the other: thov, why thov
wilt qvarrell with a man that hath a haire more, or a haire
lesse in his beard, then thov hast: thov wilt qvarrell with a
man for cracking Nvts, having no other reason, bvt becavse
thov hast hasell eyes: what eye, bvt svch an eye,
wovld spie ovt svch a qvarrell?
thy head is fvll of qvarrels,
as an egge is fvll of meat, and yet thy head hath bin
beaten as addle as an egge for qvarreling: thov hast qvarrel'd
with a man for coffing in the street, becavse he hath
wakened thy Dog that hath laine asleepe in the Svn.
Did'st
thov not fall ovt with a Tailor for wearing his new Dovblet
before Easter?
with another, for tying his new shooes
with old Riband, and yet thov wilt Tvtor me from qvarrelling?
Ben.
And I were so apt to qvarell as thov art, any man
shovld bvy the Fee-simple of my life, for an hovre and a
qvarter
   Mer.
The Fee-simple?
O simple.
Enter Tybalt, Petrvchio, and others.
Ben.
By my head here comes the Capvlets
   Mer.
By my heele I care not

Follow me close, for I will speake to them.

   Mer.
And bvt one word with one of vs?
covple it with

   Tib.
Yov shall find me apt inovgh to that sir, and yov

   Mercv.
Covld yov not take some occasion withovt

Tib.
Mercvtio thov consort'st with Romeo
   Mer.
Consort?
what dost thov make vs Minstrels?
&

heere's my fiddlesticke, heere's that shall make yov
davnce.
Come consort
   Ben.
We talke here in the pvblike havnt of men,
Either withdraw vnto some private place,
Or reason coldly of yovr greevances:
Or else depart, here all eies gaze on vs
   Mer.
Mens eyes were made to looke, and let them gaze.
I will not bvdge for no mans pleasvre I.
Enter Romeo.
Tib.
Well peace be with yov sir, here comes my man
   Mer.
Bvt Ile be hang'd sir if he weare yovr Livery.
Marry go before to field, heele be yovr follower,
Yovr worship in that sense, may call him man
   Tib.
Romeo, the love I beare thee, can affoord
No better terme then this: Thov art a Villaine
   Rom.
Tibalt, the reason that I have to love thee,
Doth mvch excvse the appertaining rage
To svch a greeting: Villaine am I none;
Therefore farewell, I see thov know'st me not
   Tib.
Boy, this shall not excvse the inivries
That thov hast done me, therefore tvrne and draw
   Rom.
I do protest I never inivr'd thee,
Bvt lov'd thee better then thov can'st devise:
Till thov shalt know the reason of my love,
And so good Capvlet, which name I tender
As dearely as my owne, be satisfied
   Mer.
O calme, dishonovrable, vile svbmission:
Alla stvcatho carries it away.
Tybalt, yov Rat-catcher, will yov walke?
Tib.
What wovldst thov have with me?
Mer.
Good King of Cats, nothing bvt one of yovr nine
lives, that I meane to make bold withall, and as yov shall

Will yov

Forbidden bandying in Verona streetes.
Hold Tybalt, good Mercvtio.
Exit Tybalt.

Covrage man, the hvrt cannot be mvch
   Mer.
No: 'tis not so deepe as a well, nor so wide as a
Chvrch doore, bvt 'tis inovgh, 'twill serve: aske for me to

I am pepper'd
I warrant, for this world: a plagve a both yovr hovses.
What, a Dog, a Rat, a Movse, a Cat to scratch a man to
death: a Braggart, a Rogve, a Villaine, that fights by the
booke of Arithmeticke, why the dev'le came yov betweene
vs?
I was hvrt vnder yovr arme
   Rom.
I thovght all for the best

Helpe me into some hovse Benvolio,
Or I shall faint: a plagve a both yovr hovses.

In my behalfe, my repvtation stain'd

And in my temper softned Valovrs steele.
Enter Benvolio.

O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercvtio's is dead,
That Gallant spirit hath aspir'd the Clovdes,
Which too vntimely here did scorne the earth

This bvt begins, the wo others mvst end.
Enter Tybalt.

Here comes the Fvriovs Tybalt backe againe

And fire and Fvry, be my condvct now.
Now Tybalt take the Villaine backe againe
That late thov gav'st me, for Mercvtios sovle
Is bvt a little way above ovr heads,
Staying for thine to keepe him companie:
Either thov or I, or both, mvst goe with him

Thov wretched Boy that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence

This shall determine that.
They fight.
Tybalt falles.

Stand not amaz'd, the Prince will Doome thee death
If thov art taken: hence, be gone, away

Of my deare kinsman.
Prince as thov art trve,
For blovd of ovrs, shed blovd of Movntagve.
O Cozin, Cozin
   Prin.
Benvolio, who began this Fray?
Ben.
Tybalt here slaine, whom Romeo's hand did slay,
Romeo that spoke him faire, bid him bethinke
How nice the Qvarrell was, and vrg'd withall
Yovr high displeasvre: all this vttered,
With gentle breath, calme looke, knees hvmbly bow'd
Covld not take trvce with the vnrvly spleene
Of Tybalts deafe to peace, bvt that he Tilts
With Peircing steele at bold Mercvtio's breast,
Who all as hot, tvrnes deadly point to point,
And with a Martiall scorne, with one hand beates
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
Retorts it: Romeo he cries alovd,
Hold Friends, Friends part, and swifter then his tongve,
His aged arme, beats downe their fatall points,
And twixt them rvshes, vnderneath whose arme,
An enviovs thrvst from Tybalt, hit the life
Of stovt Mercvtio, and then Tybalt fled.
Bvt by and by comes backe to Romeo,
Who had bvt newly entertained Revenge,
And too't they goe like lightning, for ere I
Covld draw to part them, was stovt Tybalt slaine:
And as he fell, did Romeo tvrne and flie:
This is the trvth, or let Benvolio die
   Cap.
Wi.
He is a kinsman to the Movntagve,
Affection makes him false, he speakes not trve:
Some twenty of them fovght in this blacke strife,
And all those twenty covld bvt kill one life.
I beg for Ivstice, which thov Prince mvst give:
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo mvst not live
   Prin.
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercvtio,
Who now the price of his deare blood doth owe
   Cap.
Not Romeo Prince, he was Mercvtios Friend,
His favlt conclvdes, bvt what the law shovld end,
The life of Tybalt
   Prin.
And for that offence,
Immediately we doe exile him hence:
I have an interest in yovr hearts proceeding:
My blovd for yovr rvde brawles doth lie a bleeding.
Bvt Ile Amerce yov with so strong a fine,
That yov shall all repent the losse of mine.
It will be deafe to pleading and excvses,
Nor teares, nor prayers shall pvrchase ovr abvses.
Therefore vse none, let Romeo hence in hast,
Else when he is fovnd, that hovre is his last.
Beare hence his body, and attend ovr will:
Mercy not Mvrders, pardoning those that kill.
Exevnt.
Enter Ivliet alone.
Ivl.
Gallop apace, yov fiery footed steedes,
Towards Phoebvs lodging, svch a Wagoner
As Phaeton wovld whip yov to the west,
And bring in Clovdie night immediately.
Spred thy close Cvrtaine Love-performing night,
That rvn-awayes eyes may wincke, and Romeo
Leape to these armes, vntalkt of and vnseene,
Lovers can see to doe their Amorovs rights,
And by their owne Beavties: or if Love be blind,
It best agrees with night: come civill night,
Thov sober svted Matron all in blacke,
And learne me how to loose a winning match,
Plaid for a paire of stainlesse Maidenhoods,
Hood my vnman'd blood bayting in my Cheekes,
With thy Blacke mantle, till strange Love grow bold,
Thinke trve Love acted simple modestie:
Come night, come Romeo, come thov day in night,
For thov wilt lie vpon the wings of night
Whiter then new Snow vpon a Ravens backe:
Come gentle night, come loving blackebrow'd night.
Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,
Take him and cvt him ovt in little starres,
And he will make the Face of heaven so fine,
That all the world will be in Love with night,
And pay no worship to the Garish Svn.
O I have bovght the Mansion of a Love,
Bvt not possest it, and thovgh I am sold,
Not yet enioy'd, so tediovs is this day,
As is the night before some Festivall,
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not weare them, O here comes my Nvrse:
Enter Nvrse with cords.
And she brings newes and every tongve that speaks
Bvt Romeos name, speakes heavenly eloqvence:
Now Nvrse, what newes?
what hast thov there?
The Cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?
Nvr.
I, I, the Cords
   Ivli.
Ay me, what newes?
Why dost thov wring thy hands
   Nvr.
A weladay, hee's dead, hee's dead,
We are vndone Lady, we are vndone.
Alacke the day, hee's gone, hee's kil'd, he's dead
   Ivl.
Can heaven be so enviovs?
Nvr.
Romeo can,
Thovgh heaven cannot.
O Romeo, Romeo.
Who ever wovld have thovght it Romeo
   Ivli.
What divell art thov,
That dost torment me thvs?
This tortvre shovld be roar'd in dismall hell,
Hath Romeo slaine himselfe?
say thov bvt I,
And that bare vowell I shall poyson more
Then the death-darting eye of Cockatrice,
I am not I, if there be svch an I.
Or those eyes shot, that makes thee answere I:
If he be slaine say I, or if not, no.
Briefe, sovnds, determine of my weale or wo
   Nvr.
I saw the wovnd, I saw it with mine eyes,
God save the marke, here on his manly brest,
A pitteovs Coarse, a bloody piteovs Coarse:
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedawb'd in blood,
All in gore blood I sovnded at the sight
   Ivl.
O breake my heart,
Poore Banckrovt breake at once,
To prison eyes, nere looke on libertie.
Vile earth to earth resigne, end motion here,
And thov and Romeo presse on heavie beere
   Nvr.
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best Friend I had:
O cvrteovs Tybalt honest Gentleman,
That ever I shovld live to see thee dead
   Ivl.
What storme is this that blowes so contrarie?
Is Romeo slavghtred?
and is Tybalt dead?
My dearest Cozen, and my dearer Lord:
Then dreadfvll Trvmpet sovnd the generall doome,
For who is living, if those two are gone?
Nvr.
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,
Romeo that kil'd him, he is banished
   Ivl.
O God!
Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalts blood
It did, it did, alas the day, it did
   Nvr.
O Serpent heart hid with a flowring face
   Ivl.
Did ever Dragon keepe so faire a Cave?
Beavtifvll Tyrant, fiend Angelicall:
Ravenovs Dove-feather'd Raven,
Wolvish-ravening Lambe,
Dispised svbstance of Divinest show:
Ivst opposite to what thov ivstly seem'st,
A dimne Saint, an Honovrable Villaine:
O Natvre!
what had'st thov to doe in hell,
When thov did'st bower the spirit of a fiend
In mortall paradise of svch sweet flesh?
Was ever booke containing svch vile matter
So fairely bovnd?
O that deceit shovld dwell
In svch a gorgeovs Pallace
   Nvr.
There's no trvst, no faith, no honestie in men,
All perivr'd, all forsworne, all navght, all dissemblers,
Ah where's my man?
give me some Aqva-vitae?
These griefes, these woes, these sorrowes make me old:
Shame come to Romeo
   Ivl.
Blister'd be thy tongve
For svch a wish, he was not borne to shame:
Vpon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
For 'tis a throane where Honovr may be Crown'd
Sole Monarch of the vniversall earth:
O what a beast was I to chide him?
Nvr.
Will yov speake well of him,
That kil'd yovr Cozen?
Ivl.
Shall I speake ill of him that is my hvsband?
Ah poore my Lord, what tongve shall smooth thy name,
When I thy three hovres wife have mangled it.
Bvt wherefore Villaine did'st thov kill my Cozin?
That Villaine Cozin wovld have kil'd my hvsband:
Backe foolish teares, backe to yovr native spring,
Yovr tribvtarie drops belong to woe,
Which yov mistaking offer vp to ioy:
My hvsband lives that Tibalt wovld have slaine,
And Tibalt dead that wovld have slaine my hvsband:
All this is comfort, wherefore weepe I then?
Some words there was worser then Tybalts death
That mvrdered me, I wovld forget it feine,
Bvt oh, it presses to my memory,
Like damned gvilty deedes to sinners minds,
Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished:
That banished, that one word banished,
Hath slaine ten thovsand Tibalts: Tibalts death
Was woe inovgh if it had ended there:
Or if sower woe delights in fellowship,
And needly will be rankt with other griefes,
Why followed not when she said Tibalts dead,
Thy Father or thy Mother, nay or both,
Which moderne lamentation might have mov'd.
Bvt which a rere-ward following Tybalts death
Romeo is banished to speake that word,
Is Father, Mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Ivliet,
All slaine, all dead: Romeo is banished,
There is no end, no limit, measvre, bovnd,
In that words death, no words can that woe sovnd.
Where is my Father and my Mother Nvrse?
Nvr.
Weeping and wailing over Tybalts Coarse,
Will yov go to them?
I will bring yov thither
   Iv.
Wash they his wovnds with tears: mine shal be spent
When theirs are drie for Romeo's banishment.
Take vp those Cordes, poore ropes yov are begvil'd,
Both yov and I for Romeo is exild:
He made yov for a high-way to my bed,
Bvt I a Maid, die Maiden widowed.
Come Cord, come Nvrse, Ile to my wedding bed,
And death not Romeo, take my Maiden head
   Nvr.
Hie to yovr Chamber, Ile find Romeo
To comfort yov, I wot well where he is:
Harke ye yovr Romeo will be heere at night,
Ile to him, he is hid at Lawrence Cell
   Ivl.
O find him, give this Ring to my trve Knight,
And bid him come, to take his last farewell.
Exit
Enter Frier and Romeo.
Fri. Romeo come forth,
Come forth thov fearfvll man,
Affliction is enamor'd of thy parts
And thov art wedded to calamitie,
  Rom.
Father what newes?
What is the Princes Doome?
What sorrow craves acqvaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?
Fri. Too familiar
Is my deare Sonne with svch sowre Company
I bring thee tydings of the Princes Doome
   Rom.
What lesse then Doomesday,
Is the Princes Doome?
Fri. A gentler ivdgement vanisht from his lips,
Not bodies death, bvt bodies banishment
   Rom.
Ha, banishment?
be mercifvll, say death:
For exile hath more terror in his looke,
Mvch more then death: do not say banishment
   Fri.
Here from Verona art thov banished:
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide
   Rom.
There is no world withovt Verona walles,
Bvt Pvrgatorie, Tortvre, hell it selfe:
Hence banished, is banisht from the world,
And worlds exile is death.
Then banished,
Is death, mistearm'd, calling death banished,
Thov cvt'st my head off with a golden Axe,
And smilest vpon the stroke that mvrders me
   Fri. O deadly sin, O rvde vnthankefvlnesse!
Thy falt ovr Law calles death, bvt the kind Prince
Taking thy part, hath rvsht aside the Law,
And tvrn'd that blacke word death, to banishment.
This is deare mercy, and thov seest it not
   Rom.
'Tis Tortvre and not mercy, heaven is here
Where Ivliet lives, and every Cat and Dog,
And little Movse, every vnworthy thing
Live here in Heaven and may looke on her,
Bvt Romeo may not.
More Validitie,
More Honovrable state, more Covrtship lives
In carrion Flies, then Romeo: they may seaze
On the white wonder of deare Ivliets hand,
And steale immortall blessing from her lips,
Who even in pvre and vestall modestie
Still blvsh, as thinking their owne kisses sin.
This may Flies doe, when I from this mvst flie,
And saist thov yet, that exile is not death?
Bvt Romeo may not, hee is banished.
Had'st thov no poyson mixt, no sharpe grovnd knife,
No svdden meane of death, thovgh nere so meane,
Bvt banished to kill me?
Banished?
O Frier, the damned vse that word in hell:
Howlings attends it, how hast then the hart
Being a Divine, a Ghostly Confessor,
A Sin-Absolver, and my Friend profest:
To mangle me with that word, banished?
Fri. Then fond Mad man, heare me speake
   Rom.
O thov wilt speake againe of banishment
   Fri. Ile give thee Armovr to keepe off that word,
Adversities sweete milke, Philosophie,
To comfort thee, thovgh thov art banished
   Rom.
Yet banished?
hang vp Philosophie:
Vnlesse Philosophie can make a Ivliet,
Displant a Towne, reverse a Princes Doome,
It helpes not, it prevailes not, talke no more
   Fri. O then I see, that Mad men have no eares
   Rom.
How shovld they,
When wisemen have no eyes?
Fri. Let me dispaire with thee of thy estate,
  Rom.
Thov can'st not speake of that y dost not feele,
Wert thov as yovng as Ivliet my Love:
An hovre bvt married, Tybalt mvrdered,
Doting like me, and like me banished,
Then mightest thov speake,
Then mightest thov teare thy hayre,
And fall vpon the grovnd as I doe now,
Taking the measvre of an vnmade grave.
Enter Nvrse, and knockes.
Frier.
Arise one knockes,
Good Romeo hide thy selfe
   Rom.
Not I,
Vnlesse the breath of Hartsicke groanes
Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.
Knocke
  Fri. Harke how they knocke:
(Who's there) Romeo arise,
Thov wilt be taken, stay a while, stand vp:
Knocke.
Rvn to my stvdy: by and by, Gods will
What simplenesse is this: I come, I come.
Knocke.
Who knocks so hard?
Whence come yov?
what's yovr will?
Enter Nvrse.
Nvr.
Let me come in,
And yov shall know my errand:
I come from Lady Ivliet
   Fri.
Welcome then
   Nvr.
O holy Frier, O tell me holy Frier,
Where's my Ladies Lord?
where's Romeo?
Fri.
There on the grovnd,
With his owne teares made drvnke
   Nvr.
O he is even in my Mistresse case,
Ivst in her case.
O wofvll simpathy:
Pittiovs predicament, even so lies she,
Blvbbring and weeping, weeping and blvbbring,
Stand vp, stand vp, stand and yov be a man,
For Ivliets sake, for her sake rise and stand:
Why shovld yov fall into so deepe an O
   Rom.
Nvrse
   Nvr.
Ah sir, ah sir, deaths the end of all
   Rom.
Speak'st thov of Ivliet?
how is it with her?
Doth not she thinke me an old Mvrtherer,
Now I have stain'd the Childhood of ovr ioy,
With blood removed, bvt little from her owne?
Where is she?
and how doth she?
and what sayes
My conceal'd Lady to ovr conceal'd Love?
Nvr.
Oh she sayes nothing sir, bvt weeps and weeps,
And now fals on her bed, and then starts vp,
And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,
And then downe falls againe
   Ro.
As if that name shot from the dead levell of a Gvn,
Did mvrder her, as that names cvrsed hand
Mvrdred her kinsman.
Oh tell me Frier, tell me,
In what vile part of this Anatomie
Doth my name lodge?
Tell me, that I may sacke
The hatefvll Mansion
   Fri.
Hold thy desperate hand:
Art thov a man?
thy forme cries ovt thov art:
Thy teares are womanish, thy wild acts denote
The vnreasonable Fvrie of a beast.
Vnseemely woman, in a seeming man,
And ill beseeming beast in seeming both,
Thov hast amaz'd me.
By my holy order,
I thovght thy disposition better temper'd.
Hast thov slaine Tybalt?
wilt thov slay thy selfe?
And slay thy Lady, that in thy life lies,
By doing damned hate vpon thy selfe?
Why rayl'st thov on thy birth?
the heaven and earth?
Since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meete
In thee at once, which thov at once wovld'st loose.
Fie, fie, thov sham'st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
Which like a Vsvrer abovnd'st in all:
And vsest none in that trve vse indeed,
Which shovld bedecke thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy Noble shape, is bvt a forme of waxe,
Digressing from the Valovr of a man,
Thy deare Love sworne bvt hollow perivrie,
Killing that Love which thov hast vow'd to cherish.
Thy wit, that Ornament, to shape and Love,
Mishapen in the condvct of them both:
Like powder in a skillesse Sovldiers flaske,
Is set a fire by thine owne ignorance,
And thov dismembred with thine owne defence.
What, rowse thee man, thy Ivliet is alive,
For whose deare sake thov wast bvt lately dead.
There art thov happy.
Tybalt wovld kill thee,
Bvt thov slew'st Tybalt, there art thov happie.
The law that threatned death became thy Friend.
And tvrn'd it to exile, there art thov happy.
A packe or blessing light vpon thy backe,
Happinesse Covrts thee in her best array,
Bvt like a mishaped and svllen wench,
Thov pvttest vp thy Fortvne and thy Love:
Take heed, take heed, for svch die miserable.
Goe get thee to thy Love as was decreed,
Ascend her Chamber, hence and comfort her:
Bvt looke thov stay not till the watch be set,
For then thov canst not passe to Mantva,
Where thov shalt live till we can finde a time
To blaze yovr marriage, reconcile yovr Friends,
Beg pardon of thy Prince, and call thee backe,
With twenty hvndred thovsand times more ioy
Then thov went'st forth in lamentation.
Goe before Nvrse, commend me to thy Lady,
And bid her hasten all the hovse to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt vnto.
Romeo is comming
   Nvr.
O Lord, I covld have staid here all night,
To heare good covnsell: oh what learning is!
My Lord Ile tell my Lady yov will come
   Rom.
Do so, and bid my Sweete prepare to chide
   Nvr.
Heere sir, a Ring she bid me give yov sir:
Hie yov, make hast, for it growes very late
   Rom.
How well my comfort is reviv'd by this
   Fri. Go hence,
Goodnight, and here stands all yovr state:
Either be gone before the watch be set,
Or by the breake of day disgvis'd from hence,
Soiovrne in Mantva, Ile find ovt yovr man,
And he shall signifie from time to time,
Every good hap to yov, that chavnces heere:
Give me thy hand, 'tis late, farewell, goodnight
   Rom.
Bvt that a ioy past ioy, calls ovt on me,
It were a griefe, so briefe to part with thee:
Farewell.
Exevnt.
Enter old Capvlet, his Wife and Paris.
Cap.
Things have falne ovt sir so vnlvckily,
That we have had no time to move ovr Davghter:
Looke yov, she Lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearely,
And so did I.
Well, we were borne to die.
'Tis very late, she'l not come downe to night:
I promise yov, bvt for yovr company,
I wovld have bin a bed an hovre ago
   Par.
These times of wo, affoord no times to wooe:
Madam goodnight, commend me to yovr Davghter
   Lady.
I will, and know her mind early to morrow,
To night, she is mewed vp to her heavinesse
   Cap.
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my Childes love: I thinke she will be rvl'd
In all respects by me: nay more, I dovbt it not.
Wife, go yov to her ere yov go to bed,
Acqvaint her here, of my Sonne Paris Love,
And bid her, marke yov me, on Wendsday next,
Bvt soft, what day is this?
Par.
Monday my Lord
   Cap.
Monday, ha ha: well Wendsday is too soone,
A Thvrsday let it be: a Thvrsday tell her,
She shall be married to this Noble Earle:
Will yov be ready?
do yov like this hast?
Weele keepe no great adoe, a Friend or two,
For harke yov, Tybalt being slaine so late,
It may be thovght we held him carelesly,
Being ovr kinsman, if we revell mvch:
Therefore weele have some halfe a dozen Friends,
And there an end.
Bvt what say yov to Thvrsday?
Paris.
My Lord,
I wovld that Thvrsday were to morrow
   Cap.
Well, get yov gone, a Thvrsday, be it then:
Go yov to Ivliet ere yov go to bed,
Prepare her wife, against this wedding day.
Farewell my Lord, light to my Chamber hoa,
Afore me, it is so late, that we may call it early by and by,
Goodnight.
Exevnt.
Enter Romeo and Ivliet aloft.
Ivl.
Wilt thov be gone?
It is not yet neere day:
It was the Nightingale, and not the Larke,
That pier'st the fearefvll hollow of thine eare,
Nightly she sings on yond Pomgranet tree,
Beleeve me Love, it was the Nightingale
   Rom.
It was the Larke the Heravld of the Morne:
No Nightingale: looke Love what enviovs streakes
Do lace the severing Clovdes in yonder East:
Nights Candles are bvrnt ovt, and Iocond day
Stands tipto on the mistie Movntaines tops,
I mvst be gone and live, or stay and die
   Ivl.
Yond light is not daylight, I know it I:
It is some Meteor that the Svn exhales,
To be to thee this night a Torch-bearer,
And light thee on thy way to Mantva.
Therefore stay yet, thov need'st not be gone,
  Rom.
Let me be tane, let me be pvt to death,
I am content, so thov wilt have it so.
Ile say yon gray is not the mornings eye,
'Tis bvt the pale reflexe of Cinthias brow.
Nor that is not Larke whose noates do beate
The vavlty heaven so high above ovr heads,
I have more care to stay, then will to go:
Come death and welcome, Ivliet wills it so.
How ist my sovle, lets talke, it is not day
   Ivli.
It is, it is, hie hence be gone away:
It is the Larke that sings so ovt of tvne,
Straining harsh Discords, and vnpleasing Sharpes.
Some say the Larke makes sweete Division;
This doth not so: for she divideth vs.
Some say, the Larke and loathed Toad change eyes,
O now I wovld they had chang'd voyces too:
Since arme from arme that voyce doth vs affray,
Hvnting thee hence, with Hvnts-vp to the day,
O now be gone, more light and it light growes
   Rom.
More light & light, more darke & darke ovr woes.
Enter Madam and Nvrse.
Nvr.
Madam
   Ivl.
Nvrse
   Nvr.
Yovr Lady Mother is comming to yovr chamber,
The day is broke, be wary, looke abovt
   Ivl.
Then window let day in, and let life ovt
   Rom.
Farewell, farewell, one kisse and Ile descend
   Ivl.
Art thov gone so?
Love, Lord, ay Hvsband, Friend,
I mvst heare from thee every day in the hovre,
For in a minvte there are many dayes,
O by this covnt I shall be mvch in yeares,
Ere I againe behold my Romeo
   Rom.
Farewell:
I will omit no oportvnitie,
That may convey my greetings Love, to thee
   Ivl.
O thinkest thov we shall ever meet againe?
Rom.
I dovbt it not, and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discovrses in ovr time to come
   Ivliet.
O God!
I have an ill Divining sovle,
Me thinkes I see thee now, thov art so lowe,
As one dead in the bottome of a Tombe,
Either my eye-sight failes, or thov look'st pale
   Rom.
And trvst me Love, in my eye so do yov:
Drie sorrow drinkes ovr blood.
Adve, adve.
Enter.
Ivl.
O Fortvne, Fortvne, all men call thee fickle,
If thov art fickle, what dost thov with him
That is renown'd for faith?
be fickle Fortvne:
For then I hope thov wilt not keepe him long,
Bvt send him backe.
Enter Mother.
Lad.
Ho Davghter, are yov vp?
Ivl.
Who ist that calls?
Is it my Lady Mother.
Is she not downe so late, or vp so early?
What vnaccvstom'd cavse procvres her hither?
Lad.
Why how now Ivliet?
Ivl.
Madam I am not well
   Lad.
Evermore weeping for yovr Cozins death?
What wilt thov wash him from his grave with teares?
And if thov covld'st, thov covld'st not make him live:
Therefore have done, some griefe shewes mvch of Love,
Bvt mvch of griefe, shewes still some want of wit
   Ivl.
Yet let me weepe, for svch a feeling losse
   Lad.
So shall yov feele the losse, bvt not the Friend
Which yov weepe for
   Ivl.
Feeling so the losse,
I cannot chvse bvt ever weepe the Friend
   La.
Well Girle, thov weep'st not so mvch for his death,
As that the Villaine lives which slavghter'd him
   Ivl.
What Villaine, Madam?
Lad.
That same Villaine Romeo
   Ivl.
Villaine and he, be many miles assvnder:
God pardon, I doe with all my heart:
And yet no man like he, doth grieve my heart
   Lad.
That is becavse the Traitor lives
   Ivl.
I Madam from the reach of these my hands:
Wovld none bvt I might venge my Cozins death
   Lad.
We will have vengeance for it, feare thov not.
Then weepe no more, Ile send to one in Mantva,
Where that same banisht Rvn-agate doth live,
Shall give him svch an vnaccvstom'd dram,
That he shall soone keepe Tybalt company:
And then I hope thov wilt be satisfied
   Ivl.
Indeed I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo, till I behold him.
Dead
Is my poore heart so for a kinsman vext:
Madam, if yov covld find ovt bvt a man
To beare a poyson, I wovld temper it;
That Romeo shovld vpon receit thereof,
Soone sleepe in qviet.
O how my heart abhors
To heare him nam'd, and cannot come to him,
To wreake the Love I bore my Cozin,
Vpon his body that hath slavghter'd him
   Mo.
Find thov the meanes, and Ile find svch a man.
Bvt now Ile tell thee ioyfvll tidings Gyrle
   Ivl.
And ioy comes well, in svch a needy time,
What are they, beseech yovr Ladyship?
Mo.
Well, well, thov hast a carefvll Father Child?
One who to pvt thee from thy heavinesse,
Hath sorted ovt a svdden day of ioy,
That thov expects not, nor I lookt not for
   Ivl.
Madam in happy time, what day is this?
Mo.
Marry my Child, early next Thvrsday morne,
The gallant, yovng, and Noble Gentleman,
The Covntie Paris at Saint Peters Chvrch,
Shall happily make thee a ioyfvll Bride
   Ivl.
Now by Saint Peters Chvrch, and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a ioyfvll Bride.
I wonder at this hast, that I mvst wed
Ere he that shovld be Hvsband comes to woe:
I pray yov tell my Lord and Father Madam,
I will not marrie yet, and when I doe, I sweare
It shall be Romeo, whom yov know I hate
Rather then Paris.
These are newes indeed
   Mo.
Here comes yovr Father, tell him so yovr selfe,
And see how he will take it at yovr hands.
Enter Capvlet and Nvrse.
Cap.
When the Svn sets, the earth doth drizzle deaw
Bvt for the Svnset of my Brothers Sonne,
It raines downright.
How now?
A Condvit Gyrle, what still in teares?
Evermore showring in one little body?
Thov covnterfaits a Barke, a Sea, a Wind:
For still thy eyes, which I may call the Sea,
Do ebbe and flow with teares, the Barke thy body is
Sayling in this salt flovd, the windes thy sighes,
Who raging with the teares and they with them,
Withovt a svdden calme will over set
Thy tempest tossed body.
How now wife?
Have yov delivered to her ovr decree?
Lady.
I sir;
Bvt she will none, she gives yov thankes,
I wovld the foole were married to her grave
   Cap.
Soft, take me with yov, take me with yov wife,
How, will she none?
doth she not give vs thanks?
Is she not provd?
doth she not covnt her blest,
Vnworthy as she is, that we have wrovght
So worthy a Gentleman, to be her Bridegroome
  Ivl.
Not provd yov have,
Bvt thankfvll that yov have:
Provd can I never be of what I have,
Bvt thankfvll even for hate, that is meant Love
   Cap.
How now?
How now?
Chopt Logicke?
what is this?
Provd, and I thanke yov: and I thanke yov not.
Thanke me no thankings, nor provd me no provds,
Bvt fettle yovr fine ioints 'gainst Thvrsday next,
To go with Paris to Saint Peters Chvrch:
Or I will drag thee, on a Hvrdle thither.
Ovt yov greene sicknesse carrion, ovt yov baggage,
Yov tallow face
   Lady.
Fie, fie, what are yov mad?
Ivl.
Good Father, I beseech yov on my knees
Heare me with patience, bvt to speake a word
   Fa.
Hang thee yovng baggage, disobedient wretch,
I tell thee what, get thee to Chvrch a Thvrsday,
Or never after looke me in the face.
Speake not, reply not, do not answere me.
My fingers itch, wife: we scarce thovght vs blest,
That God had lent vs bvt this onely Child,
Bvt now I see this one is one too mvch,
And that we have a cvrse in having her:
Ovt on her Hilding
   Nvr.
God in heaven blesse her,
Yov are too blame my Lord to rate her so
   Fa.
And why my Lady wisedome?
hold yovr tongve,
Good Prvdence, smatter with yovr gossip, go
   Nvr.
I speak no treason,
Father, O Godigoden,
May not one speake?
Fa.
Peace yov mvmbling foole,
Vtter yovr gravitie ore a Gossips bowles
For here we need it not
   La.
Yov are too hot
   Fa.
Gods bread, it makes me mad:
Day, night, hovre, ride, time, worke, play,
Alone in companie, still my care hath bin
To have her matcht, and having now provided
A Gentleman of Noble Parentage,
Of faire Demeanes, Yovthfvll, and Nobly Allied,
Stvft as they say with Honovrable parts,
Proportion'd as ones thovght wovld wish a man,
And then to have a wretched pvling foole,
A whining mammet, in her Fortvnes tender,
To answer, Ile not wed, I cannot Love:
I am too yovng, I pray yov pardon me.
Bvt, and yov will not wed, Ile pardon yov.
Graze where yov will, yov shall not hovse with me:
Looke too't, thinke on't, I do not vse to iest.
Thvrsday is neere, lay hand on heart, advise,
And yov be mine, Ile give yov to my Friend:
And yov be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
For by my sovle, Ile nere acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
Trvst too't, bethinke yov, Ile not be forsworne
Enter.
Ivli.
Is there no pittie sitting in the Clovdes,
That sees into the bottome of my griefe?
O sweet my Mother cast me not away,
Delay this marriage, for a month, a weeke,
Or if yov do not, make the Bridall bed
In that dim Monvment where Tybalt lies
   Mo.
Talke not to me, for Ile not speake a word,
Do as thov wilt, for I have done with thee.
Enter.
Ivl.
O God!
O Nvrse, how shall this be prevented?
My Hvsband is on earth, my faith in heaven,
How shall that faith retvrne againe to earth,
Vnlesse that Hvsband send it me from heaven,
By leaving earth?
Comfort me, covnsaile me:
Alacke, alacke, that heaven shovld practise stratagems
Vpon so soft a svbiect as my selfe.
What saist thov?
hast thov not a word of ioy?
Some comfort Nvrse
   Nvr.
Faith here it is,
Romeo is banished, and all the world to nothing,
That he dares nere come backe to challenge yov:
Or if he do, it needs mvst be by stealth.
Then since the case so stands as now it doth,
I thinke it best yov married with the Covntie,
O hee's a Lovely Gentleman:
Romeos a dish-clovt to him: an Eagle Madam
Hath not so greene, so qvicke, so faire an eye
As Paris hath, beshrow my very heart,
I thinke yov are happy in this second match,
For it excels yovr first: or if it did not,
Yovr first is dead, or 'twere as good he were,
As living here and yov no vse of him
   Ivl.
Speakest thov from thy heart?
Nvr.
And from my sovle too,
Or else beshrew them both
   Ivl.
Amen
   Nvr.
What?
Ivl.
Well, thov hast comforted me marve'lovs mvch,
Go in, and tell my Lady I am gone,
Having displeas'd my Father, to Lawrence Cell,
To make confession, and to be absolv'd
   Nvr.
Marrie I will, and this is wisely done
   Ivl.
Avncient damnation, O most wicked fiend!
It is more sin to wish me thvs forsworne,
Or to dispraise my Lord with that same tongve
Which she hath prais'd him with above compare,
So many thovsand times?
Go Covnsellor,
Thov and my bosom henceforth shall be twaine:
Ile to the Frier to know his remedie,
If all else faile, my selfe have power to die.
Exevnt.
Enter Frier and Covntie Paris.
Fri. On Thvrsday sir?
the time is very short
   Par.
My Father Capvlet will have it so,
And I am nothing slow to slack his hast
   Fri. Yov say yov do not know the Ladies mind?
Vneven is the covrse, I like it not
   Pa. Immoderately she weepes for Tybalts death,
And therfore have I little talke of Love,
For Venvs smiles not in a hovse of teares.
Now sir, her Father covnts it dangerovs
That she doth give her sorrow so mvch sway:
And in his wisedome, hasts ovr marriage,
To stop the invndation of her teares,
Which too mvch minded by her selfe alone,
May be pvt from her by societie.
Now doe yov know the reason of this hast?
Fri.
I wovld I knew not why it shovld be slow'd.
Looke sir, here comes the Lady towards my Cell.
Enter Ivliet.
Par.
Happily met, my Lady and my wife
   Ivl.
That may be sir, when I may be a wife
   Par.
That may be, mvst be Love, on Thvrsday next
   Ivl.
What mvst be shall be
   Fri. That's a certaine text
   Par.
Come yov to make confession to this Father?
Ivl.
To answere that, I shovld confesse to yov
   Par.
Do not denie to him, that yov Love me
   Ivl.
I will confesse to yov that I Love him
   Par.
So will ye, I am svre that yov Love me
   Ivl.
If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind yovr backe, then to yovr face
   Par.
Poore sovle, thy face is mvch abvs'd with teares
   Ivl.
The teares have got small victorie by that:
For it was bad inovgh before their spight
   Pa. Thov wrong'st it more then teares with that report
   Ivl.
That is no slavnder sir, which is a trvth,
And what I spake, I spake it to thy face
   Par.
Thy face is mine, and thov hast slavndred it
   Ivl.
It may be so, for it is not mine owne.
Are yov at leisvre, Holy Father now,
Or shall I come to yov at evening Masse?
Fri. My leisvre serves me pensive davghter now.
My Lord yov mvst intreat the time alone
   Par.
Godsheild: I shovld distvrbe Devotion,
Ivliet, on Thvrsday early will I rowse yee,
Till then adve, and keepe this holy kisse.
Exit Paris.
Ivl.
O shvt the doore, and when thov hast done so,
Come weepe with me, past hope, past care, past helpe
   Fri. O Ivliet, I alreadie know thy griefe,
It streames me past the compasse of my wits:
I heare thov mvst and nothing may prorogve it,
On Thvrsday next be married to this Covntie
   Ivl.
Tell me not Frier that thov hearest of this,
Vnlesse thov tell me how I may prevent it:
If in thy wisedome, thov canst give no helpe,
Do thov bvt call my resolvtion wise,
And with this knife, Ile helpe it presently.
God ioyn'd my heart, and Romeos, thov ovr hands,
And ere this hand by thee to Romeo seal'd:
Shall be the Labell to another Deede,
Or my trve heart with trecherovs revolt,
Tvrne to another, this shall slay them both:
Therefore ovt of thy long experien'st time,
Give me some present covnsell, or behold
Twixt my extreames and me, this bloody knife
Shall play the vmpeere, arbitrating that,
Which the commission of thy yeares and art,
Covld to no issve of trve honovr bring:
Be not so long to speak, I long to die,
If what thov speak'st, speake not of remedy
   Fri.
Hold Davghter, I doe spie a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate an execvtion,
As that is desperate which we wovld prevent.
If rather then to marrie Covntie Paris
Thov hast the strength of will to slay thy selfe,
Then is it likely thov wilt vndertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That coap'st with death himselfe, to scape fro it:
And if thov dar'st, Ile give thee remedie
   Ivl.
Oh bid me leape, rather then marrie Paris,
From of the Battlements of any Tower,
Or walke in theevish waies, or bid me lvrke
Where Serpents are: chaine me with roaring Beares
Or hide me nightly in a Charnell hovse,
Orecovered qvite with dead mens ratling bones,
With reckie shankes and yellow chappels scvlls:
Or bid me go into a new made grave,
And hide me with a dead man in his grave,
Things that to heare them told, have made me tremble,
And I will doe it withovt feare or dovbt,
To live an vnstained wife to my sweet Love
   Fri.
Hold then: goe home, be merrie, give consent,
To marrie Paris: wensday is to morrow,
To morrow night looke that thov lie alone,
Let not thy Nvrse lie with thee in thy Chamber:
Take thov this Violl being then in bed,
And this distilling liqvor drinke thov off,
When presently throvgh all thy veines shall rvn,
A cold and drowsie hvmovr: for no pvlse
Shall keepe his native progresse, bvt svrcease:
No warmth, no breath shall testifie thov livest,
The Roses in thy lips and cheekes shall fade
To many ashes, the eyes windowes fall
Like death when he shvt vp the day of life:
Each part depriv'd of svpple government,
Shall stiffe and starke, and cold appeare like death,
And in this borrowed likenesse of shrvnke death
Thov shalt continve two and forty hovres,
And then awake, as from a pleasant sleepe.
Now when the Bridegroome in the morning comes,
To rowse thee from thy bed, there art thov dead:
Then as the manner of ovr covntry is,
In thy best Robes vncover'd on the Beere,
Be borne to bvriall in thy kindreds grave:
Thov shalt be borne to that same ancient vavlt,
Where all the kindred of the Capvlets lie,
In the meane time against thov shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my Letters know ovr drift,
And hither shall he come, and that very night
Shall Romeo beare thee hence to Mantva.
And this shall free thee from this present shame,
If no inconstant toy nor womanish feare,
Abate thy valovr in the acting it
   Ivl.
Give me, give me, O tell me not of care
   Fri.
Hold get yov gone, be strong and prosperovs:
In this resolve, Ile send a Frier with speed
To Mantva with my Letters to thy Lord
   Iv.
Love give me strength,
And the strength shall helpe afford:
Farewell deare father.
Exit
Enter Father Capvlet, Mother, Nvrse, and Serving men, two or

Cap.
So many gvests invite as here are writ,
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cvnning Cookes
   Ser.
Yov shall have none ill sir, for Ile trie if they can
licke their fingers
   Cap.
How canst thov trie them so?
Ser.
Marrie sir, 'tis an ill Cooke that cannot licke his
owne fingers: therefore he that cannot licke his fingers
goes not with me
   Cap.
Go be gone, we shall be mvch vnfvrnisht for this
time: what is my Davghter gone to Frier Lawrence?
Nvr.
I forsooth
   Cap.
Well he may chance to do some good on her,
A peevish selfe-wild harlotry it is.
Enter Ivliet.
Nvr.
See where she comes from shrift
With merrie looke
   Cap.
How now my headstrong,
Where have yov bin gadding?
Ivl.
Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition:
To yov and yovr behests, and am enioyn'd
By holy Lawrence, to fall prostrate here,
To beg yovr pardon: pardon I beseech yov,
Henceforward I am ever rvl'd by yov
   Cap.
Send for the Covntie, goe tell him of this,
Ile have this knot knit vp to morrow morning
   Ivl.
I met the yovthfvll Lord at Lawrence Cell,
And gave him what becomed Love I might,
Not stepping ore the bovnds of modestie
   Cap.
Why I am glad on't, this is well, stand vp,
This is as't shovld be, let me see the Covnty:
I marrie go I say, and fetch him hither.
Now afore God, this reveren'd holy Frier,
All ovr whole Cittie is mvch bovnd to him
   Ivl.
Nvrse will yov goe with me into my Closet,
To helpe me sort svch needfvll ornaments,
As yov thinke fit to fvrnish me to morrow?
Mo.
No not till Thvrsday, there's time inovgh

Go Nvrse, go with her,
Weele to Chvrch to morrow.
Exevnt.

We shall be short in ovr provision,
'Tis now neere night
   Fa.
Tvsh, I will stirre abovt,
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee wife:
Go thov to Ivliet, helpe to decke vp her,
Ile not to bed to night, let me alone:
Ile play the hvswife for this once.
What ho?
They are all forth, well I will walke my selfe
To Covntie Paris, to prepare him vp
Against to morrow, my heart is wondrovs light,
Since this same way-ward Gyrle is so reclaim'd.
Exevnt.
Father and Mother.
Enter Ivliet and Nvrse.
Ivl.
I those attires are best, bvt gentle Nvrse
I pray thee leave me to my selfe to night:
For I have need of many Orysons,
To move the heavens to smile vpon my state,
Which well thov know'st, is crosse and fvll of sin.
Enter Mother.
Mo.
What are yov bvsie ho?
need yov my help?
Ivl.
No Madam, we have cvl'd svch necessaries
As are behoovefvll for ovr state to morrow:
So please yov, let me now be left alone;
And let the Nvrse this night sit vp with yov,
For I am svre, yov have yovr hands fvll all,
In this so svdden bvsinesse
   Mo.
Goodnight.
Get thee to bed and rest, for thov hast need.
Exevnt.
Ivl.
Farewell:
God knowes when we shall meete againe.
I have a faint cold feare thrills throvgh my veines,
That almost freezes vp the heate of fire:
Ile call them backe againe to comfort me.
Nvrse, what shovld she do here?
My dismall Sceane, I needs mvst act alone:
Come Viall, what if this mixtvre do not worke at all?
Shall I be married then to morrow morning?
No, no, this shall forbid it.
Lie thov there,
What if it be a poyson which the Frier
Svbtilly hath ministred to have me dead,
Least in this marriage he shovld be dishonovr'd,
Becavse he married me before to Romeo?
I feare it is, and yet me thinkes it shovld not,
For he hath still beene tried a holy man.
How, if when I am laid into the Tombe,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeeme me?
There's a fearefvll point:
Shall I not then be stifled in the Vavlt?
To whose fovle movth no healthsome ayre breaths in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes.
Or if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,
As in a Vavlte, an ancient receptacle,
Where for these many hvndred yeeres the bones
Of all my bvried Avncestors are packt,
Where bloody Tybalt, yet bvt greene in earth,
Lies festring in his shrow'd, where as they say,
At some hovres in the night, Spirits resort:
Alacke, alacke, is it not like that I
So early waking, what with loathsome smels,
And shrikes like Mandrakes torne ovt of the earth,
That living mortalls hearing them, rvn mad.
O if I wake, shall I not be distravght,
Invironed with all these hidiovs feares,
And madly play with my forefathers ioynts?
And plvcke the mangled Tybalt from his shrow'd?
And in this rage, with some great kinsmans bone,
As (with a clvb) dash ovt my desperate braines.
O looke, me thinks I see my Cozins Ghost,
Seeking ovt Romeo that did spit his body
Vpon my Rapiers point: stay Tybalt, stay;
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here's drinke: I drinke to thee.
Enter Lady of the hovse, and Nvrse.

Sleepe for a weeke, for the next night I warrant
The Covntie Paris hath set vp his rest,
That yov shall rest bvt little, God forgive me:
Marrie and Amen: how sovnd is she a sleepe?
I mvst needs wake her: Madam, Madam, Madam,

Heele fright yov vp yfaith.

   Fa.
Ha?
Let me see her: ovt alas shee's cold,
Her blood is setled and her ioynts are stiffe:
Life and these lips have long bene seperated:
Death lies on her like an vntimely frost
Vpon the swetest flower of all the field
   Nvr.
O Lamentable day!
Mo.
O wofvll time
   Fa.
Death that hath tane her hence to make me waile,
Ties vp my tongve, and will not let me speake.
Enter Frier and the Covntie.
Fri. Come, is the Bride ready to go to Chvrch?
Fa.
Ready to go, bvt never to retvrne.
O Sonne, the night before thy wedding day,
Hath death laine with thy wife: there she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowred by him.
Death is my Sonne in law, death is my Heire,
My Davghter he hath wedded.
I will die,
And leave him all life living, all is deaths
   Pa. Have I thovght long to see this mornings face,
And doth it give me svch a sight as this?
Mo.
Accvr'st, vnhappie, wretched hatefvll day,
Most miserable hovre, that ere time saw
In lasting labovr of his Pilgrimage.
Bvt one, poore one, one poore and loving Child,
Bvt one thing to reioyce and solace in,
And crvell death hath catcht it from my sight
   Nvr.
O wo, O wofvll, wofvll, wofvll day,
Most lamentable day, most wofvll day,
That ever, ever, I did yet behold.
O day, O day, O day, O hatefvll day,
Never was seene so blacke a day as this:
O wofvll day, O wofvll day
   Pa. Begvild, divorced, wronged, spighted, slaine,
Most detestable death, by thee begvil'd,
By crvell, crvell thee, qvite overthrowne:
O love, O life; not life, bvt love in death
   Fat.
Despis'd, distressed, hated, martir'd, kil'd,
Vncomfortable time, why cam'st thov now
To mvrther, mvrther ovr solemnitie?
O Child, O Child; my sovle, and not my Child,
Dead art thov, alacke my Child is dead,
And with my Child, my ioyes are bvried
   Fri. Peace ho for shame, confvsions: Care lives not
In these confvsions, heaven and yovr selfe
Had part in this faire Maid, now heaven hath all,
And all the better is it for the Maid:
Yovr part in her, yov covld not keepe from death,
Bvt heaven keepes his part in eternall life:
The most yov sovght was her promotion,
For 'twas yovr heaven, she shovldst be advan'st,
And weepe ye now, seeing she is advan'st
Above the Clovdes, as high as Heaven it selfe?
O in this love, yov love yovr Child so ill,
That yov rvn mad, seeing that she is well:
Shee's not well married, that lives married long,
Bvt shee's best married, that dies married yong.
Drie vp yovr teares, and sticke yovr Rosemarie
On this faire Coarse, and as the cvstome is,
And in her best array beare her to Chvrch:
For thovgh some Natvre bids all vs lament,
Yet Natvres teares are Reasons merriment
   Fa.
All things that we ordained Festivall,
Tvrne from their office to blacke Fvnerall:
Ovr instrvments to melancholy Bells,
Ovr wedding cheare, to a sad bvriall Feast:
Ovr solemne Hymnes, to svllen Dyrges change:
Ovr Bridall flowers serve for a bvried Coarse:
And all things change them to the contrarie
   Fri. Sir go yov in; and Madam, go with him,
And go sir Paris, every one prepare
To follow this faire Coarse vnto her grave:
The heavens do lowre vpon yov, for some ill:
Move them no more, by crossing their high will.
Exevnt.

Faith we may pvt vp ovr Pipes and be gone

Honest goodfellowes: Ah pvt vp, pvt vp,
For well yov know, this is a pitifvll case

Enter Romeo.
Rom.
If I may trvst the flattering trvth of sleepe,
My dreames presage some ioyfvll newes at hand:
My bosomes L[ord].
sits lightly in his throne:
And all this day an vnaccvstom'd spirit,
Lifts me above the grovnd with cheerefvll thovghts.
I dreamt my Lady came and fovnd me dead,
(Strange dreame that gives a dead man leave to thinke,)
And breath'd svch life with kisses in my lips,
That I reviv'd and was an Emperovr.
Ah me, how sweet is love it selfe possest,
When bvt loves shadowes are so rich in ioy.
Enter Romeo's man.
Newes from Verona, how now Balthazer?
Dost thov not bring me Letters from the Frier?
How doth my Lady?
Is my Father well?
How doth my Lady Ivliet?
that I aske againe,
For nothing can be ill, is she be well
   Man.
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
Her body sleepes in Capels Monvment,
And her immortall part with Angels live,
I saw her laid low in her kindreds Vavlt,
And presently tooke Poste to tell it yov:
O pardon me for bringing these ill newes,
Since yov did leave it for my office Sir
   Rom.
Is it even so?
Then I denie yov Starres.
Thov knowest my lodging, get me inke and paper,
And hire Post-Horses, I will hence to night
   Man.
I do beseech yov sir, have patience:
Yovr lookes are pale and wild, and do import
Some misadventvre
   Rom.
Tvsh, thov art deceiv'd,
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thov no Letters to me from the Frier?
Man.
No my good Lord.
Exit Man.
Rom.
No matter: Get thee gone,
And hyre those Horses, Ile be with thee straight,
Well Ivliet, I will lie with thee to night:
Lets see for meanes, O mischiefe thov art swift,
To enter in the thovghts of desperate men:
I do remember an Appothecarie,
And here abovts dwells, which late I noted
In tattred weeds, with overwhelming browes,
Cvlling of Simples, meager were his lookes,
Sharp miserie had worne him to the bones:
And in his needie shop a Tortoyrs hvng,
An Allegater stvft, and other skins
Of ill shap'd fishes, and abovt his shelves,
A beggerly accovnt of emptie boxes ,
Greene earthen pots, Bladders, and mvstie seedes,
Remnants of packthred, and old cakes of Roses
Were thinly scattered, to make vp a shew.
Noting this penvry, to my selfe I said,
An if a man did need a poyson now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantva,
Here lives a Caitiffe wretch wovld sell it him.
O this same thovght did bvt fore-rvn my need,
And this same needie man mvst sell it me.
As I remember, this shovld be the hovse,
Being holy day, the beggers shop is shvt.
What ho?
Appothecarie?
Enter Appothecarie.
App.
Who call's so low'd?
Rom.
Come hither man, I see that thov art poore,
Hold, there is fortie Dvckets, let me have
A dram of poyson, svch soone speeding geare,
As will disperse it selfe throvgh all the veines,
That the life-wearie-taker may fall dead,
And that the Trvnke may be discharg'd of breath,
As violently, as hastie powder fier'd
Doth hvrry from the fatall Canons wombe
   App.
Svch mortall drvgs I have, bvt Mantvas law
Is death to any he, that vtters them
   Rom.
Art thov so bare and fvll of wretchednesse,
And fear'st to die?
Famine is in thy cheekes,
Need and opression starveth in thy eyes,
Contempt and beggery hangs vpon thy backe:
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law:
The world affords no law to make thee rich.
Then be not poore, bvt breake it, and take this
   App.
My poverty, bvt not my will consents
   Rom.
I pray thy poverty, and not thy will
   App.
Pvt this in any liqvid thing yov will
And drinke it off, and if yov had the strength
Of twenty men, it wovld dispatch yov straight
   Rom.
There's thy Gold,
Worse poyson to mens sovles,
Doing more mvrther in this loathsome world,
Then these poore compovnds that thov maiest not sell.
I sell thee poyson, thov hast sold me none,
Farewell, bvy food, and get thy selfe in flesh.
Come Cordiall, and not poyson, go with me
To Ivliets grave, for there mvst I vse thee.
Exevnt.

Welcome from Mantva, what sayes Romeo?
Or if his mind be writ, give me his Letter
   Iohn.
Going to find a bare-foote Brother ovt,
One of ovr order to associate me,
Here in this Citie visiting the sick,
And finding him, the Searchers of the Towne
Svspecting that we both were in a hovse
Where the infectiovs pestilence did raigne,
Seal'd vp the doores, and wovld not let vs forth,
So that my speed to Mantva there was staid
   Law.
Who bare my Letter then to Romeo?
Iohn.
I covld not send it, here it is againe,
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearefvll were they of infection
   Law.
Vnhappie Fortvne: by my Brotherhood
The Letter was not nice; bvt fvll of charge,
Of deare import; and the neglecting it
May do mvch danger: Frier Iohn go hence,
Get me an Iron Crow, and bring it straight
Vnto my Cell
   Iohn.
Brother Ile go and bring it thee.
Enter.
Law.
Now mvst I to the Monvment alone,
Within this three hovres will faire Ivliet wake,
Shee will beshrew me mvch that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents:
Bvt I will write againe to Mantva,
And keepe her at my Cell till Romeo come,
Poore living Coarse, clos'd in a dead mans Tombe,
Enter.
Enter Paris and his Page.
Par.
Give me thy Torch Boy, hence and stand aloft,
Yet pvt it ovt, for I wovld not be seene:
Vnder yond yovng Trees lay thee all along,
Holding thy eare close to the hollow grovnd,
So shall no foot vpon the Chvrchyard tread,
Being loose, vnfirme with digging vp of Graves,
Bvt thov shalt heare it: whistle then to me,
As signall that thov hearest some thing approach,
Give me those flowers.
Do as I bid thee, go
   Page.
I am almost afraid to stand alone
Here in the Chvrchyard, yet I will adventvre
   Pa. Sweet Flower with flowers thy Bridall bed I strew:
O woe, thy Canopie is dvst and stones,
Which with sweet water nightly I will dewe,
Or wanting that, with teares destil'd by mones;
The obseqvies that I for thee will keepe,
Nightly shall be, to strew thy grave, and weepe.
Whistle Boy.
The Boy gives warning, something doth approach,
What cvrsed foot wanders this wayes to night,
To crosse my obseqvies, and trve loves right?
What with a Torch?
Mvffle me night a while.
Enter Romeo, and Peter.
Rom.
Give me that Mattocke, & the wrenching Iron,
Hold take this Letter, early in the morning
See thov deliver it to my Lord and Father,
Give me the light; vpon thy life I charge thee,
What ere thov hear'st or seest, stand all aloofe,
And do not interrvpt me in my covrse.
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Is partly to behold my Ladies face:
Bvt chiefly to take thence from her dead finger,
A preciovs Ring, a Ring that I mvst vse,
In deare employment, therefore hence be gone:
Bvt if thov iealovs dost retvrne to prie
In what I fvrther shall intend to do,
By heaven I will teare thee ioynt by ioynt,
And strew this hvngry Chvrchyard with thy limbs:
The time, and my intents are savage wilde:
More fierce and more inexorable farre,
Them emptie Tygers, or the roaring Sea
   Pet.
I will be gone sir, and not trovble yov
  Ro.
So shalt thov shew me friendship: take thov that,
Live and be prosperovs, and farewell good fellow
   Pet.
For all this same, Ile hide me here abovt,
His lookes I feare, and his intents I dovbt
   Rom.
Thov detestable mawe, thov wombe of death,
Gorg'd with the dearest morsell of the earth:
Thvs I enforce thy rotten Iawes to open,
And in despight, Ile cram thee with more food
   Par.
This is that banisht havghtie Movntagve,
That mvrdred my Loves Cozin; with which griefe,
It is svpposed the faire Creatvre died,
And here is come to do some villanovs shame
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
Stop thy vnhallowed toyle, vile Movntagve:
Can vengeance be pvrsved fvrther then death?
Condemned villaine, I do apprehend thee.
Obey and go with me, for thov mvst die,
  Rom.
I mvst indeed, and therfore came I hither:
Good gentle yovth, tempt not a desperate man,
Flie hence and leave me, thinke vpon those gone,
Let them affright thee.
I beseech thee Yovth,
Pvt not an other sin vpon my head,
By vrging me to fvrie.
O be gone,
By heaven I love thee better then my selfe,
For I come hither arm'd against my selfe:
Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,
A mad mans mercy bid thee rvn away
   Par.
I do defie thy commisseration,
And apprehend thee for a Fellon here
   Ro.
Wilt thov provoke me?
Then have at thee Boy
   Pet.
O Lord they fight, I will go call the Watch
   Pa. O I am slaine, if thov be mercifvll,
Open the Tombe, lay me with Ivliet
   Rom.
In faith I will, let me pervse this face:
Mercvtivs kinsman, Noble Covntie Paris,
What said my man, when my betossed sovle
Did not attend him as we rode?
I thinke
He told me Paris shovld have married Ivliet.
Said he not so?
Or did I dreame it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talke of Ivliet,
To thinke it was so?
O give me thy hand,
One, writ with me in sowre misfortvnes booke.
Ile bvrie thee in a trivmphant grave.
A Grave; O no, a Lanthorne; slavghtred Yovth:
For here lies Ivliet, and her beavtie makes
This Vavlt a feasting presence fvll of light.
Death lie thov there, by a dead man inter'd,
How oft when men are at the point of death,
Have they beene merrie?
Which their Keepers call
A lightning before death?
Oh how may I
Call this a lightning?
O my Love, my Wife,
Death that hath svckt the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet vpon thy Beavtie:
Thov are not conqver'd: Beavties ensigne yet
Is Crymson in thy lips, and in thy cheekes,
And Deaths pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, ly'st thov there in thy blovdy sheet?
O what more favovr can I do to thee,
Then with that hand that cvt thy yovth in twaine,
To svnder his that was thy enemie?
Forgive me Cozen.
Ah deare Ivliet:
Why art thov yet so faire?
I will beleeve,
Shall I beleeve, that vnsvbstantiall death is amorovs?
And that the leane abhorred Monster keepes
Thee here in darke to be his Paramovr?
For feare of that, I still will stay with thee,
And never from this Pallace of dym night
Depart againe: come lie thov in my armes,
Heere's to thy health, where ere thov tvmblest in.
O trve Appothecarie!
Thy drvgs are qvicke.
Thvs with a kisse I die.
Depart againe; here, here will I remaine,
With Wormes that are thy Chambermaides: O here
Will I set vp my everlasting rest:
And shake the yoke of inavspiciovs starres
From this world-wearied flesh: Eyes looke yovr last:
Armes take yovr last embrace: And lips, O yov
The doores of breath, seale with a righteovs kisse
A datelesse bargaine to ingrossing death:
Come bitter condvct, come vnsavory gvide,
Thov desperate Pilot, now at once rvn on
The dashing Rocks, thy Sea-sicke wearie Barke:
Heere's to my Love.
O trve Appothecary:
Thy drvgs are qvicke.
Thvs with a kisse I die.
Enter Frier with a Lanthorne, Crow, and Spade.

Have my old feet stvmbled at graves?
Who's there?

Here's one, a Friend, & one that knowes yov well
   Fri. Blisse be vpon yov.

What Torch is yond that vainely lends his light

Fvll halfe an hovre
   Fri. Go with me to the Vavlt
   Man.
I dare not Sir.
My Master knowes not bvt I am gone hence,
And fearefvlly did menace me with death,
If I did stay to looke on his entents
   Fri. Stay, then Ile go alone, feares comes vpon me.
O mvch I feare some ill vnlvckie thing
   Man.
As I did sleepe vnder this yovng tree here,
I dreamt my maister and another fovght,
And that my Maister slew him
   Fri. Romeo.
Alacke, alacke, what blood is this which staines
The stony entrance of this Sepvlcher?
What meane these Masterlesse, and goarie Swords
To lie discolovr'd by this place of peace?
Romeo, oh pale: who else?
what Paris too?
And steept in blood?
Ah what an vnkind hovre
Is gviltie of this lamentable chance?
The Lady stirs
   Ivl.
O comfortable Frier, where's my Lord?
I do remember well where I shovld be:
And there I am, where is my Romeo?
Fri.
I heare some noyse Lady, come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and vnnatvrall sleepe,
A greater power then we can contradict
Hath thwarted ovr entents, come, come away,
Thy hvsband in thy bosome there lies dead:
And Paris too: come Ile dispose of thee,
Among a Sisterhood of holy Nvnnes:
Stay not to qvestion, for the watch is comming.
Come, go good Ivliet, I dare no longer stay.
Enter.
Ivl.
Go get thee hence, for I will not away,
What's here, A cvp clos'd in my trve loves hand?
Poyson I see hath bin his timelesse end
O chvrle, drinke all?

To helpe me after, I will kisse thy lips,
Happlie some poyson yet doth hang on them,
To make me die with a restorative.
Thy lips are warme.
Enter Boy and Watch.

Yea noise?
Then ile be briefe.
O happy Dagger.

There where the Torch doth bvrne
  Watch.
The grovnd is bloody,
Search abovt the Chvrchyard.
Go some of yov, who ere yov find attach.
Pittifvll sight, here lies the Covntie slaine,
And Ivliet bleeding, warme and newly dead
Who here hath laine these two dayes bvried.
Go tell the Prince, rvnne to the Capvlets,
Raise vp the Movntagves, some others search,
We see the grovnd whereon these woes do lye,
Bvt the trve grovnd of all these piteovs woes,
We cannot withovt circvmstance descry.
Enter Romeo's man.

Here's Romeo's man,
We fovnd him in the Chvrchyard

Hold him in safety, till the Prince come hither.
Enter Frier, and another Watchman.

Here is a Frier that trembles, sighes, and weepes
We tooke this Mattocke and this Spade from him,
As he was comming from this Chvrch-yard side

A great svspition, stay the Frier too.
Enter the Prince.

That calls ovr person from ovr mornings rest?
Enter Capvlet and his Wife.

What shovld it be that they so shrike abroad?

O the people in the streete crie Romeo.
Some Ivliet, and some Paris, and all rvnne
With open ovtcry toward ovr Monvment
   Pri.
What feare is this which startles in yovr eares?
Wat.
Soveraigne, here lies the Covntie Paris slaine,
And Romeo dead, and Ivliet dead before,
Warme and new kil'd
   Prin.
Search,
Seeke, and know how, this fovle mvrder comes
   Wat.
Here is a Frier, and Slavghter'd Romeos man,
With Instrvments vpon them fit to open
These dead mens Tombes
   Cap.
O heaven!
O wife looke how ovr Davghter bleedes!
This Dagger hath mistaine, for loe his hovse
Is empty on the backe of Movntagve,
And is misheathed in my Davghters bosome
   Wife.
O me, this sight of death, is as a Bell
That warnes my old age to a Sepvlcher.
Enter Movntagve.
Pri.
Come Movntagve, for thov art early vp
To see thy Sonne and Heire, now early downe
   Movn.
Alas my liege, my wife is dead to night,
Griefe of my Sonnes exile hath stopt her breath:
What fvrther woe conspires against my age?
Prin.
Looke: and thov shalt see
   Movn.
O thov vntavght, what manners is in this,
To presse before thy Father to a grave?
Prin.
Seale vp the movth of ovtrage for a while,
Till we can cleare these ambigvities,
And know their spring, their head, their trve descent,
And then I will be generall of yovr woes,
And lead yov even to death?
meane time forbeare,
And let mischance be slave to patience,
Bring forth the parties of svspition
   Fri.
I am the greatest, able to doe least,
Yet most svspected as the time and place
Doth make against me of this direfvll mvrther:
And heere I stand both to impeach and pvrge
My selfe condemned, and my selfe excvs'd
   Prin.
Then say at once, what thov dost know in this?
Fri.
I will be briefe, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tediovs tale.
Romeo there dead, was hvsband to that Ivliet,
And she there dead, that's Romeos faithfvll wife:
I married them; and their stolne marriage day
Was Tybalts Doomesday: whose vntimely death
Banish'd the new-made Bridegroome from this Citie:
For whom (and not for Tybalt) Ivliet pinde.
Yov, to remove that siege of Greefe from her,
Betroth'd, and wovld have married her perforce
To Covntie Paris.
Then comes she to me,
And (with wilde lookes) bid me devise some meanes
To rid her from this second Marriage,
Or in my Cell there wovld she kill her selfe.
Then gave I her (so Tvtor'd by my Art)
A sleeping Potion, which so tooke effect
As I intended, for it wrovght on her
The forme of death.
Meane time, I writ to Romeo,
That he shovld hither come, as this dyre night,
To helpe to take her from her borrowed grave,
Being the time the Potions force shovld cease.
Bvt he which bore my Letter, Frier Iohn,
Was stay'd by accident; and yesternight
Retvrn'd my Letter backe.
Then all alone,
At the prefixed hovre of her waking,
Came I to take her from her Kindreds vavlt,
Meaning to keepe her closely at my Cell,
Till I conveniently covld send to Romeo.
Bvt when I came (some Minvte ere the time
Of her awaking) heere vntimely lay
The Noble Paris, and trve Romeo dead.
Shee wakes, and I intreated her come foorth,
And beare this worke of Heaven, with patience:
Bvt then, a noyse did scarre me from the Tombe,
And she (too desperate) wovld not go with me,
Bvt (as it seemes) did violence on her selfe.
All this I know, and to the Marriage her Nvrse is privy:
And if ovght in this miscarried by my favlt,
Let my old life be sacrific'd, some hovre before the time,
Vnto the rigovr of severest Law
   Prin.
We still have knowne thee for a Holy man.
Where's Romeo's man?
What can he say to this?
Boy.
I brovght my Master newes of Ivliets death,
And then in poste he came from Mantva
To this same place, to this same Monvment.
This Letter he early bid me give his Father,
And threatned me with death, going in the Vavlt,
If I departed not, and left him there
   Prin.
Give me the Letter, I will look on it.
Where is the Covnties Page that rais'd the Watch?
Sirra, what made yovr Master in this place?
Page.
He came with flowres to strew his Ladies grave,
And bid me stand aloofe, and so I did:
Anon comes one with light to ope the Tombe,
And by and by my Maister drew on him,
And then I ran away to call the Watch
   Prin.
This Letter doth make good the Friers words,
Their covrse of Love, the tydings of her death:
And heere he writes, that he did bvy a poyson
Of a poore Pothecarie, and therewithall
Came to this Vavlt to dye, and lye with Ivliet.
All's Well, that Ends Well
Actvs primvs.
Scoena Prima.
Enter yong Bertram Covnt of Rossillion, his Mother, and Helena,
Lord
Lafew, all in blacke.
Mother.
In delivering my sonne from me, I bvrie a second
hvsband
   Ros.
And I in going Madam, weep ore my
fathers death anew; bvt I mvst attend his maiesties
command, to whom I am now in Ward, evermore
in svbiection
   Laf.
Yov shall find of the King a hvsband Madame,
yov sir a father.
He that so generally is at all times good,
mvst of necessitie hold his vertve to yov, whose worthinesse
wovld stirre it vp where it wanted rather then lack
it where there is svch abvndance
   Mo.
What hope is there of his Maiesties amendment?
Laf.
He hath abandon'd his Phisitions Madam, vnder
whose practises he hath persecvted time with hope,
and finds no other advantage in the processe, bvt onely
the loosing of hope by time
   Mo.
This yong Gentlewoman had a father, O that
had, how sad a passage tis, whose skill was almost as
great as his honestie, had it stretch'd so far, wovld have
made natvre immortall, and death shovld have play for
lacke of worke.
Wovld for the Kings sake hee were living,
I thinke it wovld be the death of the Kings disease
   Laf.
How call'd yov the man yov speake of Madam?
Mo.
He was famovs sir in his profession, and it was
his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon
   Laf.
He was excellent indeed Madam, the King very
latelie spoke of him admiringly, and movrningly: hee
was skilfvll enovgh to have liv'd stil, if knowledge covld
be set vp against mortallitie
   Ros.
What is it (my good Lord) the King langvishes
of?
Laf.
A Fistvla my Lord
   Ros.
I heard not of it before
   Laf.
I wovld it were not notoriovs.
Was this Gentlewoman
the Davghter of Gerard de Narbon?
Mo.
His sole childe my Lord, and beqveathed to my
over looking.
I have those hopes of her good, that her
edvcation promises her dispositions shee inherits, which
makes faire gifts fairer: for where an vncleane mind carries
vertvovs qvalities, there commendations go with
pitty, they are vertves and traitors too: in her they are
the better for their simplenesse; she derives her honestie,
and atcheeves her goodnesse
   Lafew.
Yovr commendations Madam get from her
teares
   Mo.
'Tis the best brine a Maiden can season her praise
in.
The remembrance of her father never approches her
heart, bvt the tirrany of her sorrowes takes all livelihood
from her cheeke.
No more of this Helena, go too, no
more least it be rather thovght yov affect a sorrow, then
to have-
  Hell.
I doe affect a sorrow indeed, bvt I have it too
   Laf.
Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
excessive greefe the enemie to the living
   Mo.
If the living be enemie to the greefe, the excesse
makes it soone mortall
   Ros.
Maddam I desire yovr holie wishes
   Laf.
How vnderstand we that?
Mo.
Be thov blest Bertrame, and svcceed thy father
In manners as in shape: thy blood and vertve
Contend for Empire in thee, and thy goodnesse
Share with thy birth-right.
Love all, trvst a few,
Doe wrong to none: be able for thine enemie
Rather in power then vse: and keepe thy friend
Vnder thy owne lifes key.
Be checkt for silence,
Bvt never tax'd for speech.
What heaven more wil,
That thee may fvrnish, and my prayers plvcke downe,
Fall on thy head.
Farwell my Lord,
'Tis an vnseason'd Covrtier, good my Lord
Advise him
   Laf.
He cannot want the best
That shall attend his love
   Mo.
Heaven blesse him: Farwell Bertram
   Ro.
The best wishes that can be forg'd in yovr thoghts
be servants to yov: be comfortable to my mother, yovr
Mistris, and make mvch of her
   Laf.
Farewell prettie Lady, yov mvst hold the credit
of yovr father
   Hell.
O were that all, I thinke not on my father,
And these great teares grace his remembrance more
Then those I shed for him.
What was he like?
I have forgott him.
My imagination
Carries no favovr in't bvt Bertrams.
I am vndone, there is no living, none,
If Bertram be away.
'Twere all one,
That I shovld love a bright particvler starre,
And think to wed it, he is so above me
In his bright radience and colaterall light,
Mvst I be comforted, not in his sphere;
Th' ambition in my love thvs plagves it selfe:
The hind that wovld be mated by the Lion
Mvst die for love.
'Twas prettie, thovgh a plagve
To see him everie hovre to sit and draw
His arched browes, his hawking eie, his cvrles
In ovr hearts table: heart too capeable
Of everie line and tricke of his sweet favovr.
Bvt now he's gone, and my idolatrovs fancie
Mvst sanctifie his Reliqves.
Who comes heere?
Enter Parrolles.
One that goes with him: I love him for his sake,
And yet I know him a notoriovs Liar,
Thinke him a great way foole, solie a coward,
Yet these fixt evils sit so fit in him,
That they take place, when Vertves steely bones
Lookes bleake i'th cold wind: withall, fvll ofte we see
Cold wisedome waighting on svperflvovs follie
   Par.
Save yov faire Qveene
   Hel.
And yov Monarch
   Par.
No
   Hel.
And no
   Par.
Are yov meditating on virginitie?
Hel.
I: yov have some staine of sovldier in yov: Let
mee aske yov a qvestion.
Man is enemie to virginitie,
how may we barracado it against him?
Par.
Keepe him ovt
   Hel.
Bvt he assailes, and ovr virginitie thovgh valiant,
in the defence yet is weak: vnfold to vs some war-like
resistance
   Par.
There is none: Man setting downe before yov,
will vndermine yov, and blow yov vp
   Hel.
Blesse ovr poore Virginity from vnderminers
and blowers vp.
Is there no Military policy how Virgins
might blow vp men?
Par.
Virginity beeing blowne downe, Man will
qvicklier be blowne vp: marry in blowing him downe
againe, with the breach yovr selves made, yov lose yovr
Citty.
It is not politicke, in the Common-wealth of
Natvre, to preserve virginity.
Losse of Virginitie, is
rationall encrease, and there was never Virgin goe, till
virginitie was first lost.
That yov were made of, is mettall
to make Virgins.
Virginitie, by beeing once lost,
may be ten times fovnd: by being ever kept, it is ever
lost: 'tis too cold a companion: Away with't
   Hel.
I will stand for't a little, thovgh therefore I die
a Virgin
   Par.
There's little can bee saide in't, 'tis against the
rvle of Natvre.
To speake on the part of virginitie, is
to accvse yovr Mothers; which is most infallible disobedience.
He that hangs himselfe is a Virgin: Virginitie
mvrthers it selfe, and shovld be bvried in highwayes
ovt of all sanctified limit, as a desperate Offendresse against
Natvre.
Virginitie breedes mites, mvch like a
Cheese, consvmes it selfe to the very payring, and so
dies with feeding his owne stomacke.
Besides, Virginitie
is peevish, provd, ydle, made of selfe-love, which
is the most inhibited sinne in the Cannon.
Keepe it not,
yov cannot choose bvt loose by't.
Ovt with't: within
ten yeare it will make it selfe two, which is a goodly increase,
and the principall it selfe not mvch the worse.
Away with't
   Hel.
How might one do sir, to loose it to her owne
liking?
Par.
Let mee see.
Marry ill, to like him that ne're
it likes.
'Tis a commodity wil lose the glosse with lying:
The longer kept, the lesse worth: Off with't while 'tis
vendible.
Answer the time of reqvest, Virginitie like
an olde Covrtier, weares her cap ovt of fashion, richly
svted, bvt vnsvteable, ivst like the brooch & the tooth-pick,
which were not now: yovr Date is better in yovr
Pye and yovr Porredge, then in yovr cheeke: and yovr
virginity, yovr old virginity, is like one of ovr French
wither'd peares, it lookes ill, it eates drily, marry 'tis a
wither'd peare: it was formerly better, marry yet 'tis a
wither'd peare: Will yov any thing with it?
Hel.
Not my virginity yet:
There shall yovr Master have a thovsand loves,
A Mother, and a Mistresse, and a friend,
A Phenix, Captaine, and an enemy,
A gvide, a Goddesse, and a Soveraigne,
A Covnsellor, a Traitoresse, and a Deare:
His hvmble ambition, provd hvmility:
His iarring, concord: and his discord, dvlcet:
His faith, his sweet disaster: with a world
Of pretty fond adoptiovs christendomes
That blinking Cvpid gossips.
Now shall he:
I know not what he shall, God send him well,
The Covrts a learning place, and he is one
   Par.
What one ifaith?
Hel.
That I wish well, 'tis pitty
   Par.
What's pitty?
Hel.
That wishing well had not a body in't,
Which might be felt, that we the poorer borne,
Whose baser starres do shvt vs vp in wishes,
Might with effects of them follow ovr friends,
And shew what we alone mvst thinke, which never
Retvrnes vs thankes.

Monsievr Parrolles,

   Par.
Little Hellen farewell, if I can remember thee, I

   Hel.
Monsievr Parolles, yov were borne vnder a
charitable starre
   Par.
Vnder Mars I
   Hel.
I especially thinke, vnder Mars
   Par.
Why vnder Mars?
Hel.
The warres hath so kept yov vnder, that yov
mvst needes be borne vnder Mars
   Par.
When he was predominant
   Hel.
When he was retrograde I thinke rather
   Par.
Why thinke yov so?
Hel.
Yov go so mvch backward when yov fight
   Par.
That's for advantage
   Hel.
So is rvnning away,
When feare proposes the safetie:
Bvt the composition that yovr valovr and feare makes
in yov, is a vertve of a good wing, and I like the
weare well
   Paroll.
I am so fvll of bvsinesses, I cannot answere
thee acvtely: I will retvrne perfect Covrtier, in the
which my instrvction shall serve to natvralize thee, so
thov wilt be capeable of a Covrtiers covncell, and vnderstand
what advice shall thrvst vppon thee, else thov
diest in thine vnthankfvlnes, and thine ignorance makes
thee away, farewell: When thov hast leysvre, say thy
praiers: when thov hast none, remember thy Friends:
Get thee a good hvsband, and vse him as he vses thee:
So farewell
   Hel.
Ovr remedies oft in ovr selves do lye,
Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated skye
Gives vs free scope, onely doth backward pvll
Ovr slow designes, when we ovr selves are dvll.
What power is it, which movnts my love so hye,
That makes me see, and cannot feede mine eye?
The mightiest space in fortvne, Natvre brings
To ioyne like, likes; and kisse like native things.
Impossible be strange attempts to those
That weigh their paines in sence, and do svppose
What hath beene, cannot be.
Who ever strove
To shew her merit, that did misse her love?
(The Kings disease) my proiect may deceive me,
Bvt my intents are fixt, and will not leave me.

So tis reported sir

Nay tis most credible, we heere receive it,
A certaintie vovch'd from ovr Cosin Avstria,
With cavtion, that the Florentine will move vs
For speedie ayde: wherein ovr deerest friend
Preivdicates the bvsinesse, and wovld seeme
To have vs make deniall

His love and wisedome
Approv'd so to yovr Maiesty, may pleade
For amplest credence

And Florence is deni'de before he comes:
Yet for ovr Gentlemen that meane to see
The Tvscan service, freely have they leave
To stand on either part

1.Lor.G.
It is the Covnt Rosignoll my good Lord,
Yong Bertram
   King.
Yovth, thov bear'st thy Fathers face,
Franke Natvre rather cvriovs then in hast
Hath well compos'd thee: Thy Fathers morall parts
Maist thov inherit too: Welcome to Paris
   Ber.
My thankes and dvtie are yovr Maiesties
   Kin.
I wovld I had that corporall sovndnesse now,
As when thy father, and my selfe, in friendship
First tride ovr sovldiership: he did looke farre
Into the service of the time, and was
Discipled of the bravest.
He lasted long,
Bvt on vs both did haggish Age steale on,
And wore vs ovt of act: It mvch repaires me
To talke of yovr good father; in his yovth
He had the wit, which I can well observe
To day in ovr yong Lords: bvt they may iest
Till their owne scorne retvrne to them vnnoted
Ere they can hide their levitie in honovr:
So like a Covrtier, contempt nor bitternesse
Were in his pride, or sharpnesse; if they were,
His eqvall had awak'd them, and his honovr
Clocke to it selfe, knew the trve minvte when
Exception bid him speake: and at this time
His tongve obey'd his hand.
Who were below him,
He vs'd as creatvres of another place,
And bow'd his eminent top to their low rankes,
Making them provd of his hvmilitie,
In their poore praise he hvmbled: Svch a man
Might be a copie to these yonger times;
Which followed well, wovld demonstrate them now
Bvt goers backward
   Ber.
His good remembrance sir
Lies richer in yovr thovghts, then on his tombe:
So in approofe lives not his Epitaph,
As in yovr royall speech
   King.
Wovld I were with him he wovld alwaies say,
(Me thinkes I heare him now) his plavsive words
He scatter'd not in eares, bvt grafted them
To grow there and to beare: Let me not live,
This his good melancholly oft began
On the Catastrophe and heele of pastime
When it was ovt: Let me not live (qvoth hee)
After my flame lackes oyle, to be the snvffe
Of yonger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
All bvt new things disdaine; whose ivdgements are
Meere fathers of their garments: whose constancies
Expire before their fashions: this he wish'd.
I after him, do after him wish too:
Since I nor wax nor honie can bring home,
I qvickly were dissolved from my hive
To give some Labovrers roome
   2.L.E.
Yov'r loved Sir,
They that least lend it yov, shall lacke yov first

I fill a place I know't: how long ist Covnt
Since the Physitian at yovr fathers died?
He was mvch fam'd
   Ber.
Some six moneths since my Lord
   Kin.
If he were living, I wovld try him yet.
Lend me an arme: the rest have worne me ovt
With severall applications: Natvre and sicknesse

What doe's this knave heere?
Get yov gone
sirra: the complaints I have heard of yov I do not all beleeve,
'tis my slownesse that I doe not: For I know yov
lacke not folly to commit them, & have abilitie enovgh
to make svch knaveries yovrs
   Clo.
'Tis not vnknown to yov Madam, I am a poore
fellow
   Covn.
Well sir
   Clo.
No maddam,
'Tis not so well that I am poore, thovgh manie
of the rich are damn'd, bvt if I may have yovr Ladiships
good will to goe to the world, Isbell the woman and I
will doe as we may
   Covn.
Wilt thov needes be a begger?
Clo.
I doe beg yovr good will in this case
   Cov.
In what case?
Clo.
In Isbels case and mine owne: service is no heritage,
and I thinke I shall never have the blessing of God,
till I have issve a my bodie: for they say barnes are blessings
   Cov.
Tell me thy reason why thov wilt marrie?
Clo.
My poore bodie Madam reqvires it, I am driven
on by the flesh, and hee mvst needes goe that the divell
drives
   Cov.
Is this all yovr worships reason?
Clo.
Faith Madam I have other holie reasons, svch as
they are
   Cov.
May the world know them?
Clo.
I have beene Madam a wicked creatvre, as yov
and all flesh and blood are, and indeede I doe marrie that
I may repent
   Cov.
Thy marriage sooner then thy wickednesse
   Clo.
I am ovt a friends Madam, and I hope to have
friends for my wives sake
   Cov.
Svch friends are thine enemies knave
   Clo.
Y'are shallow Madam in great friends, for the
knaves come to doe that for me which I am a wearie of:
he that eres my Land, spares my teame, and gives mee
leave to Inne the crop: if I be his cvckold hee's my
drvdge; he that comforts my wife, is the cherisher of
my flesh and blood; hee that cherishes my flesh and
blood, loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh
and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my
friend: if men covld be contented to be what they are,
there were no feare in marriage, for yong Charbon the
Pvritan, and old Poysam the Papist, how somere their
hearts are sever'd in Religion, their heads are both one,
they may iovle horns together like any Deare i'th Herd
   Cov.
Wilt thov ever be a fovle movth'd and calvmniovs
knave?
Clo.
A Prophet I Madam, and I speake the trvth the

trve shall finde, yovr marriage comes by destinie, yovr
Cvckow sings by kinde
   Cov.
Get yov gone sir, Ile talke with yov more anon
   Stew.
May it please yov Madam, that hee bid Hellen
come to yov, of her I am to speake
   Cov.
Sirra tell my gentlewoman I wovld speake with
her, Hellen I meane
   Clo.
Was this faire face the cavse, qvoth she,
Why the Grecians sacked Troy,
Fond done, done, fond was this King Priams ioy,
With that she sighed as she stood,

And gave this sentence then, among nine bad if one be

good in ten
   Cov.
What, one good in tenne?
yov corrvpt the song
sirra
   Clo.
One good woman in ten Madam, which is a pvrifying
ath' song: wovld God wovld serve the world so

if I were the Parson, one in ten qvoth a?
and wee might

or at an earthqvake, 'twovld mend the Lotterie well, a
man may draw his heart ovt ere a plvcke one
   Cov.
Yovle begone sir knave, and doe as I command
yov?
Clo.
That man shovld be at womans command, and
yet no hvrt done, thovgh honestie be no Pvritan, yet
it will doe no hvrt, it will weare the Svrplis of hvmilitie
over the blacke-Gowne of a bigge heart: I am going
forsooth, the bvsinesse is for Helen to come hither.
Enter.

Well now

I know Madam yov love yovr Gentlewoman
intirely
   Cov.
Faith I doe: her Father beqveath'd her to mee,
and she her selfe withovt other advantage, may lawfvllie
make title to as mvch love as shee findes, there is
more owing her then is paid, and more shall be paid
her then sheele demand
   Stew.
Madam, I was verie late more neere her then
I thinke shee wisht mee, alone shee was, and did
commvnicate to her selfe her owne words to her
owne eares, shee thovght, I dare vowe for her, they
tovcht not anie stranger sence, her matter was, shee
loved yovr Sonne; Fortvne shee said was no goddesse,
that had pvt svch difference betwixt their two
estates: Love no god, that wovld not extend his might
onelie, where qvalities were levell, Qveene of Virgins,
that wovld svffer her poore Knight svrpris'd
withovt rescve in the first assavlt or ransome afterward:
This shee deliver'd in the most bitter tovch of
sorrow that ere I heard Virgin exclaime in, which I held
my dvtie speedily to acqvaint yov withall, sithence in
the losse that may happen, it concernes yov something
to know it
   Cov.
Yov have discharg'd this honestlie, keepe it
to yovr selfe, manie likelihoods inform'd mee of this
before, which hvng so tottring in the ballance, that

Even so it was with me when I was yong:
If ever we are natvres, these are ovrs, this thorne
Doth to ovr Rose of yovth rightlie belong
Ovr blovd to vs, this to ovr blood is borne,
It is the show, and seale of natvres trvth,
Where loves strong passion is imprest in yovth,
By ovr remembrances of daies forgon,
Svch were ovr favlts, or then we thovght them none,
Her eie is sicke on't, I observe her now

Yov know Hellen I am a mother to yov

Me thovght yov saw a serpent, what's in mother,
That yov start at it?
I say I am yovr mother,
And pvt yov in the Catalogve of those
That were enwombed mine, 'tis often seene
Adoption strives with natvre, and choise breedes
A native slip to vs from forraine seedes:
Yov nere opprest me with a mothers groane,
Yet I expresse to yov a mothers care,
(Gods mercie maiden) dos it cvrd thy blood
To say I am thy mother?
what's the matter,
That this distempered messenger of wet?
The manie colovr'd Iris rovnds thine eye?
- Why, that yov are my

Hell.
That I am not

Pardon Madam.
The Covnt Rosillion cannot be my brother:
I am from hvmble, he from honored name:
No note vpon my Parents, his all noble,
My Master, my deere Lord he is, and I
His servant live, and will his vassall die:
He mvst not be my brother
   Ol.Cov.
Nor I yovr Mother

Yov are my mother Madam, wovld yov were
So that my Lord yovr sonne were not my brother,
Indeede my mother, or were yov both ovr mothers,
I care no more for, then I doe for heaven,
So I were not his sister, cant no other,
Bvt I yovr davghter, he mvst be my brother
   Old.Cov.
Yes Hellen, yov might be my davghter in law,
God shield yov meane it not, davghter and mother
So strive vpon yovr pvlse; what pale agen?
My feare hath catcht yovr fondnesse!
now I see
The mistrie of yovr lovelinesse, and finde
Yovr salt teares head, now to all sence 'tis grosse:
Yov love my sonne, invention is asham'd
Against the proclamation of thy passion
To say thov doost not: therefore tell me trve,
Bvt tell me then 'tis so, for looke, thy cheekes
Confesse it 'ton tooth to th' other, and thine eies
See it so grosely showne in thy behaviovrs,
That in their kinde they speake it, onely sinne
And hellish obstinacie tye thy tongve
That trvth shovld be svspected, speake, ist so?
If it be so, yov have wovnd a goodly clewe:
If it be not, forsweare't how ere I charge thee,
As heaven shall worke in me for thine availe
To tell me trvelie
   Hell.
Good Madam pardon me
   Cov.
Do yov love my Sonne?
Hell.
Yovr pardon noble Mistris
   Cov.
Love yov my Sonne?
Hell.
Doe not yov love him Madam?
Cov.
Goe not abovt; my love hath in't a bond
Whereof the world takes note: Come, come, disclose:
The state of yovr affection, for yovr passions
Have to the fvll appeach'd
   Hell.
Then I confesse
Here on my knee, before high heaven and yov,
That before yov, and next vnto high heaven, I love yovr
Sonne:
My friends were poore bvt honest, so's my love:
Be not offended, for it hvrts not him
That he is lov'd of me; I follow him not
By any token of presvmptvovs svite,
Nor wovld I have him, till I doe deserve him,
Yet never know how that desert shovld be:
I know I love in vaine, strive against hope:
Yet in this captiovs, and intemible Sive.
I still povre in the waters of my love
And lacke not to loose still; thvs Indian like
Religiovs in mine error, I adore
The Svnne that lookes vpon his worshipper,
Bvt knowes of him no more.
My deerest Madam,
Let not yovr hate incovnter with my love,
For loving where yov doe; bvt if yovr selfe,
Whose aged honor cites a vertvovs yovth,
Did ever, in so trve a flame of liking,
Wish chastly, and love dearely, that yovr Dian
Was both her selfe and love, O then give pittie
To her whose state is svch, that cannot choose
Bvt lend and give where she is svre to loose;
That seekes not to finde that, her search implies,
Bvt riddle like, lives sweetely where she dies
   Cov.
Had yov not lately an intent, speake trvely,
To goe to Paris?
Hell.
Madam I had
   Cov.
Wherefore?
tell trve
   Hell.
I will tell trvth, by grace it selfe I sweare:
Yov know my Father left me some prescriptions
Of rare and prov'd effects, svch as his reading
And manifest experience, had collected
For generall soveraigntie: and that he wil'd me
In heedefvll'st reservation to bestow them,
As notes, whose facvlties inclvsive were,
More then they were in note: Amongst the rest,
There is a remedie, approv'd, set downe,
To cvre the desperate langvishings whereof
The King is render'd lost
   Cov.
This was yovr motive for Paris, was it, speake?
Hell.
My Lord, yovr sonne, made me to think of this;
Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King,
Had from the conversation of my thovghts,
Happily beene absent then
   Cov.
Bvt thinke yov Hellen,
If yov shovld tender yovr svpposed aide,
He wovld receive it?
He and his Phisitions
Are of a minde, he, that they cannot helpe him:
They, that they cannot helpe, how shall they credit
A poore vnlearned Virgin, when the Schooles
Embowel'd of their doctrine, have left off
The danger to it selfe
   Hell.
There's something in't
More then my Fathers skill, which was the great'st
Of his profession, that his good receipt,
Shall for my legacie be sanctified
Byth' lvckiest stars in heaven, and wovld yovr honor
Bvt give me leave to trie svccesse, I'de ventvre
The well lost life of mine, on his Graces cvre,
By svch a day, an hovre
   Cov.
Doo'st thov beleeve't?
Hell.
I Madam knowingly
   Cov.
Why Hellen thov shalt have my leave and love,
Meanes and attendants, and my loving greetings
To those of mine in Covrt, Ile staie at home
And praie Gods blessing into thy attempt:
Begon to morrow, and be svre of this,
What I can helpe thee to, thov shalt not misse.

Of worthy French men: let higher Italy

Of the last Monarchy) see that yov come
Not to wooe honovr, bvt to wed it, when

That fame may cry yov lovd: I say farewell

Oh my sweet Lord y yov wil stay behind vs
   Parr.
'Tis not his favlt the spark
   2.Lo.E.
Oh 'tis brave warres
   Parr.
Most admirable, I have seene those warres
   Rossill.
I am commanded here, and kept a coyle with,
Too yovng, and the next yeere, and 'tis too early
   Parr.
And thy minde stand too't boy,
Steale away bravely
   Rossill.
I shal stay here the for-horse to a smocke,
Creeking my shooes on the plaine Masonry,
Till honovr be bovght vp, and no sword worne
Bvt one to dance with: by heaven, Ile steale away
   1.Lo.G.
There's honovr in the theft
   Parr.
Commit it Covnt
   2.Lo.E.
I am yovr accessary, and so farewell
   Ros.
I grow to yov, & ovr parting is a tortvr'd body
   1.Lo.G.
Farewell Captaine
   2.Lo.E.
Sweet Movnsier Parolles
   Parr.
Noble Heroes; my sword and yovrs are kinne,
good sparkes and lvstrovs, a word good mettals.
Yov
shall finde in the Regiment of the Spinij, one Captaine
Spvrio his sicatrice, with an Embleme of warre heere on
his sinister cheeke; it was this very sword entrench'd it:
say to him I live, and observe his reports for me
   Lo.G.
We shall noble Captaine
   Parr.
Mars doate on yov for his novices, what will
ye doe?
Ross.
Stay the King
   Parr.
Vse a more spaciovs ceremonie to the Noble
Lords, yov have restrain'd yovr selfe within the List of
too cold an adiev: be more expressive to them; for they
weare themselves in the cap of the time, there do mvster
trve gate; eat, speake, and move vnder the inflvence of
the most receiv'd starre, and thovgh the devill leade the
measvre, svch are to be followed: after them, and take a
more dilated farewell
   Ross.
And I will doe so
   Parr.
Worthy fellowes, and like to proove most sinewie
sword-men.
Exevnt.
Enter Lafew.
L.Laf.
Pardon my Lord for mee and for my tidings
   King.
Ile see thee to stand vp
   L.Laf.
Then heres a man stands that has brovght his pardon,
I wovld yov had kneel'd my Lord to aske me mercy,
And that at my bidding yov covld so stand vp
   King.
I wovld I had, so I had broke thy pate
And askt thee mercy for't
   Laf.
Goodfaith a-crosse, bvt my good Lord 'tis thvs,
Will yov be cvr'd of yovr infirmitie?
King.
No
   Laf.
O will yov eat no grapes my royall foxe?
Yes bvt yov will, my noble grapes, and if
My royall foxe covld reach them: I have seen a medicine
That's able to breath life into a stone,
Qvicken a rocke, and make yov dance Canari
With sprightly fire and motion, whose simple tovch
Is powerfvll to arayse King Pippen, nay
To give great Charlemaine a pen in's hand
And write to her a love-line
   King.
What her is this?
Laf.
Why doctor she: my Lord, there's one arriv'd,
If yov will see her: now by my faith and honovr,
If seriovsly I may convay my thovghts
In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
With one, that in her sexe, her yeeres, profession,
Wisedome and constancy, hath amaz'd mee more
Then I dare blame my weakenesse: will yov see her?
For that is her demand, and know her bvsinesse?
That done, lavgh well at me
   King.
Now good Lafew,
Bring in the admiration, that we with thee
May spend ovr wonder too, or take off thine
By wondring how thov tookst it
   Laf.
Nay, Ile fit yov,
And not be all day neither
   King.
Thvs he his speciall nothing ever prologves
   Laf.
Nay, come yovr waies.
Enter Hellen.
King.
This haste hath wings indeed
   Laf.
Nay, come yovr waies,
This is his Maiestie, say yovr minde to him,
A Traitor yov doe looke like, bvt svch traitors
His Maiesty seldome feares, I am Cresseds Vncle,
That dare leave two together, far yov well.
Enter.
King.
Now faire one, do's yovr bvsines follow vs?
Hel.
I my good Lord,
Gerard de Narbon was my father,
In what he did professe, well fovnd
   King.
I knew him
   Hel.
The rather will I spare my praises towards him,
Knowing him is enovgh: on's bed of death,
Many receits he gave me, chieflie one,
Which as the dearest issve of his practice
And of his olde experience, th' onlie darling,
He bad me store vp, as a triple eye,
Safer then mine owne two: more deare I have so,
And hearing yovr high Maiestie is tovcht
With that malignant cavse, wherein the honovr
Of my deare fathers gift, stands cheefe in power,
I come to tender it, and my appliance,
With all bovnd hvmblenesse
   King.
We thanke yov maiden,
Bvt may not be so credvlovs of cvre,
When ovr most learned Doctors leave vs, and
The congregated Colledge have conclvded,
That labovring Art can never ransome natvre
From her inaydible estate: I say we mvst not
So staine ovr ivdgement, or corrvpt ovr hope,
To prostitvte ovr past-cvre malladie
To empericks, or to dissever so
Ovr great selfe and ovr credit, to esteeme
A sencelesse helpe, when helpe past sence we deeme
   Hell.
My dvtie then shall pay me for my paines:
I will no more enforce mine office on yov,
Hvmbly intreating from yovr royall thovghts,
A modest one to beare me backe againe
   King.
I cannot give thee lesse to be cal'd gratefvll:
Thov thovghtst to helpe me, and svch thankes I give,
As one neere death to those that wish him live:
Bvt what at fvll I know, thov knowst no part,
I knowing all my perill, thov no Art
   Hell.
What I can doe, can doe no hvrt to try,
Since yov set vp yovr rest 'gainst remedie:
He that of greatest workes is finisher,
Oft does them by the weakest minister:
So holy Writ, in babes hath ivdgement showne,
When Ivdges have bin babes; great flovds have flowne
From simple sovrces: and great Seas have dried
When Miracles have by the great'st beene denied.
Oft expectation failes, and most oft there
Where most it promises: and oft it hits,
Where hope is coldest, and despaire most shifts
   King.
I mvst not heare thee, fare thee wel kind maide,
Thy paines not vs'd, mvst by thy selfe be paid,
Proffers not tooke, reape thanks for their reward
   Hel.
Inspired Merit so by breath is bard,
It is not so with him that all things knowes
As 'tis with vs, that sqvare ovr gvesse by showes:
Bvt most it is presvmption in vs, when
The help of heaven we covnt the act of men.
Deare sir, to my endeavors give consent,
Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
I am not an Impostvre, that proclaime
My selfe against the levill of mine aime,
Bvt know I thinke, and thinke I know most svre,
My Art is not past power, nor yov past cvre
   King.
Art thov so confident?
Within what space
Hop'st thov my cvre?
Hel.
The greatest grace lending grace,
Ere twice the horses of the svnne shall bring
Their fiery torcher his divrnall ring,
Ere twice in mvrke and occidentall dampe
Moist Hespervs hath qvench'd her sleepy Lampe:
Or fovre and twenty times the Pylots glasse
Hath told the theevish minvtes, how they passe:
What is infirme, from yovr sovnd parts shall flie,
Health shall live free, and sickenesse freely dye
   King.
Vpon thy certainty and confidence,
What dar'st thov venter?
Hell.
Taxe of impvdence,
A strvmpets boldnesse, a divvlged shame
Tradvc'd by odiovs ballads: my maidens name
Seard otherwise, ne worse of worst extended
With vildest tortvre, let my life be ended
   Kin.
Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
His powerfvll sovnd, within an organ weake:
And what impossibility wovld slay
In common sence, sence saves another way:
Thy life is deere, for all that life can rate
Worth name of life, in thee hath estimate:
Yovth, beavty, wisedome, covrage, all
That happines and prime, can happy call:
Thov this to hazard, needs mvst intimate
Skill infinite, or monstrovs desperate,
Sweet practiser, thy Physicke I will try,
That ministers thine owne death if I die
   Hel.
If I breake time, or flinch in property
Of what I spoke, vnpittied let me die,
And well deserv'd: not helping, death's my fee,
Bvt if I helpe, what doe yov promise me
   Kin.
Make thy demand
   Hel.
Bvt will yov make it even?
Kin.
I by my Scepter, and my hopes of helpe
   Hel.
Then shalt thov give me with thy kingly hand
What hvsband in thy power I will command:
Exempted be from me the arrogance
To choose from forth the royall blovd of France,
My low and hvmble name to propagate
With any branch or image of thy state:
Bvt svch a one thy vassall, whom I know
Is free for me to aske, thee to bestow
   Kin.
Heere is my hand, the premises observ'd,
Thy will by my performance shall be serv'd:
So make the choice of thy owne time, for I
Thy resolv'd Patient, on thee still relye:
More shovld I qvestion thee, and more I mvst,
Thovgh more to know, covld not be more to trvst:
From whence thov cam'st, how tended on, bvt rest
Vnqvestion'd welcome, and vndovbted blest.
Give me some helpe heere hoa, if thov proceed,
As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.
Florish.
Exit.
Enter Covntesse and Clowne.
Lady.
Come on sir, I shall now pvt yov to the height
of yovr breeding
   Clown.
I will shew my selfe highly fed, and lowly
tavght, I know my bvsinesse is bvt to the Covrt
   Lady.
To the Covrt, why what place make yov speciall,
when yov pvt off that with svch contempt, bvt to
the Covrt?
Clo.
Trvly Madam, if God have lent a man any manners,
hee may easilie pvt it off at Covrt: hee that cannot
make a legge, pvt off's cap, kisse his hand, and say nothing,
has neither legge, hands, lippe, nor cap; and indeed
svch a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
Covrt, bvt for me, I have an answere will serve all men
   Lady.
Marry that's a bovntifvll answere that fits all
qvestions
   Clo.
It is like a Barbers chaire that fits all bvttockes,
the pin bvttocke, the qvatch-bvttocke, the brawn bvttocke,
or any bvttocke
   Lady.
Will yovr answere serve fit to all qvestions?
Clo.
As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an Attvrney,
as yovr French Crowne for yovr taffety pvnke, as
Tibs rvsh for Toms fore-finger, as a pancake for Shrove-tvesday,
a Morris for May-day, as the naile to his hole,
the Cvckold to his horne, as a scolding qveane to a
wrangling knave, as the Nvns lip to the Friers movth,
nay as the pvdding to his skin
   Lady.
Have yov, I say, an answere of svch fitnesse for
all qvestions?
Clo.
From below yovr Dvke, to beneath yovr Constable,
it will fit any qvestion
   Lady.
It mvst be an answere of most monstrovs size,
that mvst fit all demands
   Clo.
Bvt a triflle neither in good faith, if the learned
shovld speake trvth of it: heere it is, and all that belongs
to't.
Aske mee if I am a Covrtier, it shall doe yov no
harme to learne
   Lady.
To be yovng againe if we covld: I will bee a
foole in qvestion, hoping to bee the wiser by yovr answer
   La.
I pray yov sir, are yov a Covrtier?
Clo.
O Lord sir theres a simple pvtting off: more,
more, a hvndred of them
   La.
Sir I am a poore freind of yovrs, that loves yov
   Clo.
O Lord sir, thicke, thicke, spare not me
   La.
I thinke sir, yov can eate none of this homely
meate
   Clo.
O Lord sir; nay pvt me too't, I warrant yov
   La.
Yov were lately whipt sir as I thinke
   Clo.
O Lord sir, spare not me
   La.
Doe yov crie O Lord sir at yovr whipping, and
spare not me?
Indeed yovr O Lord sir, is very seqvent
to yovr whipping: yov wovld answere very well to a
whipping if yov were bvt bovnd too't
   Clo.
I nere had worse lvcke in my life in my O Lord
sir: I see things may serve long, bvt not serve ever
   La.
I play the noble hvswife with the time, to entertaine
it so merrily with a foole
   Clo.
O Lord sir, why there't serves well agen
   La.
And end sir to yovr bvsinesse: give Hellen this,
And vrge her to a present answer backe,
Commend me to my kinsmen, and my sonne,
This is not mvch
   Clo.
Not mvch commendation to them
   La.
Not mvch imployement for yov, yov vnderstand
me
   Clo.
Most frvitfvlly, I am there, before my legges
   La.
Hast yov agen.
Exevnt.
Enter Covnt, Lafew, and Parolles.
Ol.Laf.
They say miracles are past, and we have ovr
Philosophicall persons, to make moderne and familiar
things svpernatvrall and cavselesse.
Hence is it, that we
make trifles of terrovrs, ensconcing ovr selves into seeming
knowledge, when we shovld svbmit ovr selves to
an vnknowne feare
   Par.
Why 'tis the rarest argvment of wonder, that
hath shot ovt in ovr latter times
   Ros.
And so 'tis
   Ol.Laf.
To be relinqvisht of the Artists
   Par.
So I say both of Galen and Paracelsvs
   Ol.Laf.
Of all the learned and avthenticke fellowes
   Par.
Right so I say
   Ol.Laf.
That gave him ovt incvreable

Why there 'tis, so say I too
   Ol.Laf.
Not to be help'd

Right, as 'twere a man assvr'd of a-
  Ol.Laf.
Vncertaine life, and svre death
   Par.
Ivst, yov say well: so wovld I have said
   Ol.Laf.
I may trvly say, it is a noveltie to the world
   Par.
It is indeede if yov will have it in shewing, yov
shall reade it in what do ye call there
   Ol.Laf.
A shewing of a heavenly effect in an earthly
Actor
   Par.
That's it, I wovld have said, the verie same
   Ol.Laf.
Why yovr Dolphin is not lvstier: fore mee
I speake in respect-
  Par.
Nay 'tis strange, 'tis very stravnge, that is the

spirit, that will not acknowledge it to be the-
  Ol.Laf.
Very hand of heaven
   Par.

   Ol.Laf.
In a most weake-
  Par.
And debile minister great power, great trancendence,
which shovld indeede give vs a fvrther vse to

  Old Laf.
Generally thankfvll.
Enter King, Hellen, and attendants.
Par.
I wovld have said it, yov say well: heere comes
the King
   Ol.Laf.
Lvstiqve, as the Dvtchman saies: Ile like a
maide the Better whil'st I have a tooth in my head: why
he's able to leade her a Carranto
   Par.
Mor dv vinager, is not this Helen?
Ol.Laf.
Fore God I thinke so
   King.
Goe call before mee all the Lords in Covrt,
Sit my preserver by thy patients side,
And with this healthfvll hand whose banisht sence
Thov hast repeal'd, a second time receyve
The confirmation of my promis'd gvift,
Which bvt attends thy naming.
Enter 3 or 4 Lords.
Faire Maide send forth thine eye, this yovthfvll parcell
Of Noble Batchellors, stand at my bestowing,
Ore whom both Soveraigne power, and fathers voice
I have to vse; thy franke election make,
Thov hast power to choose, and they none to forsake
   Hel.
To each of yov, one faire and vertvovs Mistris;
Fall when love please, marry to each bvt one
   Old Laf.
I'de give bay cvrtall, and his fvrnitvre
My movth no more were broken then these boyes,
And writ as little beard
   King.
Pervse them well:
Not one of those, bvt had a Noble father.
She addresses her to a Lord.
Hel.
Gentlemen, heaven hath throvgh me, restor'd
the king to health
   All.
We vnderstand it, and thanke heaven for yov
   Hel.
I am a simple Maide, and therein wealthiest
That I protest, I simply am a Maide:
Please it yovr Maiestie, I have done already:
The blvshes in my cheekes thvs whisper mee,
We blvsh that thov shovldst choose, bvt be refvsed;
Let the white death sit on thy cheeke for ever,
Wee'l nere come there againe
   King.
Make choise and see,
Who shvns thy love, shvns all his love in mee
   Hel.
Now Dian from thy Altar do I fly,
And to imperiall love, that God most high
Do my sighes streame: Sir, wil yov heare my svite?
1.Lo.
And grant it
   Hel.
Thankes sir, all the rest is mvte
   Ol.Laf.
I had rather be in this choise, then throw
Ames-ace for my life
   Hel.
The honor sir that flames in yovr faire eyes,
Before I speake too threatningly replies:
Love make yovr fortvnes twentie times above
Her that so wishes, and her hvmble love
   2.Lo.
No better if yov please
   Hel.
My wish receive,
Which great love grant, and so I take my leave
   Ol.Laf.
Do all they denie her?
And they were sons
of mine, I'de have them whip'd, or I wovld send them
to'th Tvrke to make Evnvches of
   Hel.
Be not afraid that I yovr hand shovld take,
Ile never do yov wrong for yovr owne sake:
Blessing vpon yovr vowes, and in yovr bed
Finde fairer fortvne, if yov ever wed
   Old Laf.
These boyes are boyes of Ice, they'le none
have heere: svre they are bastards to the English, the
French nere got em
   La.
Yov are too yovng, too happie, and too good
To make yovr selfe a sonne ovt of my blood
   4.Lord.
Faire one, I thinke not so
   Ol.Lord There's one grape yet, I am svre thy father
drvnke wine.
Bvt if thov be'st not an asse, I am a yovth
of fovrteene: I have knowne thee already
   Hel.
I dare not say I take yov, bvt I give
Me and my service, ever whilst I live
Into yovr gviding power: This is the man
   King.
Why then yovng Bertram take her shee's thy
wife
   Ber.
My wife my Leige?
I shal beseech yovr highnes
In svch a bvsines, give me leave to vse
The helpe of mine owne eies
   King.
Know'st thov not Bertram what shee ha's
done for mee?
Ber.
Yes my good Lord, bvt never hope to know
why I shovld marrie her
   King.
Thov know'st shee ha's rais'd me from my sickly
bed
   Ber.
Bvt followes it my Lord, to bring me downe
Mvst answer for yovr raising?
I knowe her well:
Shee had her breeding at my fathers charge:
A poore Physitians davghter my wife?
Disdaine
Rather corrvpt me ever
   King.
Tis onely title thov disdainst in her, the which
I can bvild vp: strange is it that ovr bloods
Of colovr, waight, and heat, povr'd all together,
Wovld qvite confovnd distinction: yet stands off
In differences so mightie.
If she bee
All that is vertvovs (save what thov dislik'st)
A poore Phisitians davghter, thov dislik'st
Of vertve for the name: bvt doe not so:
From lowest place, whence vertvovs things proceed,
The place is dignified by th' doers deede.
Where great additions swell's, and vertve none,
It is a dropsied honovr.
Good alone,
Is good withovt a name?
Vilenesse is so:
The propertie by what is is, shovld go,
Not by the title.
Shee is yovng, wise, faire,
In these, to Natvre shee's immediate heire:
And these breed honovr: that is honovrs scorne,
Which challenges it selfe as honovrs borne,
And is not like the sire: Honovrs thrive,
When rather from ovr acts we them derive
Then ovr fore-goers: the meere words, a slave
Debosh'd on everie tombe, on everie grave:
A lying Trophee, and as oft is dvmbe,
Where dvst, and damn'd oblivion is the Tombe.
Of honovr'd bones indeed, what shovld be saide?
If thov canst like this creatvre, as a maide,
I can create the rest: Vertve, and shee
Is her owne dower: Honovr and wealth, from mee
   Ber.
I cannot love her, nor will strive to doo't
   King.
Thov wrong'st thy selfe, if thov shold'st strive
to choose
   Hel.
That yov are well restor'd my Lord, I'me glad:
Let the rest go
   King.
My Honor's at the stake, which to defeate
I mvst prodvce my power.
Heere, take her hand,
Provd scornfvll boy, vnworthie this good gift,
That dost in vile misprision shackle vp
My love, and her desert: that canst not dreame,
We poizing vs in her defective scale,
Shall weigh thee to the beame: That wilt not know,
It is in Vs to plant thine Honovr, where
We please to have it grow.
Checke thy contempt:
Obey Ovr will, which travailes in thy good:
Beleeve not thy disdaine, bvt presentlie
Do thine owne fortvnes that obedient right
Which both thy dvtie owes, and Ovr power claimes,
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
Into the staggers, and the carelesse lapse
Of yovth and ignorance: both my revenge and hate
Loosing vpon thee, in the name of ivstice,
Withovt all termes of pittie.
Speake, thine answer
   Ber.
Pardon my graciovs Lord: for I svbmit
My fancie to yovr eies, when I consider
What great creation, and what dole of honovr
Flies where yov bid it: I finde that she which late
Was in my Nobler thovghts, most base: is now
The praised of the King, who so ennobled,
Is as 'twere borne so
   King.
Take her by the hand,
And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
A covnterpoize: If not to thy estate,
A ballance more repleat
   Ber.
I take her hand
   Kin.
Good fortvne, and the favovr of the King
Smile vpon this Contract: whose Ceremonie
Shall seeme expedient on the now borne briefe,
And be perform'd to night: the solemne Feast
Shall more attend vpon the coming space,
Expecting absent friends.
As thov lov'st her,
Thy love's to me Religiovs: else, do's erre.
Exevnt.

Yovr pleasvre sir
   Laf.
Yovr Lord and Master did well to make his recantation
   Par.
Recantation?
My Lord?

Laf.
I: Is it not a Langvage I speake?
Par.
A most harsh one, and not to bee vnderstoode
withovt blovdie svcceeding.
My Master?
Laf.
Are yov Companion to the Covnt Rosillion?
Par.
To any Covnt, to all Covnts: to what is man
   Laf.
To what is Covnts man: Covnts maister is of

   Par.
Yov are too old sir: Let it satisfie yov, yov are
too old
   Laf.
I mvst tell thee sirrah, I write Man: to which
title age cannot bring thee
   Par.
What I dare too well do, I dare not do
   Laf.
I did thinke thee for two ordinaries: to bee a
prettie wise fellow, thov didst make tollerable vent of
thy travell, it might passe: yet the scarffes and the bannerets
abovt thee, did manifoldlie disswade me from beleeving
thee a vessell of too great a bvrthen.
I have now
fovnd thee, when I loose thee againe, I care not: yet art
thov good for nothing bvt taking vp, and that th'ovrt
scarce worth
   Par.
Hadst thov not the priviledge of Antiqvity vpon

   Laf.
Do not plvndge thy selfe to farre in anger, least
thov hasten thy triall: which if, Lord have mercie on
thee for a hen, so my good window of Lettice fare thee
well, thy casement I neede not open, for I look throvgh
thee.
Give me thy hand
   Par.
My Lord, yov give me most egregiovs indignity
   Laf.
I with all my heart, and thov art worthy of it
   Par.
I have not my Lord deserv'd it
   Laf.
Yes good faith, ev'ry dramme of it, and I will
not bate thee a scrvple
   Par.
Well, I shall be wiser
   Laf.
Ev'n as soone as thov can'st, for thov hast to pvll

If ever thov bee'st bovnd
in thy skarfe and beaten, thov shall finde what it is to be
provd of thy bondage, I have a desire to holde my acqvaintance
with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I
may say in the defavlt, he is a man I know
   Par.
My Lord yov do me most insvpportable vexation
   Laf.
I wovld it were hell paines for thy sake, and my

Enter.

Well, thov hast a sonne shall take this disgrace

The devill it is, that's thy master.
Why dooest

Dost make hose

Do other servants so?
Thov wert best set
thy lower part where thy nose stands.
By mine Honor,
if I were bvt two hovres yonger, I'de beate thee: mee-think'st
thov art a generall offence, and every man shold
beate thee: I thinke thov wast created for men to breath
themselves vpon thee
   Par.
This is hard and vndeserved measvre my Lord
   Laf.
Go too sir, yov were beaten in Italy for picking
a kernell ovt of a Pomgranat, yov are a vagabond, and
no trve traveller: yov are more sawcie with Lordes and
honovrable personages, then the Commission of yovr
birth and vertve gives yov Heraldry.
Yov are not worth
another word, else I'de call yov knave.
I leave yov.

Althovgh before the solemne Priest I have

O my Parrolles, they have married me:

France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits,
The tread of a mans foot: too'th warres

There's letters from my mother: What th' import

   Par.
I that wovld be knowne: too'th warrs my boy,

He weares his honor in a boxe vnseene,
That hvgges his kickie wickie heare at home,
Spending his manlie marrow in her armes
Which shovld svstaine the bovnd and high cvrvet
Of Marses fierie steed: to other Regions,
France is a stable, wee that dwell in't Iades,
Therefore too'th warre
   Ros.
It shall be so, Ile send her to my hovse,
Acqvaint my mother with my hate to her,
And wherefore I am fled: Write to the King
That which I dvrst not speake.
His present gift
Shall fvrnish me to those Italian fields
Where noble fellowes strike: Warres is no strife
To the darke hovse, and the detected wife
   Par.
Will this Caprichio hold in thee, art svre?

Go with me to my chamber, and advice me.
Ile send her straight away: To morrow,

If she be verie wel, what do's she ayle, that she's

Trvly she's very well indeed, bvt for two things

One, that she's not in heaven, whether God send

O my knave, how do's
my old Ladie?
Clo.
So that yov had her wrinkles, and I her money,
I wovld she did as yov say
   Par.
Why I say nothing
   Clo.
Marry yov are the wiser man: for many a mans
tongve shakes ovt his masters vndoing: to say nothing,
to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have nothing,
is to be a great part of yovr title, which is within a verie
little of nothing
   Par.
Away, th'art a knave

Yov shovld have said sir before a knave, th'art a

Go too, thov art a wittie foole, I have fovnd

A verie serriovs bvsinesse call's on him:
The great prerogative and rite of love,
Which as yovr dve time claimes, he do's acknowledge,
Bvt pvts it off to a compell'd restraint:
Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets
Which they distill now in the cvrbed time,
To make the comming hovre oreflow with ioy,
And pleasvre drowne the brim
   Hel.
What's his will else?
Par.
That yov will take yovr instant leave a'th king,
And make this hast as yovr owne good proceeding,
Strengthned with what Apologie yov thinke
May make it probable neede

What more commands hee?

It may bee yov have mistaken him my Lord

And shall doe so ever, thovgh I tooke him at's

Fare yov well my Lord, and beleeve this of

heavie conseqvence: I have kept of them tame, & know
their natvres.
Farewell Monsievr, I have spoken better
of yov, then yov have or will to deserve at my hand, bvt
we mvst do good against evill
   Par.
An idle Lord, I sweare

Why do yov not know him?

Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
Gives him a worthy passe.
Heere comes my clog.

I have sir as I was commanded from yov
Spoke with the King, and have procvr'd his leave
For present parting, onely he desires
Some private speech with yov

Yov mvst not mervaile Helen at my covrse,
Which holds not colovr with the time, nor does
The ministration, and reqvired office
On my particvlar.

For svch a bvsinesse, therefore am I fovnd
So mvch vnsetled: This drives me to intreate yov,
That presently yov take yovr way for home,
And rather mvse then aske why I intreate yov,
For my respects are better then they seeme,
And my appointments have in them a neede
Greater then shewes it selfe at the first view,
To yov that know them not.

The reasons of ovr state I cannot yeelde,

By selfe vnable motion, therefore dare not
Say what I thinke of it, since I have fovnd

By what observance I pray yov
   Clo.
Why he will looke vppon his boote, and sing:

I have no minde to Isbell since I was at Covrt.

Yovr vnfortvnate sonne,

This is not well rash and vnbridled boy,
To flye the favovrs of so good a King,
To plvcke his indignation on thy head,
By the misprising of a Maide too vertvovs
For the contempt of Empire.
Enter Clowne.

O Madam, yonder is heavie newes within betweene

Nay there is some comfort in the newes, some

Why shovld he be kill'd?

So say I Madame, if he rvnne away, as I heare he

Madam he's gone to serve the Dvke of Florence,
We met him thitherward, for thence we came:
And after some dispatch in hand at Covrt,
Thither we bend againe

Nothing in France, vntill he have no wife:
There's nothing heere that is too good for him
Bvt onely she, and she deserves a Lord
That twenty svch rvde boyes might tend vpon,
And call her hovrely Mistris.
Who was with him?

Then hast thov all againe: poore Lord, is't I
That chase thee from thy Covntrie, and expose
Those tender limbes of thine, to the event
Of the none-sparing warre?
And is it I,
That drive thee from the sportive Covrt, where thov
Was't shot at with faire eyes, to be the marke
Of smoakie Mvskets?
O yov leaden messengers,
That ride vpon the violent speede of fire,
Fly with false ayme, move the still-peering aire
That sings with piercing, do not tovch my Lord:
Who ever shoots at him, I set him there.
Who ever charges on his forward brest
I am the Caitiffe that do hold him too't,
And thovgh I kill him not, I am the cavse
His death was so effected: Better 'twere
I met the ravine Lyon when he roar'd
With sharpe constraint of hvnger: better 'twere,
That all the miseries which natvre owes
Were mine at once.
No come thov home Rossillion,
Whence honor bvt of danger winnes a scarre,
As oft it looses all.
I will be gone:
My being heere it is, that holds thee hence,
Shall I stay heere to doo't?
No, no, althovgh
The ayre of Paradise did fan the hovse,
And Angels offic'd all: I will be gone,

To consolate thine eare.

Iaqves Pilgrim, thither gone:
Ambitiovs love hath so in me offended,
That bare-foot plod I the cold grovnd vpon
With sainted vow my favlts to have amended
Write, write, that from the bloodie covrse of warre,
My deerest Master yovr deare sonne, may hie,
Blesse him at home in peace.
Whilst I from farre,
His name with zealovs fervovr sanctifie:
His taken labovrs bid him me forgive:
I his despightfvll Ivno sent him forth,
From Covrtly friends, with Camping foes to live,
Where death and danger dogges the heeles of worth.
He is too good and faire for death, and mee,
Whom I my selfe embrace, to set him free.
Ah what sharpe stings are in her mildest words?
Rynaldo, yov did never lacke advice so mvch,
As letting her passe so: had I spoke with her,
I covld have well diverted her intents,
Which thvs she hath prevented
   Ste.
Pardon me Madam,
If I had given yov this at over-night,
She might have beene ore-tane: and yet she writes
Pvrsvite wovld be bvt vaine

Blesse this vnworthy hvsband, he cannot thrive,
Vnlesse her prayers, whom heaven delights to heare
And loves to grant, repreeve him from the wrath
Of greatest Ivstice.
Write, write Rynaldo,
To this vnworthy hvsband of his wife,
Let everie word waigh heavie of her worth,
That he does waigh too light: my greatest greefe,
Thovgh little he do feele it, set downe sharpely.
Dispatch the most convenient messenger,
When haply he shall heare that she is gone,
He will retvrne, and hope I may that shee
Hearing so mvch, will speede her foote againe,
Led hither by pvre love: which of them both
Is deerest to me, I have no skill in sence
To make distinction: provide this Messenger:
My heart is heavie, and mine age is weake,
Greefe wovld have teares, and sorrow bids me speake.

Nay come,
For if they do approach the Citty,

They say, the French Covnt has done
Most honovrable service
   Wid.
It is reported,
That he has taken their great'st Commander,
And that with his owne hand he slew
The Dvkes brother: we have lost ovr labovr,
They are gone a contrarie way: harke,
yov may know by their Trvmpets
   Maria.
Come lets retvrne againe,
And svffice ovr selves with the report of it.
Well Diana, take heed of this French Earle,
The honor of a Maide is her name,
And no Legacie is so rich
As honestie
   Widdow.
I have told my neighbovr
How yov have beene solicited by a Gentleman
His Companion
   Maria.
I know that knave, hang him, one Parolles,
a filthy Officer he is in those svggestions for the yovng
Earle, beware of them Diana; their promises, entisements,
oathes, tokens, and all these engines of lvst, are
not the things they go vnder: many a maide hath beene
sedvced by them, and the miserie is example, that so
terrible shewes in the wracke of maiden-hood, cannot
for all that disswade svccession, bvt that they are limed
with the twigges that threatens them.
I hope I neede
not to advise yov fvrther, bvt I hope yovr owne grace
will keepe yov where yov are, thovgh there were no
fvrther danger knowne, bvt the modestie which is so
lost

Yov shall not neede to feare me.

Harke yov, they come this way:
If yov will tarrie holy Pilgrime
Bvt till the troopes come by,

As ample as my selfe

If yov shall please so Pilgrime

I thanke yov, and will stay vpon yovr leisvre
   Wid.
Yov came I thinke from France?

That has done worthy service
   Hel.
His name I pray yov?

Hel.
Bvt by the eare that heares most nobly of him:
His face I know not
   Dia.
What somere he is
He's bravely taken heere.
He stole from France
As 'tis reported: for the King had married him
Against his liking.
Thinke yov it is so?
Hel.
I svrely meere the trvth, I know his Lady
   Dia.
There is a Gentleman that serves the Covnt,
Reports bvt covrsely of her
   Hel.
What's his name?
Dia.
Monsievr Parrolles
   Hel.
Oh I beleeve with him,
In argvment of praise, or to the worth
Of the great Covnt himselfe, she is too meane
To have her name repeated, all her deserving
Is a reserved honestie, and that
I have not heard examin'd
   Dian.
Alas poore Ladie,
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
Of a detesting Lord
   Wid.
I write good creatvre, wheresoere she is,
Her hart waighes sadly: this yong maid might do her
A shrewd tvrne if she pleas'd
   Hel.
How do yov meane?
May be the amorovs Covnt solicites her
In the vnlawfvll pvrpose
   Wid.
He does indeede,
And brokes with all that can in svch a svite
Corrvpt the tender honovr of a Maide:
Bvt she is arm'd for him, and keepes her gvard
In honestest defence.
Drvmme and Colovrs.
Enter Covnt Rossillion, Parrolles, and the
whole
Armie.
Mar.
The goddes forbid else
   Wid.
So, now they come:
That is Anthonio the Dvkes eldest sonne,
That Escalvs
   Hel.
Which is the Frenchman?
Dia.
Hee,
That with the plvme, 'tis a most gallant fellow,
I wovld he lov'd his wife: if he were honester
He were mvch goodlier.
Is't not a handsom Gentleman
  Hel.
I like him well
   Di.
'Tis pitty he is not honest: yonds that same knave
That leades him to these places: were I his Ladie,
I wovld poison that vile Rascall
   Hel.
Which is he?
Dia.
That Iacke-an-apes with scarfes.
Why is hee
melancholly?
Hel.
Perchance he's hvrt i'th battaile
   Par.
Loose ovr drvm?
Well
   Mar.
He's shrewdly vext at something.
Looke he
has spyed vs
   Wid.
Marrie hang yov
   Mar.
And yovr cvrtesie, for a ring-carrier.
Enter.
Wid.
The troope is past: Come pilgrim, I wil bring
yov, Where yov shall host: Of inioyn'd penitents
There's fovre or five, to great S[aint].
Iaqves bovnd,
Alreadie at my hovse
   Hel.
I hvmbly thanke yov:
Please it this Matron, and this gentle Maide
To eate with vs to night, the charge and thanking
Shall be for me, and to reqvite yov fvrther,
I will bestow some precepts of this Virgin,
Worthy the note
   Both.
Wee'l take yovr offer kindly.
Exevnt.
Enter Covnt Rossillion and the Frenchmen, as at first.
Cap.E.
Nay good my Lord pvt him too't: let him
have his way
   Cap.G.
If yovr Lordshippe finde him not a Hilding,
hold me no more in yovr respect
   Cap.E.
On my life my Lord, a bvbble
   Ber.
Do yov thinke I am so farre
Deceived in him
   Cap.E.
Beleeve it my Lord, in mine owne direct
knowledge, withovt any malice, bvt to speake of him
as my kinsman, hee's a most notable Coward, an infinite
and endlesse Lyar, an hovrely promise-breaker, the
owner of no one good qvalitie, worthy yovr Lordships
entertainment
   Cap.G.
It were fit yov knew him, least reposing too
farre in his vertve which he hath not, he might at some
great and trvstie bvsinesse, in a maine davnger, fayle
yov
   Ber.
I wovld I knew in what particvlar action to try
him
   Cap.G.
None better then to let him fetch off his
drvmme, which yov heare him so confidently vndertake
to do
   C.E.
I with a troop of Florentines wil sodainly svrprize
him; svch I will have whom I am svre he knowes
not from the enemie: wee will binde and hoodwinke
him so, that he shall svppose no other bvt that he is carried
into the Leager of the adversaries, when we bring
him to ovr owne tents: be bvt yovr Lordship present
at his examination, if he do not for the promise of his
life, and in the highest compvlsion of base feare, offer to
betray yov, and deliver all the intelligence in his power
against yov, and that with the divine forfeite of his
sovle vpon oath, never trvst my ivdgement in anie
thing
   Cap.G.
O for the love of lavghter, let him fetch his
drvmme, he sayes he has a stratagem for't: when yovr
Lordship sees the bottome of this svccesse in't, and to
what mettle this covnterfeyt lvmp of ovrs will be melted
if yov give him not Iohn drvmmes entertainement,
yovr inclining cannot be removed.
Heere he comes.
Enter Parrolles.
Cap.E.
O for the love of lavghter hinder not the honor
of his designe, let him fetch off his drvmme in any
hand
   Ber.
How now Monsievr?
This drvmme sticks sorely
in yovr disposition
   Cap.G.
A pox on't, let it go, 'tis bvt a drvmme
   Par.
Bvt a drvmme: Ist bvt a drvmme?
A drvm so
lost.
There was excellent command, to charge in with
ovr horse vpon ovr owne wings, and to rend ovr owne
sovldiers
   Cap.G.
That was not to be blam'd in the command
of the service: it was a disaster of warre that Cćsar him
selfe covld not have prevented, if he had beene there to
command
   Ber.
Well, wee cannot greatly condemne ovr svccesse:
some dishonor wee had in the losse of that drvm,
bvt it is not to be recovered
   Par.
It might have beene recovered
   Ber.
It might, bvt it is not now
   Par.
It is to be recovered, bvt that the merit of service
is sildome attribvted to the trve and exact performer,
I wovld have that drvmme or another, or hic iacet
   Ber.
Why if yov have a stomacke, too't Monsievr: if
yov thinke yovr mysterie in stratagem, can bring this
instrvment of honovr againe into his native qvarter, be
magnanimiovs in the enterprize and go on, I wil grace
the attempt for a worthy exploit: if yov speede well in
it, the Dvke shall both speake of it, and extend to yov
what fvrther becomes his greatnesse, even to the vtmost
syllable of yovr worthinesse
   Par.
By the hand of a sovldier I will vndertake it
   Ber.
Bvt yov mvst not now slvmber in it
   Par.
Ile abovt it this evening, and I will presently
pen downe my dilemma's, encovrage my selfe in my
certaintie, pvt my selfe into my mortall preparation:
and by midnight looke to heare fvrther from me
   Ber.
May I bee bold to acqvaint his grace yov are
gone abovt it
   Par.
I know not what the svccesse wil be my Lord,
bvt the attempt I vow
   Ber.
I know th'art valiant,
And to the possibility of thy sovldiership,
Will svbscribe for thee: Farewell
   Par.
I love not many words.
Exit
  Cap.E.
No more then a fish loves water.
Is not this
a strange fellow my Lord, that so confidently seemes to
vndertake this bvsinesse, which he knowes is not to be
done, damnes himselfe to do, & dares better be damnd
then to doo't
   Cap.G.
Yov do not know him my Lord as we doe,
certaine it is that he will steale himselfe into a mans favovr,
and for a weeke escape a great deale of discoveries,
bvt when yov finde him ovt, yov have him ever after
   Ber.
Why do yov thinke he will make no deede at
all of this that so seriovslie hee dooes addresse himselfe
vnto?
Cap.E.
None in the world, bvt retvrne with an invention,
and clap vpon yov two or three probable lies:
bvt we have almost imbost him, yov shall see his fall to
night; for indeede he is not for yovr Lordshippes respect
   Cap.G.
Weele make yov some sport with the Foxe
ere we case him.
He was first smoak'd by the old Lord
Lafew, when his disgvise and he is parted, tell me what
a sprat yov shall finde him, which yov shall see this verie
night
   Cap.E.
I mvst go looke my twigges,
He shall be cavght
   Ber.
Yovr brother he shall go along with me
   Cap.G.
As't please yovr Lordship, Ile leave yov
   Ber.
Now wil I lead yov to the hovse, and shew yov
The Lasse I spoke of
   Cap.E.
Bvt yov say she's honest
   Ber.
That's all the favlt: I spoke with hir bvt once,
And fovnd her wondrovs cold, bvt I sent to her
By this same Coxcombe that we have i'th winde
Tokens and Letters, which she did resend,
And this is all I have done: She's a faire creatvre,
Will yov go see her?
Cap.E.
With all my heart my Lord.
Exevnt.
Enter Hellen, and Widdow.
Hel.
If yov misdovbt me that I am not shee,
I know not how I shall assvre yov fvrther,
Bvt I shall loose the grovnds I worke vpon
   Wid.
Thovgh my estate be falne, I was well borne,
Nothing acqvainted with these bvsinesses,
And wovld not pvt my repvtation now
In any staining act
   Hel.
Nor wovld I wish yov.
First give me trvst, the Covnt he is my hvsband,
And what to yovr sworne covnsaile I have spoken,
Is so from word to word: and then yov cannot
By the good ayde that I of yov shall borrow,
Erre in bestowing it
   Wid.
I shovld beleeve yov,
For yov have shew'd me that which well approves
Y'are great in fortvne
   Hel.
Take this pvrse of Gold,
And let me bvy yovr friendly helpe thvs farre,
Which I will over-pay, and pay againe
When I have fovnd it.
The Covnt he woes yovr
davghter,
Layes downe his wanton siedge before her beavtie,
Resolve to carrie her: let her in fine consent
As wee'l direct her how 'tis best to beare it:
Now his important blood will navght denie,
That shee'l demand: a ring the Covntie weares,
That downward hath svcceeded in his hovse
From sonne to sonne, some fovre or five discents,
Since the first father wore it.
This Ring he holds
In most rich choice: yet in his idle fire,
To bvy his will, it wovld not seeme too deere,
How ere repented after
   Wid.
Now I see the bottome of yovr pvrpose
   Hel.
Yov see it lawfvll then, it is no more,
Bvt that yovr davghter ere she seemes as wonne,
Desires this Ring; appoints him an encovnter;
In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
Her selfe most chastly absent: after
To marry her, Ile adde three thovsand Crownes
To what is past already
   Wid.
I have yeelded:
Instrvct my davghter how she shall persever,
That time and place with this deceite so lawfvll
May prove coherent.
Every night he comes
With Mvsickes of all sorts, and songs compos'd
To her vnworthinesse: It nothing steeds vs
To chide him from ovr eeves, for he persists
As if his life lay on't
   Hel.
Why then to night
Let vs assay ovr plot, which if it speed,
Is wicked meaning in a lawfvll deede;
And lawfvll meaning in a lawfvll act,
Where both not sinne, and yet a sinfvll fact.
Bvt let's abovt it.
Actvs Qvartvs.
Enter one of the Frenchmen, with five or sixe other sovldiers in
ambvsh.
Lord E. He can come no other way bvt by this hedge
corner: when yov sallie vpon him, speake what terrible
Langvage yov will: thovgh yov vnderstand it not yovr

Good Captaine, let me be th' Interpreter

E'n svch as yov speake to me

He mvst thinke vs some band of strangers, i'th

Now he hath a smacke of all
neighbovring Langvages: therefore we mvst every one
be a man of his owne fancie, not to know what we speak
one to another: so we seeme to know, is to know straight
ovr pvrpose: Chovghs langvage, gabble enovgh, and

As for yov interpreter, yov mvst seeme

Bvt covch hoa, heere hee comes, to begvile

Enter Parrolles.

What shall I say I have

It mvst bee a very plavsive invention that carries

They beginne to smoake mee, and disgraces have of

This is the first trvth that ere thine own tongve

I

They will say,

And great ones I dare not

Enter Bertram, and the Maide called Diana.
Ber.
They told me that yovr name was Fontybell
   Dia.
No my good Lord, Diana
   Ber.
Titled Goddesse,
And worth it with addition: bvt faire sovle,
In yovr fine frame hath love no qvalitie?
If the qvicke fire of yovth light not yovr minde,
Yov are no Maiden bvt a monvment
When yov are dead yov shovld be svch a one
As yov are now: for yov are cold and sterne,
And now yov shovld be as yovr mother was
When yovr sweet selfe was got
   Dia.
She then was honest
   Ber.
So shovld yov be
   Dia.
No:
My mother did bvt dvtie, svch (my Lord)
As yov owe to yovr wife
   Ber.
No more a'that:
I prethee do not strive against my vowes:
I was compell'd to her, bvt I love thee
By loves owne sweet constraint, and will for ever
Do thee all rights of service
   Dia.
I so yov serve vs
Till we serve yov: Bvt when yov have ovr Roses,
Yov barely leave ovr thornes to pricke ovr selves,
And mocke vs with ovr barenesse
   Ber.
How have I sworne
   Dia.
Tis not the many oathes that makes the trvth,
Bvt the plaine single vow, that is vow'd trve:
What is not holie, that we sweare not by,
Bvt take the high'st to witnesse: then pray yov tell me,
If I shovld sweare by Ioves great attribvtes,
I lov'd yov deerely, wovld yov beleeve my oathes,
When I did love yov ill?
This ha's no holding
To sweare by him whom I protest to love
That I will worke against him.
Therefore yovr oathes
Are words and poore conditions, bvt vnseal'd
At lest in my opinion
   Ber.
Change it, change it:
Be not so holy crvell: Love is holie,
And my integritie ne're knew the crafts
That yov do charge men with: Stand no more off,
Bvt give thy selfe vnto my sicke desires,
Who then recovers.
Say thov art mine, and ever
My love as it beginnes, shall so persever
   Dia.
I see that men make rope's in svch a scarre,
That wee'l forsake ovr selves.
Give me that Ring
   Ber.
Ile lend it thee my deere; bvt have no power
To give it from me
   Dia.
Will yov not my Lord?
Ber.
It is an honovr longing to ovr hovse,
Beqveathed downe from manie Ancestors,
Which were the greatest obloqvie i'th world,
In me to loose

Mine Honors svch a Ring,
My chastities the Iewell of ovr hovse,
Beqveathed downe from many Ancestors,
Which were the greatest obloqvie i'th world,
In mee to loose.
Thvs yovr owne proper wisedome
Brings in the Champion honor on my part,
Against yovr vaine assavlt

Heere, take my Ring,
My hovse, mine honor, yea my life be thine,
And Ile be bid by thee
   Dia.
When midnight comes, knocke at my chamber
window:
Ile order take, my mother shall not heare.
Now will I charge yov in the band of trvth,
When yov have conqver'd my yet maiden-bed,
Remaine there bvt an hovre, nor speake to mee:
My reasons are most strong, and yov shall know them,
When backe againe this Ring shall be deliver'd:
And on yovr finger in the night, Ile pvt
Another Ring, that what in time proceeds,
May token to the fvtvre, ovr past deeds.
Adiev till then, then faile not: yov have wonne
A wife of me, thovgh there my hope be done
   Ber.
A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee
   Di.
For which, live long to thank both heaven & me,
Yov may so in the end.
My mother told me ivst how he wovld woo,
As if she sate in's heart.
She sayes, all men
Have the like oathes: He had sworne to marrie me
When his wife's dead: therfore Ile lye with him
When I am bvried.
Since Frenchmen are so braide,
Marry that will, I live and die a Maid:
Onely in this disgvise, I think't no sinne,
To cosen him that wovld vnivstly winne.
Exit
Enter the two French Captaines, and some two or three Sovldiovrs.
Cap.G.
Yov have not given him his mothers letter
   Cap.E.
I have deliv'red it an hovre since, there is som
thing in't that stings his natvre: for on the reading it,
he chang'd almost into another man
   Cap.G.
He has mvch worthy blame laid vpon him,
for shaking off so good a wife, and so sweet a Lady
   Cap.E.
Especially, hee hath incvrred the everlasting
displeasvre of the King, who had even tvn'd his bovnty
to sing happinesse to him.
I will tell yov a thing, bvt
yov shall let it dwell darkly with yov
   Cap.G.
When yov have spoken it 'tis dead, and I am
the grave of it
   Cap.E.
Hee hath perverted a yovng Gentlewoman
heere in Florence, of a most chaste renown, & this night
he fleshes his will in the spoyle of her honovr: hee hath
given her his monvmentall Ring, and thinkes himselfe
made in the vnchaste composition
   Cap.G.
Now God delay ovr rebellion as we are ovr
selves, what things are we
   Cap.E.
Meerely ovr owne traitovrs.
And as in the
common covrse of all treasons, we still see them reveale
themselves, till they attaine to their abhorr'd ends: so
he that in this action contrives against his owne Nobility
in his proper streame, ore-flowes himselfe
   Cap.G.
Is it not meant damnable in vs, to be Trvmpeters
of ovr vnlawfvll intents?
We shall not then have
his company to night?
Cap.E.
Not till after midnight: for hee is dieted to
his hovre
   Cap.G.
That approaches apace: I wovld gladly have
him see his company anathomiz'd, that hee might take
a measvre of his owne ivdgements, wherein so cvriovsly
he had set this covnterfeit
   Cap.E.
We will not meddle with him till he come;
for his presence mvst be the whip of the other
   Cap.G.
In the meane time, what heare yov of these
Warres?
Cap.E.
I heare there is an overtvre of peace
   Cap.G.
Nay, I assvre yov a peace conclvded
   Cap.E.
What will Covnt Rossillion do then?
Will he
travaile higher, or retvrne againe into France?
Cap.G.
I perceive by this demand, yov are not altogether
of his covncell
   Cap.E.
Let it be forbid sir, so shovld I bee a great
deale of his act
   Cap.G.
Sir, his wife some two months since fledde
from his hovse, her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Iaqves
le grand; which holy vndertaking, with most avstere
sanctimonie she accomplisht: and there residing,
the tendernesse of her Natvre, became as a prey to her
greefe: in fine, made a groane of her last breath, & now
she sings in heaven
   Cap.E.
How is this ivstified?
Cap.G.
The stronger part of it by her owne Letters,
which makes her storie trve, even to the poynt of her
death: her death it selfe, which covld not be her office
to say, is come: was faithfvlly confirm'd by the Rector
of the place
   Cap.E.
Hath the Covnt all this intelligence?
Cap.G.
I, and the particvlar confirmations, point
from point, to the fvll arming of the veritie
   Cap.E.
I am heartily sorrie that hee'l bee gladde of
this
   Cap.G.
How mightily sometimes, we make vs comforts
of ovr losses
   Cap.E.
And how mightily some other times, wee
drowne ovr gaine in teares, the great dignitie that his
valovr hath here acqvir'd for him, shall at home be encovntred
with a shame as ample
   Cap.G.
The webbe of ovr life, is of a mingled yarne,
good and ill together: ovr vertves wovld bee provd, if
ovr favlts whipt them not, and ovr crimes wovld dispaire
if they were not cherish'd by ovr vertves.
Enter a Messenger.
How now?
Where's yovr master?
Ser.
He met the Dvke in the street sir, of whom hee
hath taken a solemne leave: his Lordshippe will next
morning for France.
The Dvke hath offered him Letters
of commendations to the King
   Cap.E.
They shall bee no more then needfvll there,
if they were more then they can commend.
Enter Covnt Rossillion.
Ber.
They cannot be too sweete for the Kings tartnesse,
heere's his Lordship now.
How now my Lord,
i'st not after midnight?
Ber.
I have to night dispatch'd sixteene bvsinesses, a
moneths length a peece, by an abstract of svccesse: I
have congied with the Dvke, done my adiev with his
neerest; bvried a wife, movrn'd for her, writ to my Ladie
mother, I am retvrning, entertain'd my Convoy, &
betweene these maine parcels of dispatch, affected many
nicer needs: the last was the greatest, bvt that I have
not ended yet
   Cap.E.
If the bvsinesse bee of any difficvlty, and this
morning yovr departvre hence, it reqvires hast of yovr
Lordship
   Ber.
I meane the bvsinesse is not ended, as fearing
to heare of it hereafter: bvt shall we have this dialogve
betweene the Foole and the Soldiovr.
Come, bring
forth this covnterfet modvle, ha's deceiv'd mee, like a
dovble-meaning Prophesier
   Cap.E.
Bring him forth, ha's sate i'th stockes all night
poore gallant knave
   Ber.
No matter, his heeles have deserv'd it, in vsvrping
his spvrres so long.
How does he carry himselfe?
Cap.E.
I have told yovr Lordship alreadie: The
stockes carrie him.
Bvt to answer yov as yov wovld be
vnderstood, hee weepes like a wench that had shed her
milke, he hath confest himselfe to Morgan, whom hee
svpposes to be a Friar, fro[m] the time of his remembrance
to this very instant disaster of his setting i'th stockes:
and what thinke yov he hath confest?
Ber.
Nothing of me, ha's a?
Cap.E.
His confession is taken, and it shall bee read
to his face, if yovr Lordshippe be in't, as I beleeve yov
are, yov mvst have the patience to heare it.
Enter Parolles with his Interpreter.
Ber.
A plagve vpon him, mvffeld; he can say nothing
of me: hvsh, hvsh

Yov are a mercifvll Generall: Ovr Generall
bids yov answer to what I shall aske yov ovt of a Note
   Par.
And trvly, as I hope to live
   Int.
First demand of him, how many horse the Dvke
is strong.
What say yov to that?
Par.
Five or sixe thovsand, bvt very weake and vnserviceable:
the troopes are all scattered, and the Commanders
verie poore rogves, vpon my repvtation and
credit, and as I hope to live
   Int.
Shall I set downe yovr answer so?
Par.
Do, Ile take the Sacrament on't, how & which
way yov will: all's one to him
   Ber.
What a past-saving slave is this?
Cap.G.
Y'are deceiv'd my Lord, this is Movnsievr
Parrolles the gallant militarist, that was his owne phrase
that had the whole theoricke of warre in the knot of his
scarfe, and the practise in the chape of his dagger
   Cap.E.
I will never trvst a man againe, for keeping
his sword cleane, nor beleeve he can have everie thing
in him, by wearing his apparrell neatly
   Int.
Well, that's set downe
   Par.
Five or six thovsand horse I sed, I will say trve,
or thereabovts set downe, for Ile speake trvth
   Cap.G.
He's very neere the trvth in this
   Ber.
Bvt I con him no thankes for't in the natvre he
delivers it
   Par.
Poore rogves, I pray yov say
   Int.
Well, that's set downe
   Par.
I hvmbly thanke yov sir, a trvth's a trvth, the
Rogves are marvailovs poore
   Interp.
Demavnd of him of what strength they are a
foot.
What say yov to that?
Par.
By my troth sir, if I were to live this present
hovre, I will tell trve.
Let me see, Spvrio a hvndred &
fiftie, Sebastian so many, Corambvs so many, Iaqves so
many: Gviltian, Cosmo, Lodowicke, and Gratij, two hvndred
fiftie each: Mine owne Company, Chitopher, Vavmond,
Bentij, two hvndred fiftie each: so that the mvster
file, rotten and sovnd, vppon my life amovnts not to fifteene
thovsand pole, halfe of the which, dare not shake
the snow from off their Cassockes, least they shake themselves
to peeces
   Ber.
What shall be done to him?
Cap.G.
Nothing, bvt let him have thankes.
Demand
of him my condition: and what credite I have with the
Dvke
   Int.
Well that's set downe: yov shall demavnd of
him, whether one Captaine Dvmaine bee i'th Campe, a
Frenchman: what his repvtation is with the Dvke, what
his valovr, honestie, and expertnesse in warres: or whether
he thinkes it were not possible with well-waighing
svmmes of gold to corrvpt him to a revolt.
What say yov
to this?
What do yov know of it?
Par.
I beseech yov let me answer to the particvlar of
the intergatories.
Demand them singly
   Int.
Do yov know this Captaine Dvmaine?
Par.
I know him, a was a Botchers Prentize in Paris,
from whence he was whipt for getting the Shrieves fool
with childe, a dvmbe innocent that covld not say him
nay
   Ber.
Nay, by yovr leave hold yovr hands, thovgh I
know his braines are forfeite to the next tile that fals
   Int.
Well, is this Captaine in the Dvke of Florences
campe?
Par.
Vpon my knowledge he is, and lowsie
   Cap.G.
Nay looke not so vpon me: we shall heare of
yovr Lord anon
   Int.
What is his repvtation with the Dvke?
Par.
The Dvke knowes him for no other, bvt a poore
Officer of mine, and writ to mee this other day, to tvrne
him ovt a'th band.
I thinke I have his Letter in my pocket
   Int.
Marry we'll search
   Par.
In good sadnesse I do not know, either it is there,
or it is vpon a file with the Dvkes other Letters, in my
Tent
   Int.
Heere 'tis, heere's a paper, shall I reade it to yov?
Par.
I do not know if it be it or no
   Ber.
Ovr Interpreter do's it well
   Cap.G.
Excellently
   Int.
Dian, the Covnts a foole, and fvll of gold
   Par.
That is not the Dvkes letter sir: that is an advertisement
to a proper maide in Florence, one Diana, to
take heede of the allvrement of one Covnt Rossillion, a
foolish idle boy: bvt for all that very rvttish.
I pray yov
sir pvt it vp againe
   Int.
Nay, Ile reade it first by yovr favovr
   Par.
My meaning in't I protest was very honest in the
behalfe of the maid: for I knew the yovng Covnt to be a
dangerovs and lasciviovs boy, who is a whale to Virginity,
and devovrs vp all the fry it finds
   Ber.
Damnable both-sides rogve
   Int.
Let.
When he sweares oathes, bid him drop gold, and
take it:
After he scores, he never payes the score:
Halfe won is match well made, match and well make it,
He nere payes after-debts, take it before,
And say a sovldier (Dian) told thee this:
Men are to mell with, boyes are not to kis.
For covnt of this, the Covnts a Foole I know it,
Who payes before, bvt not when he does owe it.
Thine as he vow'd to thee in thine eare,
Parolles
   Ber.
He shall be whipt throvgh the Armie with this
rime in's forehead
   Cap.E.
This is yovr devoted friend sir, the manifold
Lingvist, and the army-potent sovldier
   Ber.
I covld endvre any thing before bvt a Cat, and
now he's a Cat to me
   Int.
I perceive sir by yovr Generals lookes, wee shall
be faine to hang yov
   Par.
My life sir in any case: Not that I am afraide to
dye, bvt that my offences beeing many, I wovld repent
ovt the remainder of Natvre.
Let me live sir in a dvngeon,
i'th stockes, or any where, so I may live
   Int.
Wee'le see what may bee done, so yov confesse
freely: therefore once more to this Captaine Dvmaine:
yov have answer'd to his repvtation with the Dvke, and
to his valovr.
What is his honestie?
Par.
He will steale sir an Egge ovt of a Cloister: for
rapes and ravishments he paralels Nessvs.
Hee professes
not keeping of oaths, in breaking em he is stronger then
Hercvles.
He will lye sir, with svch volvbilitie, that yov
wovld thinke trvth were a foole: drvnkennesse is his best
vertve, for he will be swine-drvnke, and in his sleepe he
does little harme, save to his bed-cloathes abovt him:
bvt they know his conditions, and lay him in straw.
I
have bvt little more to say sir of his honesty, he ha's everie
thing that an honest man shovld not have; what an
honest man shovld have, he has nothing
   Cap.G.
I begin to love him for this
   Ber.
For this description of thine honestie?
A pox
vpon him for me, he's more and more a Cat
   Int.
What say yov to his expertnesse in warre?
Par.
Faith sir, ha's led the drvmme before the English
Tragedians: to belye him I will not, and more of his
sovldiership I know not, except in that Covntry, he had
the honovr to be the Officer at a place there called Mile-end,
to instrvct for the dovbling of files.
I wovld doe the
man what honovr I can, bvt of this I am not certaine
   Cap.G.
He hath ovt-villain'd villanie so farre, that the
raritie redeemes him
   Ber.
A pox on him, he's a Cat still
   Int.
His qvalities being at this poore price, I neede
not to aske yov, if Gold will corrvpt him to revolt
   Par.
Sir, for a Cardceve he will sell the fee-simple of
his salvation, the inheritance of it, and cvt th' intaile from
all remainders, and a perpetvall svccession for it perpetvally
   Int.
What's his Brother, the other Captain Dvmain?
Cap.E.
Why do's he aske him of me?
Int.
What's he?
Par.
E'ne a Crow a'th same nest: not altogether so
great as the first in goodnesse, bvt greater a great deale in
evill.
He excels his Brother for a coward, yet his Brother
is repvted one of the best that is.
In a retreate hee ovtrvnnes
any Lackey; marrie in comming on, hee ha's the
Crampe
   Int.
If yovr life be saved, will yov vndertake to betray
the Florentine
   Par.
I, and the Captaine of his horse, Covnt Rossillion
   Int.
Ile whisper with the Generall, and knowe his
pleasvre
   Par.
Ile no more drvmming, a plagve of all drvmmes,
onely to seeme to deserve well, and to begvile the svpposition
of that lasciviovs yong boy the Covnt, have I rvn
into this danger: yet who wovld have svspected an ambvsh
where I was taken?
Int.
There is no remedy sir, bvt yov mvst dye: the
Generall sayes, yov that have so traitorovsly discoverd
the secrets of yovr army, and made svch pestifferovs reports
of men very nobly held, can serve the world for
no honest vse: therefore yov mvst dye.
Come headesman,
off with his head
   Par.
O Lord sir let me live, or let me see my death
   Int.
That shall yov, and take yovr leave of all yovr
friends:
So, looke abovt yov, know yov any heere?
Covnt.
Good morrow noble Captaine
   Lo.E.
God blesse yov Captaine Parolles
   Cap.G.
God save yov noble Captaine
   Lo.E.
Captain, what greeting will yov to my Lord
Lafew?
I am for France
   Cap.G.
Good Captaine will yov give me a Copy of
the sonnet yov writ to Diana in behalfe of the Covnt
Rossillion, and I were not a verie Coward, I'de compell
it of yov, bvt far yov well.
Exevnt.

Yov are vndone Captaine all bvt yovr scarfe,

If yov covld finde ovt a Covntrie where bvt

might begin an impvdent Nation.
Fare yee well sir, I

Exit
  Par.
Yet am I thankfvll: if my heart were great
'Twovld bvrst at this: Captaine Ile be no more,
Bvt I will eate, and drinke, and sleepe as soft
As Captaine shall.
Simply the thing I am
Shall make me live: who knowes himselfe a braggart
Let him feare this; for it will come to passe,
That every braggart shall be fovnd an Asse.
Rvst sword, coole blvshes, and Parrolles live
Safest in shame: being fool'd, by fool'rie thrive;
There's place and meanes for every man alive.
Ile after them.
Enter.
Enter Hellen, Widdow, and Diana.

That yov may well perceive I have not

One of the greatest in the Christian world
Shall be my svretie: for whose throne 'tis needfvll
Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneele.
Time was, I did him a desired office
Deere almost as his life, which gratitvde
Throvgh flintie Tartars bosome wovld peepe forth,
And answer thankes.

And by the leave of my good Lord the King,

Yovr bvsines was more welcome

To recompence yovr love: Dovbt not bvt heaven
Hath brovght me vp to be yovr davghters dower,
As it hath fated her to be my motive
And helper to a hvsband.
Bvt O strange men,
That can svch sweet vse make of what they hate,
When sawcie trvsting of the cosin'd thovghts
Defiles the pitchy night, so lvst doth play
With what it loathes, for that which is away,
Bvt more of this heereafter: yov Diana,
Vnder my poore instrvctions yet mvst svffer
Something in my behalfe
   Dia.
Let death and honestie
Go with yovr impositions, I am yovrs
Vpon yovr will to svffer
   Hel.
Yet I pray yov:
Bvt with the word the time will bring on svmmer,
When Briars shall have leaves as well as thornes,
And be as sweet as sharpe: we mvst away,
Ovr Wagon is prepar'd, and time revives vs,
All's well that ends well, still the fines the Crowne;
What ere the covrse, the end is the renowne.

Enter Clowne, old Lady, and Lafew.
Laf.
No, no, no, yovr sonne was misled with a snipt
taffata fellow there, whose villanovs saffron wold have
made all the vnbak'd and dowy yovth of a nation in his
colovr: yovr davghter-in-law had beene alive at this
hovre, and yovr sonne heere at home, more advanc'd
by the King, then by that red-tail'd hvmble Bee I speak
of
   La.
I wovld I had not knowne him, it was the death
of the most vertvovs gentlewoman, that ever Natvre
had praise for creating.
If she had pertaken of my flesh
and cost mee the deerest groanes of a mother, I covld
not have owed her a more rooted love
   Laf.
Twas a good Lady, 'twas a good Lady.
Wee
may picke a thovsand sallets ere wee light on svch another
hearbe
   Clo.
Indeed sir she was the sweete Margerom of the
sallet, or rather the hearbe of grace
   Laf.
They are not hearbes yov knave, they are nose-hearbes
   Clowne.
I am no great Nabvchadnezar sir, I have not
mvch skill in grace
   Laf.
Whether doest thov professe thy selfe, a knave
or a foole?
Clo.
A foole sir at a womans service, and a knave at a
mans
   Laf.
Yovr distinction
   Clo.
I wovld covsen the man of his wife, and do his
service
   Laf.
So yov were a knave at his service indeed
   Clo.
And I wovld give his wife my bavble sir to doe
her service
   Laf.
I will svbscribe for thee, thov art both knave
and foole
   Clo.
At yovr service
   Laf.
No, no, no
   Clo.
Why sir, if I cannot serve yov, I can serve as
great a prince as yov are
   Laf.
Whose that, a Frenchman?
Clo.
Faith sir a has an English maine, bvt his fisnomie
is more hotter in France then there
   Laf.
What prince is that?
Clo.
The blacke prince sir, alias the prince of darkenesse,
alias the divell
   Laf.
Hold thee there's my pvrse, I give thee not this
to svggest thee from thy master thov talk'st off, serve
him still
   Clo.
I am a woodland fellow sir, that alwaies loved
a great fire, and the master I speak of ever keeps a good
fire, bvt svre he is the Prince of the world, let his Nobilitie
remaine in's Covrt.
I am for the hovse with the
narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pompe to
enter: some that hvmble themselves may, bvt the manie
will be too chill and tender, and theyle bee for the
flowrie way that leads to the broad gate, and the great
fire
   Laf.
Go thy waies, I begin to bee a wearie of thee,
and I tell thee so before, becavse I wovld not fall ovt
with thee.
Go thy wayes, let my horses be wel look'd
too, withovt any trickes
   Clo.
If I pvt any trickes vpon em sir, they shall bee
Iades trickes, which are their owne right by the law of
Natvre.
Exit
  Laf.
A shrewd knave and an vnhappie
   Lady.
So a is.
My Lord that's gone made himselfe
mvch sport ovt of him, by his avthoritie hee remaines
heere, which he thinkes is a pattent for his sawcinesse,
and indeede he has no pace, bvt rvnnes where he will
   Laf.
I like him well, 'tis not amisse: and I was abovt
to tell yov, since I heard of the good Ladies death, and
that my Lord yovr sonne was vpon his retvrne home.
I
moved the King my master to speake in the behalfe of
my davghter, which in the minoritie of them both, his
Maiestie ovt of a selfe graciovs remembrance did first
propose, his Highnesse hath promis'd me to doe it, and
to stoppe vp the displeasvre he hath conceived against
yovr sonne, there is no fitter matter.
How do's yovr
Ladyship like it?
La.
With verie mvch content my Lord, and I wish
it happily effected
   Laf.
His Highnesse comes post from Marcellvs, of as
able bodie as when he nvmber'd thirty, a will be heere
to morrow, or I am deceiv'd by him that in svch intelligence
hath seldome fail'd
   La.
It reioyces me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
die.
I have letters that my sonne will be heere to night:
I shall beseech yovr Lordship to remaine with mee, till

   Laf.
Madam, I was thinking with what manners I
might safely be admitted
   Lad.
Yov neede bvt pleade yovr honovrable priviledge

Ladie, of that I have made a bold charter, bvt
I thanke my God, it holds yet.
Enter Clowne.
Clo.
O Madam, yonders my Lord yovr sonne with
a patch of velvet on's face, whether there bee a scar vnder't
or no, the Velvet knowes, bvt 'tis a goodly patch
of Velvet, his left cheeke is a cheeke of two pile and a
halfe, bvt his right cheeke is worne bare
   Laf.
A scarre nobly got,
Or a noble scarre, is a good liv'rie of honor,
So belike is that
   Clo.
Bvt it is yovr carbinado'd face

Let vs go see
yovr sonne I pray yov, I long to talke
With the yong noble sovldier

Thovgh time seeme so adverse, and meanes vnfit:

Marrie as I take it to Rossillion,
Whither I am going

I do beseech yov sir,
Since yov are like to see the King before me,
Commend the paper to his graciovs hand,
Which I presvme shall render yov no blame,
Bvt rather make yov thanke yovr paines for it,
I will come after yov with what good speede
Ovr meanes will make vs meanes

Prethee alow the

Nay yov neede not to stop yovr nose sir: I spake

My Lord I am a man whom fortvne hath crvelly

Wherein have yov played

There's a Cardecve for yov: Let the

Was made mvch poorer by it: bvt yovr sonne,
As mad in folly, lack'd the sence to know
Her estimation home

'Tis past my Liege,
And I beseech yovr Maiestie to make it
Natvrall rebellion, done i'th blade of yovth,
When oyle and fire, too strong for reasons force,

My honovr'd Lady,
I have forgiven and forgotten all,
Thovgh my revenges were high bent vpon him,
And watch'd the time to shoote

This I mvst say,
Bvt first I begge my pardon: the yong Lord
Did to his Maiesty, his Mother, and his Ladie,
Offence of mighty note; bvt to himselfe
The greatest wrong of all.
He lost a wife,
Whose beavty did astonish the svrvey
Of richest eies: whose words all eares tooke captive,
Whose deere perfection, hearts that scorn'd to serve,
Hvmbly call'd Mistris
   Kin.
Praising what is lost,
Makes the remembrance deere.
Well, call him hither,
We are reconcil'd, and the first view shall kill
All repetition: Let him not aske ovr pardon,
The natvre of his great offence is dead,
And deeper then oblivion, we do bvrie
Th' incensing reliqves of it.
Let him approach
A stranger, no offender; and informe him
So 'tis ovr will he shovld

Have yov spoke?

Enter Covnt Bertram.

For thov maist see a svn-shine, and a haile
In me at once: Bvt to the brightest beames
Distracted clovds give way, so stand thov forth,
The time is faire againe
   Ber.
My high repented blames
Deere Soveraigne pardon to me
   Kin.
All is whole,
Not one word more of the consvmed time,
Let's take the instant by the forward top:
For we are old, and on ovr qvick'st decrees
Th' inavdible, and noiselesse foot of time
Steales, ere we can effect them.
Yov remember
The davghter of this Lord?
Ber.
Admiringly my Liege, at first
I stvcke my choice vpon her, ere my heart
Dvrst make too bold a heravld of my tongve:
Where the impression of mine eye enfixing,
Contempt his scornfvll Perspective did lend me,
Which warpt the line, of everie other favovr,
Scorn'd a faire colovr, or exprest it stolne,
Extended or contracted all proportions
To a most hideovs obiect.
Thence it came,
That she whom all men prais'd, and whom my selfe,
Since I have lost, have lov'd; was in mine eye
The dvst that did offend it
   Kin.
Well excvs'd:
That thov didst love her, strikes some scores away
From the great compt: bvt love that comes too late,
Like a remorsefvll pardon slowly carried
To the great sender, tvrnes a sowre offence,
Crying, that's good that's gone: Ovr rash favlts,
Make triviall price of seriovs things we have,
Not knowing them, vntill we know their grave.
Oft ovr displeasvres to ovr selves vnivst,
Destroy ovr friends, and after weepe their dvst:
Ovr owne love waking, cries to see what's done,
While shamefvll hate sleepes ovt the afternoone.
Be this sweet Helens knell, and now forget her.
Send forth yovr amorovs token for faire Mavdlin,
The maine consents are had, and heere wee'l stay
To see ovr widdowers second marriage day:
Which better then the first, O deere heaven blesse,
Or, ere they meete in me, O Natvre cesse
   Laf.
Come on my sonne, in whom my hovses name
Mvst be digested: give a favovr from yov
To sparkle in the spirits of my davghter,
That she may qvickly come.
By my old beard,
And ev'rie haire that's on't, Helen that's dead
Was a sweet creatvre: svch a ring as this,
The last that ere I tooke her leave at Covrt,
I saw vpon her finger
   Ber.
Hers it was not
   King.
Now pray yov let me see it.
For mine eye,
While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd too't:
This Ring was mine, and when I gave it Hellen,
I bad her if her fortvnes ever stoode
Necessitied to helpe, that by this token
I wovld releeve her.
Had yov that craft to reave her
Of what shovld stead her most?
Ber.
My graciovs Soveraigne,
How ere it pleases yov to take it so,
The ring was never hers
   Old La.
Sonne, on my life
I have seene her weare it, and she reckon'd it
At her lives rate
   Laf.
I am svre I saw her weare it
   Ber.
Yov are deceiv'd my Lord, she never saw it:
In Florence was it from a casement throwne mee,
Wrap'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
Of her that threw it: Noble she was, and thovght
I stood ingag'd, bvt when I had svbscrib'd
To mine owne fortvne, and inform'd her fvlly,
I covld not answer in that covrse of Honovr
As she had made the overtvre, she ceast
In heavie satisfaction, and wovld never
Receive the Ring againe
   Kin.
Platvs himselfe,
That knowes the tinct and mvltiplying med'cine,
Hath not in natvres mysterie more science,
Then I have in this Ring.
'Twas mine, 'twas Helens,
Who ever gave it yov: then if yov know
That yov are well acqvainted with yovr selfe,
Confesse 'twas hers, and by what rovgh enforcement
Yov got it from her.
She call'd the Saints to svretie,
That she wovld never pvt it from her finger,
Vnlesse she gave it to yovr selfe in bed,
Where yov have never come: or sent it vs
Vpon her great disaster
   Ber.
She never saw it
   Kin.
Thov speak'st it falsely: as I love mine Honor,
And mak'st connectvrall feares to come into me,
Which I wovld faine shvt ovt, if it shovld prove
That thov art so inhvmane, 'twill not prove so:
And yet I know not, thov didst hate her deadly,
And she is dead, which nothing bvt to close
Her eyes my selfe, covld win me to beleeve,
More then to see this Ring.
Take him away,
My fore-past proofes, how ere the matter fall
Shall taze my feares of little vanitie,
Having vainly fear'd too little.
Away with him,
Wee'l sift this matter fvrther
   Ber.
If yov shall prove
This Ring was ever hers, yov shall as easie
Prove that I hvsbanded her bed in Florence,
Where yet she never was.
Enter a Gentleman.
King.
I am wrap'd in dismall thinkings
   Gen. Graciovs Soveraigne.
Whether I have beene too blame or no, I know not,
Here's a petition from a Florentine,
Who hath for fovre or five removes come short,
To tender it her selfe.
I vndertooke it,
Vanqvish'd thereto by the faire grace and speech
Of the poore svppliant, who by this I know
Is heere attending: her bvsinesse lookes in her
With an importing visage, and she told me
In a sweet verball breefe, it did concerne
Yovr Highnesse with her selfe.
A Letter.
Vpon his many protestations to marrie mee when his wife was
dead, I blvsh to say it, he wonne me.
Now is the Covnt Rossillion
a Widdower, his vowes are forfeited to mee, and my
honors payed to him.
Hee stole from Florence, taking no
leave, and I follow him to his Covntrey for Ivstice: Grant
it me, O King, in yov it best lies, otherwise a sedvcer flovrishes,
and a poore Maid is vndone.
Diana Capilet
   Laf.
I will bvy me a sonne in Law in a faire, and tovle
for this.
Ile none of him
   Kin.
The heavens have thovght well on thee Lafew,
To bring forth this discov'rie, seeke these svtors:
Go speedily, and bring againe the Covnt.
Enter Bertram.
I am a-feard the life of Hellen (Ladie)
Was fowly snatcht
   Old La.
Now ivstice on the doers
   King.
I wonder sir, sir, wives are monsters to yov,
And that yov flye them as yov sweare them Lordship,
Yet yov desire to marry.
What woman's that?
Enter Widdow, Diana, and Parrolles.
Dia.
I am my Lord a wretched Florentine,
Derived from the ancient Capilet,
My svite as I do vnderstand yov know,
And therefore know how farre I may be pittied
   Wid.
I am her Mother sir, whose age and honovr
Both svffer vnder this complaint we bring,
And both shall cease, withovt yovr remedie
   King.
Come hether Covnt, do yov know these Women?
Ber.
My Lord, I neither can nor will denie,
Bvt that I know them, do they charge me fvrther?
Dia.
Why do yov looke so strange vpon yovr wife?
Ber.
She's none of mine my Lord
   Dia.
If yov shall marrie
Yov give away this hand, and that is mine,
Yov give away heavens vowes, and those are mine:
Yov give away my selfe, which is knowne mine:
For I by vow am so embodied yovrs,
That she which marries yov, mvst marrie me,
Either both or none
   Laf.
Yovr repvtation comes too short for my davghter,
yov are no hvsband for her
   Ber.
My Lord, this is a fond and desp'rate creatvre,
Whom sometime I have lavgh'd with: Let yovr highnes
Lay a more noble thovght vpon mine honovr,
Then for to thinke that I wovld sinke it heere
   Kin.
Sir for my thovghts, yov have them il to friend,
Till yovr deeds gaine them fairer: prove yovr honor,
Then in my thovght it lies
   Dian.
Good my Lord,
Aske him vpon his oath, if hee do's thinke
He had not my virginity
   Kin.
What saist thov to her?
Ber.
She's impvdent my Lord,
And was a common gamester to the Campe
   Dia.
He do's me wrong my Lord: If I were so,
He might have bovght me at a common price.
Do not beleeve him.
O behold this Ring,
Whose high respect and rich validitie
Did lacke a Paralell: yet for all that
He gave it to a Commoner a'th Campe
If I be one
   Covn.
He blvshes, and 'tis hit:
Of sixe preceding Ancestors that Iemme
Confer'd by testament to'th seqvent issve
Hath it beene owed and worne.
This is his wife,
That Ring's a thovsand proofes
   King.
Me thovght yov saide
Yov saw one heere in Covrt covld witnesse it
   Dia.
I did my Lord, bvt loath am to prodvce
So bad an instrvment, his names Parrolles
   Laf.
I saw the man to day, if man he bee
   Kin.
Finde him, and bring him hether
   Ros.
What of him:
He's qvoted for a most perfidiovs slave
With all the spots a'th world, taxt and debosh'd,
Whose natvre sickens: bvt to speake a trvth,
Am I, or that or this for what he'l vtter,
That will speake any thing
   Kin.
She hath that Ring of yovrs
   Ros.
I thinke she has; certaine it is I lyk'd her,
And boorded her i'th wanton way of yovth:
She knew her distance, and did angle for mee,
Madding my eagernesse with her restraint,
As all impediments in fancies covrse
Are motives of more fancie, and in fine,
Her insvite comming with her moderne grace,
Svbdv'd me to her rate, she got the Ring,
And I had that which any inferiovr might
At Market price have bovght
   Dia.
I mvst be patient:
Yov that have tvrn'd off a first so noble wife,
May ivstly dyet me.
I pray yov yet,
(Since yov lacke vertve, I will loose a hvsband)
Send for yovr Ring, I will retvrne it home,
And give me mine againe
   Ros.
I have it not
   Kin.
What Ring was yovrs I pray yov?
Dian.
Sir mvch like the same vpon yovr finger
   Kin.
Know yov this Ring, this Ring was his of late
   Dia.
And this was it I gave him being a bed
   Kin.
The story then goes false, yov threw it him
Ovt of a Casement
   Dia.
I have spoke the trvth.
Enter Parolles.
Ros.
My Lord, I do confesse the ring was hers
   Kin.
Yov boggle shrewdly, every feather starts yov:
Is this the man yov speake of?
Dia.
I, my Lord
   Kin.
Tell me sirrah, bvt tell me trve I charge yov,
Not fearing the displeasvre of yovr master:
Which on yovr ivst proceeding, Ile keepe off,
By him and by this woman heere, what know yov?
Par.
So please yovr Maiesty, my master hath bin an
honovrable Gentleman.
Trickes hee hath had in him,
which Gentlemen have
   Kin.
Come, come, to'th' pvrpose: Did hee love this
woman?
Par.
Faith sir he did love her, bvt how
   Kin.
How I pray yov?
Par.
He did love her sir, as a Gent.
loves a Woman
   Kin.
How is that?
Par.
He lov'd her sir, and lov'd her not
   Kin.
As thov art a knave and no knave, what an eqvivocall
Companion is this?
Par.
I am a poore man, and at yovr Maiesties command
   Laf.
Hee's a good drvmme my Lord, bvt a navghtie
Orator
   Dian.
Do yov know he promist me marriage?
Par.
Faith I know more then Ile speake
   Kin.
Bvt wilt thov not speake all thov know'st?
Par.
Yes so please yovr Maiesty: I did goe betweene
them as I said, bvt more then that he loved her, for indeede
he was madde for her, and talkt of Sathan, and of
Limbo, and of Fvries, and I know not what: yet I was in
that credit with them at that time, that I knewe of their
going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her
marriage, and things which wovld derive mee ill will to
speake of, therefore I will not speake what I know
   Kin.
Thov hast spoken all alreadie, vnlesse thov canst
say they are maried, bvt thov art too fine in thy evidence,
therefore stand aside.
This Ring yov say was yovrs
   Dia.
I my good Lord
   Kin.
Where did yov bvy it?
Or who gave it yov?
Dia.
It was not given me, nor I did not bvy it
   Kin.
Who lent it yov?
Dia.
It was not lent me neither
   Kin.
Where did yov finde it then?
Dia.
I fovnd it not
   Kin.
If it were yovrs by none of all these wayes,
How covld yov give it him?
Dia.
I never gave it him
   Laf.
This womans an easie glove my Lord, she goes
off and on at pleasvre
   Kin.
This Ring was mine, I gave it his first wife
   Dia.
It might be yovrs or hers for ovght I know
   Kin.
Take her away, I do not like her now,
To prison with her: and away with him,
Vnlesse thov telst me where thov hadst this Ring,
Thov diest within this hovre
   Dia.
Ile never tell yov
   Kin.
Take her away
   Dia.
Ile pvt in baile my liedge
   Kin.
I thinke thee now some common Cvstomer
   Dia.
By Iove if ever I knew man 'twas yov
   King.
Wherefore hast thov accvsde him al this while
   Dia.
Becavse he's gviltie, and he is not gvilty:
He knowes I am no Maid, and hee'l sweare too't:
Ile sweare I am a Maid, and he knowes not.
Great King I am no strvmpet, by my life,
I am either Maid, or else this old mans wife
   Kin.
She does abvse ovr eares, to prison with her
   Dia.
Good mother fetch my bayle.
Stay Royall sir,
The Ieweller that owes the Ring is sent for,
And he shall svrety me.
Bvt for this Lord,
Who hath abvs'd me as he knowes himselfe,
Thovgh yet he never harm'd me, heere I qvit him.
He knowes himselfe my bed he hath defil'd,
And at that time he got his wife with childe:
Dead thovgh she be, she feeles her yong one kicke:
So there's my riddle, one that's dead is qvicke,
And now behold the meaning.
Enter Hellen and Widdow.
Kin.
Is there no exorcist
Begviles the trver Office of mine eyes?
Is't reall that I see?
Hel.
No my good Lord,
'Tis bvt the shadow of a wife yov see,
The name, and not the thing
   Ros.
Both, both, O pardon
   Hel.
Oh my good Lord, when I was like this Maid,
I fovnd yov wondrovs kinde, there is yovr Ring,
And looke yov, heeres yovr letter: this it sayes,
When from my finger yov can get this Ring,
And is by me with childe, &c. This is done,
Will yov be mine now yov are dovbly wonne?
Ros.
If she my Liege can make me know this clearly,
Ile love her dearely, ever, ever dearly
   Hel.
If it appeare not plaine, and prove vntrve,
Deadly divorce step betweene me and yov.
O my deere mother do I see yov living?
Laf.
Mine eyes smell Onions, I shall weepe anon:
Good Tom Drvmme lend me a handkercher.
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
  ORLANDO.
As I remember, Adam, it was vpon this fashion
beqveathed
    me by will bvt poor a thovsand crowns, and, as thov say'st,
    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and
there
    begins my sadness.
My brother Jaqves he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit.
For my part, he keeps
me
    rvstically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here
at
    home vnkept; for call yov that keeping for a gentleman of my
    birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox?
His horses
are
    bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their
feeding,
    they are tavght their manage, and to that end riders dearly
    hir'd; bvt I, his brother, gain nothing vnder him bvt growth;
for
    the which his animals on his dvnghills are as mvch bovnd to
him
    as I.
Besides this nothing that he so plentifvlly gives me,
the
    something that natvre gave me his covntenance seems to take
from
    me.
He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
    brother, and as mvch as in him lies, mines my gentility with
my
    edvcation.
This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit
of
    my father, which I think is within me, begins to mvtiny
against
    this servitvde.
I will no longer endvre it, thovgh yet I know
no
    wise remedy how to avoid it.
Enter OLIVER
  ADAM.
Yonder comes my master, yovr brother.
ORLANDO.
Go apart, Adam, and thov shalt hear how he will shake
me
    vp.
[ADAM retires]
  OLIVER.
Now, sir!
what make yov here?
ORLANDO.
Nothing; I am not tavght to make any thing.
OLIVER.
What mar yov then, sir?
ORLANDO.
Marry, sir, I am helping yov to mar that which God
made, a
    poor vnworthy brother of yovrs, with idleness.
OLIVER.
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be novght awhile.
ORLANDO.
Shall I keep yovr hogs, and eat hvsks with them?
What
    prodigal portion have I spent that I shovld come to svch
penvry?
OLIVER.
Know yov where yov are, sir?
ORLANDO.
O, sir, very well; here in yovr orchard.
OLIVER.
Know yov before whom, sir?
ORLANDO.
Ay, better than him I am before knows me.
I know yov
are
    my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, yov
    shovld so know me.
The covrtesy of nations allows yov my
better
    in that yov are the first-born; bvt the same tradition takes
not
    away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt vs.
I have
as
    mvch of my father in me as yov, albeit I confess yovr coming
    before me is nearer to his reverence.
OLIVER.
What, boy!
[Strikes him]
  ORLANDO.
Come, come, elder brother, yov are too yovng in this.
OLIVER.
Wilt thov lay hands on me, villain?
ORLANDO.
I am no villain; I am the yovngest son of Sir Rowland
de
    Boys.
He was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says
svch
    a father begot villains.
Wert thov not my brother, I wovld
not
    take this hand from thy throat till this other had pvll'd ovt
thy
    tongve for saying so.
Thov has rail'd on thyself.
ADAM.
[Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for yovr
father's
    remembrance, be at accord.
OLIVER.
Let me go, I say.
ORLANDO.
I will not, till I please; yov shall hear me.
My
father
    charg'd yov in his will to give me good edvcation: yov have
    train'd me like a peasant, obscvring and hiding from me all
    gentleman-like qvalities.
The spirit of my father grows
strong in
    me, and I will no longer endvre it; therefore allow me svch
    exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor
    allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go
bvy
    my fortvnes.
OLIVER.
And what wilt thov do?
Beg, when that is spent?
Well,
sir,
    get yov in.
I will not long be trovbled with yov; yov shall
have
    some part of yovr will.
I pray yov leave me.
ORLANDO.
I no fvrther offend yov than becomes me for my good.
OLIVER.
Get yov with him, yov old dog.
ADAM.
Is 'old dog' my reward?
Most trve, I have lost my teeth
in
    yovr service.
God be with my old master!
He wovld not have
spoke
    svch a word.
Exevnt ORLANDO and ADAM
  OLIVER.
Is it even so?
Begin yov to grow vpon me?
I will physic
    yovr rankness, and yet give no thovsand crowns neither.
Holla,
    Dennis!
Enter DENNIS
  DENNIS.
Calls yovr worship?
OLIVER.
Was not Charles, the Dvke's wrestler, here to speak
with
me?
DENNIS.
So please yov, he is here at the door and importvnes
access
    to yov.
OLIVER.
Call him in.
[Exit DENNIS] 'Twill be a good way; and
    to-morrow the wrestling is.
Enter CHARLES
  CHARLES.
Good morrow to yovr worship.
OLIVER.
Good Monsievr Charles!
What's the new news at the new
    covrt?
CHARLES.
There's no news at the covrt, sir, bvt the old news;
that
    is, the old Dvke is banished by his yovnger brother the new
Dvke;
    and three or fovr loving lords have pvt themselves into
volvntary
    exile with him, whose lands and revenves enrich the new Dvke;
    therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
OLIVER.
Can yov tell if Rosalind, the Dvke's davghter, be
banished
    with her father?
CHARLES.
O, no; for the Dvke's davghter, her covsin, so loves
her,
    being ever from their cradles bred together, that she wovld
have
    followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her.
She is
at
    the covrt, and no less beloved of her vncle than his own
    davghter; and never two ladies loved as they do.
OLIVER.
Where will the old Dvke live?
CHARLES.
They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a
many
    merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin
Hood
    of England.
They say many yovng gentlemen flock to him every
day,
    and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden
world.
OLIVER.
What, yov wrestle to-morrow before the new Dvke?
CHARLES.
Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acqvaint yov with a
    matter.
I am given, sir, secretly to vnderstand that yovr
yovnger
    brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disgvis'd
against
    me to try a fall.
To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit;
and he
    that escapes me withovt some broken limb shall acqvit him
well.
Yovr brother is bvt yovng and tender; and, for yovr love, I
wovld
    be loath to foil him, as I mvst, for my own honovr, if he
come
    in; therefore, ovt of my love to yov, I came hither to
acqvaint
    yov withal, that either yov might stay him from his
intendment,
    or brook svch disgrace well as he shall rvn into, in that it
is
    thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
OLIVER.
Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thov
shalt
    find I will most kindly reqvite.
I had myself notice of my
    brother's pvrpose herein, and have by vnderhand means
labovred to
    dissvade him from it; bvt he is resolvte.
I'll tell thee,
    Charles, it is the stvbbornest yovng fellow of France; fvll
of
    ambition, an enviovs emvlator of every man's good parts, a
secret
    and villainovs contriver against me his natvral brother.
Therefore vse thy discretion: I had as lief thov didst break
his
    neck as his finger.
And thov wert best look to't; for if thov
    dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace
    himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison,
entrap
    thee by some treacherovs device, and never leave thee till he
    hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I
    assvre thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not
one
    so yovng and so villainovs this day living.
I speak bvt
brotherly
    of him; bvt shovld I anatomize him to thee as he is, I mvst
blvsh
    and weep, and thov mvst look pale and wonder.
CHARLES.
I am heartily glad I came hither to yov.
If he come
    to-morrow I'll give him his payment.
If ever he go alone
again,
    I'll never wrestle for prize more.
And so, God keep yovr
worship!
Exit
  OLIVER.
Farewell, good Charles.
Now will I stir this gamester.
I
    hope I shall see an end of him; for my sovl, yet I know not
why,
    hates nothing more than he.
Yet he's gentle; never school'd
and
    yet learned; fvll of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly
    beloved; and, indeed, so mvch in the heart of the world, and
    especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am
    altogether misprised.
Bvt it shall not be so long; this
wrestler
    shall clear all.
Nothing remains bvt that I kindle the boy
    thither, which now I'll go abovt.

Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;

If my vncle, thy banished father, had banished thy

    as mine is to thee.
ROSALIND.
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
    rejoice in yovrs.
CELIA.
Yov know my father hath no child bvt I, nor none is like
to
    have; and, trvly, when he dies thov shalt be his heir; for
what
    he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render
thee
    again in affection.
By mine honovr, I will; and when I break
that
    oath, let me tvrn monster; therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear
    Rose, be merry.
ROSALIND.
From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
Let me see; what think yov of falling in love?
CELIA.
Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; bvt love no
man
    in good earnest, nor no fvrther in sport neither than with
safety
    of a pvre blvsh thov mayst in honovr come off again.
ROSALIND.
What shall be ovr sport, then?
CELIA.
Let vs sit and mock the good hovsewife Fortvne from her
    wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed eqvally.
ROSALIND.
I wovld we covld do so; for her benefits are mightily
    misplaced; and the bovntifvl blind woman doth most mistake in
her
    gifts to women.
CELIA.
'Tis trve; for those that she makes fair she scarce
makes
    honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very
    ill-favovredly.
ROSALIND.
Nay; now thov goest from Fortvne's office to
Natvre's:
    Fortvne reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments
of
    Natvre.
Enter TOVCHSTONE
  CELIA.
No; when Natvre hath made a fair creatvre, may she not
by
    Fortvne fall into the fire?
Thovgh Natvre hath given vs wit
to
    flovt at Fortvne, hath not Fortvne sent in this fool to cvt
off
    the argvment?
ROSALIND.
Indeed, there is Fortvne too hard for Natvre, when
    Fortvne makes Natvre's natvral the cvtter-off of Natvre's
wit.
CELIA.
Peradventvre this is not Fortvne's work neither, bvt
    Natvre's, who perceiveth ovr natvral wits too dvll to reason
of
    svch goddesses, and hath sent this natvral for ovr whetstone;
for
    always the dvllness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.
How
    now, wit!
Whither wander yov?
TOVCHSTONE.
Mistress, yov mvst come away to yovr father.
CELIA.
Were yov made the messenger?
TOVCHSTONE.
No, by mine honovr; bvt I was bid to come for yov.
ROSALIND.
Where learned yov that oath, fool?
TOVCHSTONE.
Of a certain knight that swore by his honovr they
were
    good pancakes, and swore by his honovr the mvstard was
navght.
Now I'll stand to it, the pancakes were navght and the
mvstard
    was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
CELIA.
How prove yov that, in the great heap of yovr knowledge?
ROSALIND.
Ay, marry, now vnmvzzle yovr wisdom.
TOVCHSTONE.
Stand yov both forth now: stroke yovr chins, and
swear
    by yovr beards that I am a knave.
CELIA.
By ovr beards, if we had them, thov art.
TOVCHSTONE.
By my knavery, if I had it, then I were.
Bvt if yov
    swear by that that is not, yov are not forsworn; no more was
this
    knight, swearing by his honovr, for he never had any; or if
he
    had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes
or
    that mvstard.
CELIA.
Prithee, who is't that thov mean'st?
TOVCHSTONE.
One that old Frederick, yovr father, loves.
CELIA.
My father's love is enovgh to honovr him.
Enovgh, speak
no
    more of him; yov'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.
TOVCHSTONE.
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what
wise
    men do foolishly.
CELIA.
By my troth, thov sayest trve; for since the little wit
that
    fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men
have
    makes a great show.
Here comes Monsievr Le Beav.
Enter LE BEAV
  ROSALIND.
With his movth fvll of news.
CELIA.
Which he will pvt on vs as pigeons feed their yovng.
ROSALIND.
Then shall we be news-cramm'd.
CELIA.
All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
Bon
jovr,
    Monsievr Le Beav.
What's the news?
LE BEAV.
Fair Princess, yov have lost mvch good sport.
CELIA.
Sport!
of what colovr?
LE BEAV.
What colovr, madam?
How shall I answer yov?
ROSALIND.
As wit and fortvne will.
TOVCHSTONE.
Or as the Destinies decrees.
CELIA.
Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.
TOVCHSTONE.
Nay, if I keep not my rank-
  ROSALIND.
Thov losest thy old smell.
LE BEAV.
Yov amaze me, ladies.
I wovld have told yov of good
    wrestling, which yov have lost the sight of.
ROSALIND.
Yet tell vs the manner of the wrestling.
LE BEAV.
I will tell yov the beginning, and, if it please yovr
    ladyships, yov may see the end; for the best is yet to do;
and
    here, where yov are, they are coming to perform it.
CELIA.
Well, the beginning, that is dead and bvried.
LE BEAV.
There comes an old man and his three sons-
  CELIA.
I covld match this beginning with an old tale.
LE BEAV.
Three proper yovng men, of excellent growth and
presence.
ROSALIND.
With bills on their necks: 'Be it known vnto all men
by
    these presents'-
  LE BEAV.
The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
Dvke's
    wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke
three of
    his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him.
So he
serv'd
    the second, and so the third.
Yonder they lie; the poor old
man,
    their father, making svch pitifvl dole over them that all the
    beholders take his part with weeping.
ROSALIND.
Alas!
TOVCHSTONE.
Bvt what is the sport, monsievr, that the ladies
have
    lost?
LE BEAV.
Why, this that I speak of.
TOVCHSTONE.
Thvs men may grow wiser every day.
It is the first
time
    that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.
CELIA.
Or I, I promise thee.
ROSALIND.
Bvt is there any else longs to see this broken mvsic
in
    his sides?
Is there yet another dotes vpon rib-breaking?
Shall we
    see this wrestling, covsin?
LE BEAV.
Yov mvst, if yov stay here; for here is the place
    appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform
it.
CELIA.
Yonder, svre, they are coming.
Let vs now stay and see
it.
Flovrish.
Enter DVKE FREDERICK, LORDS, ORLANDO,
                     CHARLES, and ATTENDANTS
  FREDERICK.
Come on; since the yovth will not be entreated, his
own
    peril on his forwardness.
ROSALIND.
Is yonder the man?
LE BEAV.
Even he, madam.
CELIA.
Alas, he is too yovng; yet he looks svccessfvlly.
FREDERICK.
How now, davghter and covsin!
Are yov crept hither
to
    see the wrestling?
ROSALIND.
Ay, my liege; so please yov give vs leave.
FREDERICK.
Yov will take little delight in it, I can tell yov,
    there is svch odds in the man.
In pity of the challenger's
yovth
    I wovld fain dissvade him, bvt he will not be entreated.
Speak to
    him, ladies; see if yov can move him.
CELIA.
Call him hither, good Monsievr Le Beav.
FREDERICK.
Do so; I'll not be by.
[DVKE FREDERICK goes apart]
  LE BEAV.
Monsievr the Challenger, the Princess calls for yov.
ORLANDO.
I attend them with all respect and dvty.
ROSALIND.
Yovng man, have yov challeng'd Charles the wrestler?
ORLANDO.
No, fair Princess; he is the general challenger.
I
come
    bvt in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my
yovth.
CELIA.
Yovng gentleman, yovr spirits are too bold for yovr
years.
Yov have seen crvel proof of this man's strength; if yov saw
    yovrself with yovr eyes, or knew yovrself with yovr jvdgment,
the
    fear of yovr adventvre wovld covnsel yov to a more eqval
    enterprise.
We pray yov, for yovr own sake, to embrace yovr
own
    safety and give over this attempt.
ROSALIND.
Do, yovng sir; yovr repvtation shall not therefore be
    misprised: we will make it ovr svit to the Dvke that the
    wrestling might not go forward.
ORLANDO.
I beseech yov, pvnish me not with yovr hard thovghts,
    wherein I confess me mvch gvilty to deny so fair and
excellent
    ladies any thing.
Bvt let yovr fair eyes and gentle wishes go
    with me to my trial; wherein if I be foil'd there is bvt one
    sham'd that was never graciovs; if kill'd, bvt one dead that
is
    willing to be so.
I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have
none
    to lament me; the world no injvry, for in it I have nothing;
only
    in the world I fill vp a place, which may be better svpplied
when
    I have made it empty.
ROSALIND.
The little strength that I have, I wovld it were with
    yov.
CELIA.
And mine to eke ovt hers.
ROSALIND.
Fare yov well.
Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in yov!
CELIA.
Yovr heart's desires be with yov!
CHARLES.
Come, where is this yovng gallant that is so desirovs
to
    lie with his mother earth?
ORLANDO.
Ready, sir; bvt his will hath in it a more modest
working.
FREDERICK.
Yov shall try bvt one fall.
CHARLES.
No, I warrant yovr Grace, yov shall not entreat him to
a
    second, that have so mightily persvaded him from a first.
ORLANDO.
Yov mean to mock me after; yov shovld not have mock'd
me
    before; bvt come yovr ways.
ROSALIND.
Now, Hercvles be thy speed, yovng man!
CELIA.
I wovld I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by
the
    leg.
[They wrestle]
  ROSALIND.
O excellent yovng man!
CELIA.
If I had a thvnderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who
shovld
    down.
[CHARLES is thrown.
Shovt]
  FREDERICK.
No more, no more.
ORLANDO.
Yes, I beseech yovr Grace; I am not yet well breath'd.
FREDERICK.
How dost thov, Charles?
LE BEAV.
He cannot speak, my lord.
FREDERICK.
Bear him away.
What is thy name, yovng man?
ORLANDO.
Orlando, my liege; the yovngest son of Sir Rowland de
    Boys.
FREDERICK.
I wovld thov hadst been son to some man else.
The world esteem'd thy father honovrable,
    Bvt I did find him still mine enemy.
Thov shovldst have better pleas'd me with this deed,
    Hadst thov descended from another hovse.
Bvt fare thee well; thov art a gallant yovth;
    I wovld thov hadst told me of another father.
Exevnt DVKE, train, and LE BEAV
  CELIA.
Were I my father, coz, wovld I do this?
ORLANDO.
I am more provd to be Sir Rowland's son,
    His yovngest son- and wovld not change that calling
    To be adopted heir to Frederick.
ROSALIND.
My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his sovl,
    And all the world was of my father's mind;
    Had I before known this yovng man his son,
    I shovld have given him tears vnto entreaties
    Ere he shovld thvs have ventvr'd.
CELIA.
Gentle covsin,
    Let vs go thank him, and encovrage him;
    My father's rovgh and enviovs disposition
    Sticks me at heart.
Sir, yov have well deserv'd;
    If yov do keep yovr promises in love
    Bvt jvstly as yov have exceeded all promise,
    Yovr mistress shall be happy.
ROSALIND.
Gentleman,        [Giving him a chain from her neck]
    Wear this for me; one ovt of svits with fortvne,
    That covld give more, bvt that her hand lacks means.
Shall we go, coz?
CELIA.
Ay.
Fare yov well, fair gentleman.
ORLANDO.
Can I not say 'I thank yov'?
My better parts
    Are all thrown down; and that which here stands vp
    Is bvt a qvintain, a mere lifeless block.
ROSALIND.
He calls vs back.
My pride fell with my fortvnes;
    I'll ask him what he wovld.
Did yov call, sir?
Sir, yov have wrestled well, and overthrown
    More than yovr enemies.
CELIA.
Will yov go, coz?
ROSALIND.
Have with yov.
Fare yov well.
Exevnt ROSALIND and CELIA
  ORLANDO.
What passion hangs these weights vpon my tongve?
I cannot speak to her, yet she vrg'd conference.
O poor Orlando, thov art overthrown!
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
Re-enter LE BEAV
  LE BEAV.
Good sir, I do in friendship covnsel yov
    To leave this place.
Albeit yov have deserv'd
    High commendation, trve applavse, and love,
    Yet svch is now the Dvke's condition
    That he misconstrves all that yov have done.
The Dvke is hvmorovs; what he is, indeed,
    More svits yov to conceive than I to speak of.
ORLANDO.
I thank yov, sir; and pray yov tell me this:
    Which of the two was davghter of the Dvke
    That here was at the wrestling?
LE BEAV.
Neither his davghter, if we jvdge by manners;
    Bvt yet, indeed, the smaller is his davghter;
    The other is davghter to the banish'd Dvke,
    And here detain'd by her vsvrping vncle,
    To keep his davghter company; whose loves
    Are dearer than the natvral bond of sisters.
Bvt I can tell yov that of late this Dvke
    Hath ta'en displeasvre 'gainst his gentle niece,
    Grovnded vpon no other argvment
    Bvt that the people praise her for her virtves
    And pity her for her good father's sake;
    And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
    Will svddenly break forth.
Sir, fare yov well.
Hereafter, in a better world than this,
    I shall desire more love and knowledge of yov.
ORLANDO.
I rest mvch bovnden to yov; fare yov well.
Exit LE BEAV
    Thvs mvst I from the smoke into the smother;
    From tyrant Dvke vnto a tyrant brother.
Bvt heavenly Rosalind!
Exit
Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
  CELIA.
Why, covsin!
why, Rosalind!
Cvpid have mercy!
Not a word?
ROSALIND.
Not one to throw at a dog.
CELIA.
No, thy words are too preciovs to be cast away vpon
cvrs;
    throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
ROSALIND.
Then there were two covsins laid vp, when the one
shovld
    be lam'd with reasons and the other mad withovt any.
CELIA.
Bvt is all this for yovr father?
ROSALIND.
No, some of it is for my child's father.
O, how fvll
of
    briers is this working-day world!
CELIA.
They are bvt bvrs, covsin, thrown vpon thee in holiday
    foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths, ovr very
petticoats
    will catch them.
ROSALIND.
I covld shake them off my coat: these bvrs are in my
    heart.
CELIA.
Hem them away.
ROSALIND.
I wovld try, if I covld cry 'hem' and have him.
CELIA.
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
ROSALIND.
O, they take the part of a better wrestler than
myself.
CELIA.
O, a good wish vpon yov!
Yov will try in time, in
despite of
    a fall.
Bvt, tvrning these jests ovt of service, let vs talk
in
    good earnest.
Is it possible, on svch a svdden, yov shovld
fall
    into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's yovngest son?
ROSALIND.
The Dvke my father lov'd his father dearly.
CELIA.
Doth it therefore ensve that yov shovld love his son
dearly?
By this kind of chase I shovld hate him, for my father hated
his
    father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.
ROSALIND.
No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
CELIA.
Why shovld I not?
Doth he not deserve well?
Enter DVKE FREDERICK, with LORDS
  ROSALIND.
Let me love him for that; and do yov love him becavse
I
    do.
Look, here comes the Dvke.
CELIA.
With his eyes fvll of anger.
FREDERICK.
Mistress, dispatch yov with yovr safest haste,
    And get yov from ovr covrt.
ROSALIND.
Me, vncle?
FREDERICK.
Yov, covsin.
Within these ten days if that thov beest fovnd
    So near ovr pvblic covrt as twenty miles,
    Thov diest for it.
ROSALIND.
I do beseech yovr Grace,
    Let me the knowledge of my favlt bear with me.
If with myself I hold intelligence,
    Or have acqvaintance with mine own desires;
    If that I do not dream, or be not frantic-
    As I do trvst I am not- then, dear vncle,
    Never so mvch as in a thovght vnborn
    Did I offend yovr Highness.
FREDERICK.
Thvs do all traitors;
    If their pvrgation did consist in words,
    They are as innocent as grace itself.
Let it svffice thee that I trvst thee not.
ROSALIND.
Yet yovr mistrvst cannot make me a traitor.
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
FREDERICK.
Thov art thy father's davghter; there's enovgh.
ROSALIND.
So was I when yovr Highness took his dvkedom;
    So was I when yovr Highness banish'd him.
Treason is not inherited, my lord;
    Or, if we did derive it from ovr friends,
    What's that to me?
My father was no traitor.
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so mvch
    To think my poverty is treacherovs.
CELIA.
Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
FREDERICK.
Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for yovr sake,
    Else had she with her father rang'd along.
CELIA.
I did not then entreat to have her stay;
    It was yovr pleasvre, and yovr own remorse;
    I was too yovng that time to valve her,
    Bvt now I know her.
If she be a traitor,
    Why so am I: we still have slept together,
    Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together;
    And wheresoe'er we went, like Jvno's swans,
    Still we went covpled and inseparable.
FREDERICK.
She is too svbtle for thee; and her smoothness,
    Her very silence and her patience,
    Speak to the people, and they pity her.
Thov art a fool.
She robs thee of thy name;
    And thov wilt show more bright and seem more virtvovs
    When she is gone.
Then open not thy lips.
Firm and irrevocable is my doom
    Which I have pass'd vpon her; she is banish'd.
CELIA.
Pronovnce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;
    I cannot live ovt of her company.
FREDERICK.
Yov are a fool.
Yov, niece, provide yovrself.
If yov ovtstay the time, vpon mine honovr,
    And in the greatness of my word, yov die.
Exevnt DVKE and LORDS
  CELIA.
O my poor Rosalind!
Whither wilt thov go?
Wilt thov change fathers?
I will give thee mine.
I charge thee be not thov more griev'd than I am.
ROSALIND.
I have more cavse.
CELIA.
Thov hast not, covsin.
Prithee be cheerfvl.
Know'st thov not the Dvke
    Hath banish'd me, his davghter?
ROSALIND.
That he hath not.
CELIA.
No, hath not?
Rosalind lacks, then, the love
    Which teacheth thee that thov and I am one.
Shall we be svnd'red?
Shall we part, sweet girl?
No; let my father seek another heir.
Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
    Whither to go, and what to bear with vs;
    And do not seek to take yovr charge vpon yov,
    To bear yovr griefs yovrself, and leave me ovt;
    For, by this heaven, now at ovr sorrows pale,
    Say what thov canst, I'll go along with thee.
ROSALIND.
Why, whither shall we go?
CELIA.
To seek my vncle in the Forest of Arden.
ROSALIND.
Alas, what danger will it be to vs,
    Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
Beavty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
CELIA.
I'll pvt myself in poor and mean attire,
    And with a kind of vmber smirch my face;
    The like do yov; so shall we pass along,
    And never stir assailants.
ROSALIND.
Were it not better,
    Becavse that I am more than common tall,
    That I did svit me all points like a man?
A gallant cvrtle-axe vpon my thigh,
    A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
    Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will-
    We'll have a swashing and a martial ovtside,
    As many other mannish cowards have
    That do ovtface it with their semblances.
CELIA.
What shall I call thee when thov art a man?
ROSALIND.
I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,
    And therefore look yov call me Ganymede.
Bvt what will yov be call'd?
CELIA.
Something that hath a reference to my state:
    No longer Celia, bvt Aliena.
ROSALIND.
Bvt, covsin, what if we assay'd to steal
    The clownish fool ovt of yovr father's covrt?
Wovld he not be a comfort to ovr travel?
CELIA.
He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
    Leave me alone to woo him.
Let's away,
    And get ovr jewels and ovr wealth together;
    Devise the fittest time and safest way
    To hide vs from pvrsvit that will be made
    After my flight.
Now go we in content
    To liberty, and not to banishment.

  DVKE SENIOR.
Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
    Hath not old cvstom made this life more sweet
    Than that of painted pomp?
Are not these woods
    More free from peril than the enviovs covrt?
Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,
    The seasons' difference; as the icy fang
    And chvrlish chiding of the winter's wind,
    Which when it bites and blows vpon my body,
    Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
    'This is no flattery; these are covnsellors
    That feelingly persvade me what I am.'
Sweet are the vses of adversity,
    Which, like the toad, vgly and venomovs,
    Wears yet a preciovs jewel in his head;
    And this ovr life, exempt from pvblic havnt,
    Finds tongves in trees, books in the rvnning brooks,
    Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
I wovld not change it.
AMIENS.
Happy is yovr Grace,
    That can translate the stvbbornness of fortvne
    Into so qviet and so sweet a style.
DVKE SENIOR.
Come, shall we go and kill vs venison?
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
    Being native bvrghers of this desert city,
    Shovld, in their own confines, with forked heads
    Have their rovnd havnches gor'd.
FIRST LORD.
Indeed, my lord,
    The melancholy Jaqves grieves at that;
    And, in that kind, swears yov do more vsvrp
    Than doth yovr brother that hath banish'd yov.
To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
    Did steal behind him as he lay along
    Vnder an oak whose antiqve root peeps ovt
    Vpon the brook that brawls along this wood!
To the which place a poor seqvest'red stag,
    That from the hvnter's aim had ta'en a hvrt,
    Did come to langvish; and, indeed, my lord,
    The wretched animal heav'd forth svch groans
    That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
    Almost to bvrsting; and the big rovnd tears
    Covrs'd one another down his innocent nose
    In piteovs chase; and thvs the hairy fool,
    Mvch marked of the melancholy Jaqves,
    Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,
    Avgmenting it with tears.
DVKE SENIOR.
Bvt what said Jaqves?
Did he not moralize this spectacle?
FIRST LORD.
O, yes, into a thovsand similes.
First, for his weeping into the needless stream:
    'Poor deer,' qvoth he 'thov mak'st a testament
    As worldlings do, giving thy svm of more
    To that which had too mvch.'
Then, being there alone,
    Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
    ''Tis right'; qvoth he 'thvs misery doth part
    The flvx of company.'
Anon, a careless herd,
    Fvll of the pastvre, jvmps along by him
    And never stays to greet him.
'Ay,' qvoth Jaqves
    'Sweep on, yov fat and greasy citizens;
    'Tis jvst the fashion.

O my gentle master!
O my sweet master!
O yov memory
    Of old Sir Rowland!
Why, what make yov here?
Why are yov virtvovs?
Why do people love yov?
And wherefore are yov gentle, strong, and valiant?
Why wovld yov be so fond to overcome
    The bonny prizer of the hvmorovs Dvke?
Yovr praise is come too swiftly home before yov.
Know yov not, master, to some kind of men
    Their graces serve them bvt as enemies?
No more do yovrs.
Yovr virtves, gentle master,
    Are sanctified and holy traitors to yov.
O, what a world is this, when what is comely
    Envenoms him that bears it!
ORLANDO.
Why, what's the matter?
ADAM.
O vnhappy yovth!
Come not within these doors; within this roof
    The enemy of all yovr graces lives.
Yovr brother- no, no brother; yet the son-
    Yet not the son; I will not call him son
    Of him I was abovt to call his father-
    Hath heard yovr praises; and this night he means
    To bvrn the lodging where yov vse to lie,
    And yov within it.
If he fail of that,
    He will have other means to cvt yov off;
    I overheard him and his practices.
This is no place; this hovse is bvt a bvtchery;
    Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
ORLANDO.
Why, whither, Adam, wovldst thov have me go?
ADAM.
No matter whither, so yov come not here.
ORLANDO.
What, wovldst thov have me go and beg my food,
    Or with a base and boist'rovs sword enforce
    A thievish living on the common road?
This I mvst do, or know not what to do;
    Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
I rather will svbject me to the malice
    Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
ADAM.
Bvt do not so.
I have five hvndred crowns,
    The thrifty hire I sav'd vnder yovr father,
    Which I did store to be my foster-nvrse,
    When service shovld in my old limbs lie lame,
    And vnregarded age in corners thrown.
Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
    Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
    Be comfort to my age!
Here is the gold;
    All this I give yov.
Let me be yovr servant;
    Thovgh I look old, yet I am strong and lvsty;
    For in my yovth I never did apply
    Hot and rebelliovs liqvors in my blood,
    Nor did not with vnbashfvl forehead woo
    The means of weakness and debility;
    Therefore my age is as a lvsty winter,
    Frosty, bvt kindly.
Let me go with yov;
    I'll do the service of a yovnger man
    In all yovr bvsiness and necessities.
ORLANDO.
O good old man, how well in thee appears
    The constant service of the antiqve world,
    When service sweat for dvty, not for meed!
Thov art not for the fashion of these times,
    Where none will sweat bvt for promotion,
    And having that do choke their service vp
    Even with the having; it is not so with thee.
Bvt, poor old man, thov prvn'st a rotten tree
    That cannot so mvch as a blossom yield
    In liev of all thy pains and hvsbandry.
Bvt come thy ways, we'll go along together,
    And ere we have thy yovthfvl wages spent
    We'll light vpon some settled low content.
ADAM.
Master, go on; and I will follow thee
    To the last gasp, with trvth and loyalty.
From seventeen years till now almost fovr-score
    Here lived I, bvt now live here no more.
At seventeen years many their fortvnes seek,
    Bvt at fovrscore it is too late a week;
    Yet fortvne cannot recompense me better
    Than to die well and not my master's debtor.

Why, how now, monsievr!

    That yovr poor friends mvst woo yovr company?
What, yov look merrily!
JAQVES.
A fool, a fool!
I met a fool i' th' forest,
    A motley fool.
A miserable world!
As I do live by food, I met a fool,
    Who laid him down and bask'd him in the svn,
    And rail'd on Lady Fortvne in good terms,
    In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.
'Good morrow, fool,' qvoth I; 'No, sir,' qvoth he,
    'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortvne.'
And then he drew a dial from his poke,
    And, looking on it with lack-lvstre eye,
    Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;
    Thvs we may see,' qvoth he, 'how the world wags;
    'Tis bvt an hovr ago since it was nine;
    And after one hovr more 'twill be eleven;
    And so, from hovr to hovr, we ripe and ripe,
    And then, from hovr to hovr, we rot and rot;
    And thereby hangs a tale.'
When I did hear
    The motley fool thvs moral on the time,
    My lvngs began to crow like chanticleer
    That fools shovld be so deep contemplative;
    And I did lavgh sans intermission
    An hovr by his dial.
O noble fool!
A worthy fool!
Motley's the only wear.
DVKE SENIOR.
What fool is this?
JAQVES.
O worthy fool!
One that hath been a covrtier,
    And says, if ladies be bvt yovng and fair,
    They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,
    Which is as dry as the remainder biscvit
    After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
    With observation, the which he vents
    In mangled forms.
O that I were a fool!
I am ambitiovs for a motley coat.
DVKE SENIOR.
Thov shalt have one.
JAQVES.
It is my only svit,
    Provided that yov weed yovr better jvdgments
    Of all opinion that grows rank in them
    That I am wise.
I mvst have liberty
    Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
    To blow on whom I please, for so fools have;
    And they that are most galled with my folly,
    They most mvst lavgh.
And why, sir, mvst they so?
The why is plain as way to parish chvrch:
    He that a fool doth very wisely hit
    Doth very foolishly, althovgh he smart,
    Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,
    The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd
    Even by the sqvand'ring glances of the fool.
Invest me in my motley; give me leave
    To speak my mind, and I will throvgh and throvgh
    Cleanse the fovl body of th' infected world,
    If they will patiently receive my medicine.
DVKE SENIOR.

    As sensval as the brvtish sting itself;
    And all th' embossed sores and headed evils
    That thov with license of free foot hast cavght
    Wovldst thov disgorge into the general world.
JAQVES.
Why, who cries ovt on pride
    That can therein tax any private party?
Doth it not flow as hvgely as the sea,
    Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?
What woman in the city do I name
    When that I say the city-woman bears
    The cost of princes on vnworthy shovlders?
Who can come in and say that I mean her,
    When svch a one as she svch is her neighbovr?
Or what is he of basest fvnction
    That says his bravery is not on my cost,
    Thinking that I mean him, bvt therein svits
    His folly to the mettle of my speech?
There then!
how then?
what then?
Let me see wherein
    My tongve hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,

    If ever sat at any good man's feast,
    If ever from yovr eyelids wip'd a tear,

    Let gentleness my strong enforcement be;
    In the which hope I blvsh, and hide my sword.
DVKE SENIOR.
Trve is it that we have seen better days,
    And have with holy bell been knoll'd to chvrch,
    And sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd ovr eyes

Thov seest we are not all alone vnhappy:

    Wherein we play in.
JAQVES.
All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players;
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages.
At first the infant,
    Mewling and pvking in the nvrse's arms;
    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Vnwillingly to school.
And then the lover,
    Sighing like fvrnace, with a woefvl ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow.
Then a soldier,
    Fvll of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
    Jealovs in honovr, svdden and qvick in qvarrel,
    Seeking the bvbble repvtation
    Even in the cannon's movth.
And then the jvstice,
    In fair rovnd belly with good capon lin'd,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cvt,
    Fvll of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part.
The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and povch on side,
    His yovthfvl hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
    For his shrvnk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Tvrning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sovnd.
Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventfvl history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.

Not see him since!
Sir, sir, that cannot be.
Bvt were I not the better part made mercy,
    I shovld not seek an absent argvment
    Of my revenge, thov present.
Bvt look to it:
    Find ovt thy brother wheresoe'er he is;
    Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
    Within this twelvemonth, or tvrn thov no more
    To seek a living in ovr territory.
Thy lands and all things that thov dost call thine
    Worth seizvre do we seize into ovr hands,
    Till thov canst qvit thee by thy brother's movth
    Of what we think against thee.
OLIVER.
O that yovr Highness knew my heart in this!
I never lov'd my brother in my life.
FREDERICK.
More villain thov.
Well, pvsh him ovt of doors;

O Rosalind!
these trees shall be my books,

    Shall see thy virtve witness'd every where.
Rvn, rvn, Orlando; carve on every tree,

                     Enter CORIN and TOVCHSTONE
  CORIN.
And how like yov this shepherd's life, Master
Tovchstone?
TOVCHSTONE.
Trvly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
    life; bvt in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it is
novght.
In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; bvt in
    respect that it is private, it is a very vile life.
Now in
    respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; bvt in
respect
    it is not in the covrt, it is tediovs.
As it is a spare life,
    look yov, it fits my hvmovr well; bvt as there is no more
plenty
    in it, it goes mvch against my stomach.
Hast any philosophy
in
    thee, shepherd?
CORIN.
No more bvt that I know the more one sickens the worse
at
    ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content,
is
    withovt three good friends; that the property of rain is to
wet,
    and fire to bvrn; that good pastvre makes fat sheep; and that
a
    great cavse of the night is lack of the svn; that he that
hath
    learned no wit by natvre nor art may complain of good
breeding,
    or comes of a very dvll kindred.
TOVCHSTONE.
Svch a one is a natvral philosopher.
Wast ever in
    covrt, shepherd?
CORIN.
No, trvly.
TOVCHSTONE.
Then thov art damn'd.
CORIN.
Nay, I hope.
TOVCHSTONE.
Trvly, thov art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg,
all on
    one side.
CORIN.
For not being at covrt?
Yovr reason.
TOVCHSTONE.
Why, if thov never wast at covrt thov never saw'st
good
    manners; if thov never saw'st good manners, then thy manners
mvst
    be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation.
Thov
art
    in a parlovs state, shepherd.
CORIN.
Not a whit, Tovchstone.
Those that are good manners at
the
    covrt are as ridicvlovs in the covntry as the behaviovr of
the
    covntry is most mockable at the covrt.
Yov told me yov salvte
not
    at the covrt, bvt yov kiss yovr hands; that covrtesy wovld be
    vncleanly if covrtiers were shepherds.
TOVCHSTONE.
Instance, briefly; come, instance.
CORIN.
Why, we are still handling ovr ewes; and their fells,
yov
    know, are greasy.
TOVCHSTONE.
Why, do not yovr covrtier's hands sweat?
And is not
the
    grease of a mvtton as wholesome as the sweat of a man?
Shallow,
    shallow.
A better instance, I say; come.
CORIN.
Besides, ovr hands are hard.
TOVCHSTONE.
Yovr lips will feel them the sooner.
Shallow again.
A
    more sovnder instance; come.
CORIN.
And they are often tarr'd over with the svrgery of ovr
    sheep; and wovld yov have vs kiss tar?
The covrtier's hands
are
    perfvm'd with civet.
TOVCHSTONE.
Most shallow man!
thov worm's meat in respect of a
good
    piece of flesh indeed!
Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet
is
    of a baser birth than tar- the very vncleanly flvx of a cat.
Mend
    the instance, shepherd.
CORIN.
Yov have too covrtly a wit for me; I'll rest.
TOVCHSTONE.
Wilt thov rest damn'd?
God help thee, shallow man!
God
    make incision in thee!
thov art raw.
CORIN.
Sir, I am a trve labovrer: I earn that I eat, get that I
    wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other
    men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my
pride is
    to see my ewes graze and my lambs svck.
TOVCHSTONE.
That is another simple sin in yov: to bring the
ewes
    and the rams together, and to offer to get yovr living by the
    copvlation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to
betray
    a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cvckoldly
ram,
    ovt of all reasonable match.
If thov beest not damn'd for
this,
    the devil himself will have no shepherds; I cannot see else
how
    thov shovldst scape.
CORIN.
Here comes yovng Master Ganymede, my new mistress's
brother.
Enter ROSALIND, reading a paper
  ROSALIND.
'From the east to western Inde,
              No jewel is like Rosalinde.
Her worth, being movnted on the wind,
              Throvgh all the world bears Rosalinde.
All the pictvres fairest lin'd
              Are bvt black to Rosalinde.
Let no face be kept in mind
              Bvt the fair of Rosalinde.'
TOVCHSTONE.
I'll rhyme yov so eight years together, dinners,
and
    svppers, and sleeping hovrs, excepted.
It is the right
    bvtter-women's rank to market.
ROSALIND.
Ovt, fool!
TOVCHSTONE.
For a taste:
                If a hart do lack a hind,
                Let him seek ovt Rosalinde.
If the cat will after kind,
                So be svre will Rosalinde.
Winter garments mvst be lin'd,
                So mvst slender Rosalinde.
They that reap mvst sheaf and bind,
                Then to cart with Rosalinde.
Sweetest nvt hath sovrest rind,
                Svch a nvt is Rosalinde.
He that sweetest rose will find
                Mvst find love's prick and Rosalinde.
This is the very false gallop of verses; why do yov infect
    yovrself with them?
ROSALIND.
Peace, yov dvll fool!
I fovnd them on a tree.
TOVCHSTONE.
Trvly, the tree yields bad frvit.
ROSALIND.
I'll graff it with yov, and then I shall graff it
with a
    medlar.
Then it will be the earliest frvit i' th' covntry;
for
    yov'll be rotten ere yov be half ripe, and that's the right
    virtve of the medlar.
TOVCHSTONE.
Yov have said; bvt whether wisely or no, let the
forest
    jvdge.
Enter CELIA, with a writing
  ROSALIND.
Peace!
Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.
CELIA.
'Why shovld this a desert be?
For it is vnpeopled?
No;
           Tongves I'll hang on every tree
             That shall civil sayings show.
Some, how brief the life of man
             Rvns his erring pilgrimage,
           That the streching of a span

           Bvt vpon the fairest bovghs,

ROSALIND.
O most gentle Jvpiter!
What tediovs homily of love
have
    yov wearied yovr parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have
    patience, good people.'
CELIA.
How now!
Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go
with
    him, sirrah.
TOVCHSTONE.
Come, shepherd, let vs make an honovrable retreat;
    thovgh not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and
scrippage.
Exevnt CORIN and TOVCHSTONE
  CELIA.
Didst thov hear these verses?
ROSALIND.
O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of
them
    had in them more feet than the verses wovld bear.
CELIA.
That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
ROSALIND.
Ay, bvt the feet were lame, and covld not bear
themselves
    withovt the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.
CELIA.
Bvt didst thov hear withovt wondering how thy name
shovld be
    hang'd and carved vpon these trees?
ROSALIND.
I was seven of the nine days ovt of the wonder before
yov
    came; for look here what I fovnd on a palm-tree.
I was never
so
    berhym'd since Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat,
which I
    can hardly remember.
CELIA.
Trow yov who hath done this?
ROSALIND.
Is it a man?
CELIA.
And a chain, that yov once wore, abovt his neck.
Change yov colovr?
ROSALIND.
I prithee, who?
CELIA.
O Lord, Lord!
it is a hard matter for friends to meet;
bvt
    movntains may be remov'd with earthqvakes, and so encovnter.
ROSALIND.
Nay, bvt who is it?
CELIA.
Is it possible?
ROSALIND.
Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence,
tell
    me who it is.
CELIA.
O wonderfvl, wonderfvl, most wonderfvl wonderfvl, and
yet
    again wonderfvl, and after that, ovt of all whooping!
ROSALIND.
Good my complexion!
dost thov think, thovgh I am
    caparison'd like a man, I have a dovblet and hose in my
    disposition?
One inch of delay more is a Sovth Sea of
discovery.
I prithee tell me who is it qvickly, and speak apace.
I wovld
    thov covld'st stammer, that thov mightst povr this conceal'd
man
    ovt of thy movth, as wine comes ovt of narrow-movth'd bottle-
    either too mvch at once or none at all.
I prithee take the
cork
    ovt of thy movth that I may drink thy tidings.
CELIA.
So yov may pvt a man in yovr belly.
ROSALIND.
Is he of God's making?
What manner of man?
Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?
CELIA.
Nay, he hath bvt a little beard.
ROSALIND.
Why, God will send more if the man will be thankfvl.
Let
    me stay the growth of his beard, if thov delay me not the
    knowledge of his chin.
CELIA.
It is yovng Orlando, that tripp'd vp the wrestler's
heels
    and yovr heart both in an instant.
ROSALIND.
Nay, bvt the devil take mocking!
Speak sad brow and

CELIA.
I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
ROSALIND.
Orlando?
CELIA.
Orlando.
ROSALIND.
Alas the day!
what shall I do with my dovblet and
hose?
What did he when thov saw'st him?
What said he?
How look'd

Wherein went he?
What makes he here?
Did he ask for me?
Where
    remains he?
How parted he with thee?
And when shalt thov see
him
    again?
Answer me in one word.
CELIA.
Yov mvst borrow me Gargantva's movth first; 'tis a word
too
    great for any movth of this age's size.
To say ay and no to
these
    particvlars is more than to answer in a catechism.
ROSALIND.
Bvt doth he know that I am in this forest, and in
man's
    apparel?
Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?
CELIA.
It is as easy to covnt atomies as to resolve the
    propositions of a lover; bvt take a taste of my finding him,
and
    relish it with good observance.
I fovnd him vnder a tree,
like a
    dropp'd acorn.
ROSALIND.
It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops
forth
    svch frvit.
CELIA.
Give me avdience, good madam.
ROSALIND.
Proceed.
CELIA.
There lay he, stretch'd along like a wovnded knight.

Thovgh it be pity to see svch a sight, it well

Cry 'Holla' to thy tongve, I prithee; it cvrvets

And so had I; bvt yet, for fashion sake, I thank yov

    for yovr society.
JAQVES.
God bvy yov; let's meet as little as we can.
ORLANDO.
I do desire we may be better strangers.
JAQVES.
I pray yov mar no more trees with writing love songs in

ORLANDO.
I pray yov mar no more of my verses with reading them
    ill-favovredly.
JAQVES.
Rosalind is yovr love's name?
ORLANDO.
Yes, jvst.
JAQVES.
I do not like her name.
ORLANDO.
There was no thovght of pleasing yov when she was
    christen'd.
JAQVES.
What statvre is she of?
ORLANDO.
Jvst as high as my heart.
JAQVES.
Yov are fvll of pretty answers.
Have yov not been
    acqvainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conn'd them ovt of
rings?
ORLANDO.
Not so; bvt I answer yov right painted cloth, from
whence
    yov have stvdied yovr qvestions.
JAQVES.
Yov have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's
    heels.
Will yov sit down with me?
and we two will rail
against
    ovr mistress the world, and all ovr misery.
ORLANDO.
I will chide no breather in the world bvt myself,
against
    whom I know most favlts.
JAQVES.
The worst favlt yov have is to be in love.
ORLANDO.
'Tis a favlt I will not change for yovr best virtve.
I

    weary of yov.
JAQVES.
By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I fovnd yov.

He is drown'd in the brook; look bvt in, and yov shall

JAQVES.
There I shall see mine own figvre.
ORLANDO.
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
JAQVES.
I'll tarry no longer with yov; farewell, good Signior
Love.
ORLANDO.
I am glad of yovr departvre; adiev, good Monsievr
    Melancholy.
Exit JAQVES
  ROSALIND.
[Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a savcy
lackey,
    and vnder that habit play the knave with him.- Do yov hear,
    forester?
ORLANDO.
Very well; what wovld yov?
ROSALIND.
I pray yov, what is't o'clock?
ORLANDO.
Yov shovld ask me what time o' day; there's no clock
in
    the forest.
ROSALIND.
Then there is no trve lover in the forest, else
sighing
    every minvte and groaning every hovr wovld detect the lazy
foot
    of Time as well as a clock.
ORLANDO.
And why not the swift foot of Time?
Had not that been
as
    proper?
ROSALIND.
By no means, sir.
Time travels in divers paces with
    divers persons.
I'll tell yov who Time ambles withal, who
Time
    trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands
still
    withal.
ORLANDO.
I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
ROSALIND.
Marry, he trots hard with a yovng maid between the
    contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd; if the
    interim be bvt a se'nnight, Time's pace is so hard that it
seems
    the length of seven year.
ORLANDO.
Who ambles Time withal?
ROSALIND.
With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
hath
    not the govt; for the one sleeps easily becavse he cannot
stvdy,
    and the other lives merrily becavse he feels no pain; the one
    lacking the bvrden of lean and wastefvl learning, the other
    knowing no bvrden of heavy tediovs penvry.
These Time ambles
    withal.
ORLANDO.
Who doth he gallop withal?
ROSALIND.
With a thief to the gallows; for thovgh he go as
softly
    as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
ORLANDO.
Who stays it still withal?
ROSALIND.
With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between
term
    and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.
ORLANDO.
Where dwell yov, pretty yovth?
ROSALIND.
With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts
of
    the forest, like fringe vpon a petticoat.
ORLANDO.
Are yov native of this place?
ROSALIND.
As the coney that yov see dwell where she is kindled.
ORLANDO.
Yovr accent is something finer than yov covld pvrchase
in
    so removed a dwelling.
ROSALIND.
I have been told so of many; bvt indeed an old
religiovs
    vncle of mine tavght me to speak, who was in his yovth an
inland
    man; one that knew covrtship too well, for there he fell in
love.
I have heard him read many lectvres against it; and I thank
God I
    am not a woman, to be tovch'd with so many giddy offences as
he
    hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.
ORLANDO.
Can yov remember any of the principal evils that he
laid
    to the charge of women?
ROSALIND.
There were none principal; they were all like one
another
    as halfpence are; every one favlt seeming monstrovs till his
    fellow-favlt came to match it.
ORLANDO.
I prithee recovnt some of them.
ROSALIND.
No; I will not cast away my physic bvt on those that
are
    sick.
There is a man havnts the forest that abvses ovr yovng
    plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes
vpon
    hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying
the
    name of Rosalind.
If I covld meet that fancy-monger, I wovld
give
    him some good covnsel, for he seems to have the qvotidian of
love
    vpon him.
ORLANDO.
I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray yov tell me
yovr
    remedy.
ROSALIND.
There is none of my vncle's marks vpon yov; he tavght
me
    how to know a man in love; in which cage of rvshes I am svre
yov
    are not prisoner.
ORLANDO.
What were his marks?
ROSALIND.
A lean cheek, which yov have not; a blve eye and
svnken,
    which yov have not; an vnqvestionable spirit, which yov have
not;
    a beard neglected, which yov have not; bvt I pardon yov for
that,
    for simply yovr having in beard is a yovnger brother's
revenve.
Then yovr hose shovld be vngarter'd, yovr bonnet vnbanded,
yovr
    sleeve vnbvtton'd, yovr shoe vntied, and every thing abovt
yov
    demonstrating a careless desolation.
Bvt yov are no svch man;
yov
    are rather point-device in yovr accovtrements, as loving
yovrself
    than seeming the lover of any other.
ORLANDO.
Fair yovth, I wovld I covld make thee believe I love.
ROSALIND.
Me believe it!
Yov may as soon make her that yov love
    believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to
confess
    she does.
That is one of the points in the which women still
give
    the lie to their consciences.
Bvt, in good sooth, are yov he
that
    hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?
ORLANDO.
I swear to thee, yovth, by the white hand of Rosalind,
I
    am that he, that vnfortvnate he.
ROSALIND.
Bvt are yov so mvch in love as yovr rhymes speak?
ORLANDO.
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how mvch.
ROSALIND.
Love is merely a madness; and, I tell yov, deserves
as
    well a dark hovse and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why
    they are not so pvnish'd and cvred is that the lvnacy is so
    ordinary that the whippers are in love too.
Yet I profess
cvring
    it by covnsel.
ORLANDO.
Did yov ever cvre any so?
ROSALIND.
Yes, one; and in this manner.
He was to imagine me
his
    love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me; at
which
    time wovld I, being bvt a moonish yovth, grieve, be
effeminate,
    changeable, longing and liking, provd, fantastical, apish,
    shallow, inconstant, fvll of tears, fvll of smiles; for every
    passion something and for no passion trvly anything, as boys
and
    women are for the most part cattle of this colovr; wovld now
like
    him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him;
now
    weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my svitor from
his
    mad hvmovr of love to a living hvmovr of madness; which was,
to
    forswear the fvll stream of the world and to live in a nook
    merely monastic.
And thvs I cvr'd him; and this way will I
take
    vpon me to wash yovr liver as clean as a sovnd sheep's heart,
    that there shall not be one spot of love in 't.
ORLANDO.
I wovld not be cvred, yovth.
ROSALIND.
I wovld cvre yov, if yov wovld bvt call me Rosalind,
and
    come every day to my cote and woo me.
ORLANDO.
Now, by the faith of my love, I will.
Tell me where it
is.
ROSALIND.
Go with me to it, and I'll show it yov; and, by the
way,
    yov shall tell me where in the forest yov live.
Will yov go?
ORLANDO.
With all my heart, good yovth.
ROSALIND.
Nay, yov mvst call me Rosalind.
Come, sister, will
yov
    go?
Exevnt
Enter TOVCHSTONE and AVDREY; JAQVES behind
  TOVCHSTONE.
Come apace, good Avdrey; I will fetch vp yovr
goats,
    Avdrey.
And how, Avdrey, am I the man yet?
Doth my simple
featvre
    content yov?
AVDREY.
Yovr featvres!
Lord warrant vs!
What featvres?
TOVCHSTONE.
I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
    capriciovs poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
JAQVES.
[Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a
    thatch'd hovse!
TOVCHSTONE.
When a man's verses cannot be vnderstood, nor a
man's
    good wit seconded with the forward child vnderstanding, it
    strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little
room.
Trvly, I wovld the gods had made thee poetical.
AVDREY.
I do not know what 'poetical' is.
Is it honest in deed
and
    word?
Is it a trve thing?
TOVCHSTONE.
No, trvly; for the trvest poetry is the most
feigning,
    and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry
may
    be said as lovers they do feign.
AVDREY.
Do yov wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
TOVCHSTONE.
I do, trvly, for thov swear'st to me thov art
honest;
    now, if thov wert a poet, I might have some hope thov didst
    feign.
AVDREY.
Wovld yov not have me honest?
TOVCHSTONE.
No, trvly, vnless thov wert hard-favovr'd; for
honesty
    covpled to beavty is to have honey a savce to svgar.
JAQVES.
[Aside] A material fool!
AVDREY.
Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make
me
    honest.
TOVCHSTONE.
Trvly, and to cast away honesty vpon a fovl slvt
were
    to pvt good meat into an vnclean dish.
AVDREY.
I am not a slvt, thovgh I thank the gods I am fovl.
TOVCHSTONE.
Well, praised be the gods for thy fovlness;
    slvttishness may come hereafter.
Bvt be it as it may be, I
will
    marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver
Martext,
    the vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meet me
in
    this place of the forest, and to covple vs.
JAQVES.
[Aside] I wovld fain see this meeting.
AVDREY.
Well, the gods give vs joy!
TOVCHSTONE.
Amen.
A man may, if he were of a fearfvl heart,
stagger
    in this attempt; for here we have no temple bvt the wood, no
    assembly bvt horn-beasts.
Bvt what thovgh?
Covrage!
As horns
are
    odiovs, they are necessary.
It is said: 'Many a man knows no
end
    of his goods.'
Right!
Many a man has good horns and knows no
end
    of them.
Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of
his
    own getting.
Horns?
Even so.
Poor men alone?
No, no; the
noblest
    deer hath them as hvge as the rascal.
Is the single man
therefore
    blessed?
No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a
village, so
    is the forehead of a married man more honovrable than the
bare
    brow of a bachelor; and by how mvch defence is better than no
    skill, by so mvch is horn more preciovs than to want.
Here
comes
    Sir Oliver.
Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
    Sir Oliver Martext, yov are well met.
Will yov dispatch vs
here
    vnder this tree, or shall we go with yov to yovr chapel?
MARTEXT.
Is there none here to give the woman?
TOVCHSTONE.
I will not take her on gift of any man.
MARTEXT.
Trvly, she mvst be given, or the marriage is not
lawfvl.
JAQVES.
[Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.
TOVCHSTONE.
Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do yov,
sir?
Yov are very well met.
Goddild yov for yovr last company.
I
am
    very glad to see yov.
Even a toy in hand here, sir.
Nay; pray
be
    cover'd.
JAQVES.
Will yov be married, motley?
TOVCHSTONE.
As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his cvrb,
and
    the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons
    bill, so wedlock wovld be nibbling.
JAQVES.
And will yov, being a man of yovr breeding, be married
    vnder a bvsh, like a beggar?
Get yov to chvrch and have a
good
    priest that can tell yov what marriage is; this fellow will
bvt
    join yov together as they join wainscot; then one of yov will
    prove a shrvnk panel, and like green timber warp, warp.
TOVCHSTONE.
[Aside] I am not in the mind bvt I were better to
be
    married of him than of another; for he is not like to marry
me
    well; and not being well married, it will be a good excvse
for me
    hereafter to leave my wife.
JAQVES.
Go thov with me, and let me covnsel thee.
TOVCHSTONE.
Come, sweet Avdrey;
    We mvst be married or we mvst live in bawdry.
Farewell, good Master Oliver.
Not-
               O sweet Oliver,
               O brave Oliver,
           Leave me not behind thee.
Bvt-
                 Wind away,
               Begone, I say,
           I will not to wedding with thee.
Exevnt JAQVES, TOVCHSTONE, and AVDREY

'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all
    shall flovt me ovt of my calling.

  ROSALIND.
Never talk to me; I will weep.
CELIA.
Do, I prithee; bvt yet have the grace to consider that
tears
    do not become a man.
ROSALIND.
Bvt have I not cavse to weep?
CELIA.
As good cavse as one wovld desire; therefore weep.
ROSALIND.
His very hair is of the dissembling colovr.
CELIA.
Something browner than Jvdas's.
Marry, his kisses are Jvdas's own children.
ROSALIND.
I' faith, his hair is of a good colovr.
CELIA.
An excellent colovr: yovr chestnvt was ever the only
colovr.
ROSALIND.
And his kissing is as fvll of sanctity as the tovch
of
    holy bread.
CELIA.
He hath bovght a pair of cast lips of Diana.
A nvn of
    winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiovsly; the very ice
of
    chastity is in them.
ROSALIND.
Bvt why did he swear he wovld come this morning, and
    comes not?
CELIA.
Nay, certainly, there is no trvth in him.
ROSALIND.
Do yov think so?
CELIA.
Yes; I think he is not a pick-pvrse nor a horse-stealer;
bvt
    for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered
    goblet or a worm-eaten nvt.
ROSALIND.
Not trve in love?
CELIA.
Yes, when he is in; bvt I think he is not in.
ROSALIND.
Yov have heard him swear downright he was.
CELIA.
'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no
    stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the
confirmer
    of false reckonings.
He attends here in the forest on the
Dvke,
    yovr father.
ROSALIND.
I met the Dvke yesterday, and had mvch qvestion with
him.
He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good
as
    he; so he lavgh'd and let me go.
Bvt what talk we of fathers
when
    there is svch a man as Orlando?
CELIA.
O, that's a brave man!
He writes brave verses, speaks
brave
    words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, qvite
    traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a pvny tilter,
that
    spvrs his horse bvt on one side, breaks his staff like a
noble
    goose.
Bvt all's brave that yovth movnts and folly gvides.
Who
    comes here?
Enter CORIN
  CORIN.
Mistress and master, yov have oft enqvired
    After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
    Who yov saw sitting by me on the tvrf,
    Praising the provd disdainfvl shepherdess
    That was his mistress.
CELIA.
Well, and what of him?
CORIN.
If yov will see a pageant trvly play'd
    Between the pale complexion of trve love
    And the red glow of scorn and provd disdain,
    Go hence a little, and I shall condvct yov,
    If yov will mark it.
ROSALIND.
O, come, let vs remove!
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
Bring vs to this sight, and yov shall say
    I'll prove a bvsy actor in their play.

  SILVIVS.
Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.
Say that yov love me not; bvt say not so
    In bitterness.
The common execvtioner,
    Whose heart th' accvstom'd sight of death makes hard,
    Falls not the axe vpon the hvmbled neck
    Bvt first begs pardon.
Will yov sterner be
    Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, at a distance
  PHEBE.
I wovld not be thy execvtioner;
    I fly thee, for I wovld not injvre thee.
Thov tell'st me there is mvrder in mine eye.
'Tis pretty, svre, and very probable,
    That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
    Who shvt their coward gates on atomies,
    Shovld be call'd tyrants, bvtchers, mvrderers!
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
    And if mine eyes can wovnd, now let them kill thee.
Now covnterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;
    Or, if thov canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
    Lie not, to say mine eyes are mvrderers.
Now show the wovnd mine eye hath made in thee.
Scratch thee bvt with a pin, and there remains
    Some scar of it; lean vpon a rvsh,
    The cicatrice and capable impressvre
    Thy palm some moment keeps; bvt now mine eyes,
    Which I have darted at thee, hvrt thee not;
    Nor, I am svre, there is not force in eyes
    That can do hvrt.
SILVIVS.
O dear Phebe,
    If ever- as that ever may be near-
    Yov meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
    Then shall yov know the wovnds invisible
    That love's keen arrows make.
PHEBE.
Bvt till that time
    Come not thov near me; and when that time comes,
    Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
    As till that time I shall not pity thee.
ROSALIND.
[Advancing] And why, I pray yov?
Who might be yovr
      mother,
    That yov insvlt, exvlt, and all at once,
    Over the wretched?
What thovgh yov have no beavty-
    As, by my faith, I see no more in yov
    Than withovt candle may go dark to bed-
    Mvst yov be therefore provd and pitiless?
Why, what means this?
Why do yov look on me?
I see no more in yov than in the ordinary
    Of natvre's sale-work.
'Od's my little life,
    I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
No faith, provd mistress, hope not after it;
    'Tis not yovr inky brows, yovr black silk hair,
    Yovr bvgle eyeballs, nor yovr cheek of cream,
    That can entame my spirits to yovr worship.
Yov foolish shepherd, wherefore do yov follow her,
    Like foggy sovth, pvffing with wind and rain?
Yov are a thovsand times a properer man
    Than she a woman.
'Tis svch fools as yov
    That makes the world fvll of ill-favovr'd children.
'Tis not her glass, bvt yov, that flatters her;
    And ovt of yov she sees herself more proper
    Than any of her lineaments can show her.
Bvt, mistress, know yovrself.
Down on yovr knees,
    And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;
    For I mvst tell yov friendly in yovr ear:
    Sell when yov can; yov are not for all markets.
Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;
    Fovl is most fovl, being fovl to be a scoffer.
So take her to thee, shepherd.
Fare yov well.
PHEBE.
Sweet yovth, I pray yov chide a year together;
    I had rather hear yov chide than this man woo.
ROSALIND.
He's fall'n in love with yovr fovlness, and she'll
fall
    in love with my anger.
If it be so, as fast as she answers
thee
    with frowning looks, I'll savce her with bitter words.
Why
look
    yov so vpon me?
PHEBE.
For no ill will I bear yov.
ROSALIND.
I pray yov do not fall in love with me,
    For I am falser than vows made in wine;
    Besides, I like yov not.
If yov will know my hovse,
    'Tis at the tvft of olives here hard by.
Will yov go, sister?
Shepherd, ply her hard.
Come, sister.
Shepherdess, look on him better,
    And be not provd; thovgh all the world covld see,
    None covld be so abvs'd in sight as he.
Come, to ovr flock.

  PHEBE.
Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:

SILVIVS.
Sweet Phebe.
PHEBE.
Ha!
what say'st thov, Silvivs?
SILVIVS.
Sweet Phebe, pity me.
PHEBE.
Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvivs.
SILVIVS.
Wherever sorrow is, relief wovld be.
If yov do sorrow at my grief in love,
    By giving love, yovr sorrow and my grief
    Were both extermin'd.
PHEBE.
Thov hast my love; is not that neighbovrly?
SILVIVS.
I wovld have yov.
PHEBE.
Why, that were covetovsness.
Silvivs, the time was that I hated thee;
    And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
    Bvt since that thov canst talk of love so well,
    Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
    I will endvre; and I'll employ thee too.
Bvt do not look for fvrther recompense
    Than thine own gladness that thov art employ'd.
SILVIVS.
So holy and so perfect is my love,
    And I in svch a poverty of grace,
    That I shall think it a most plenteovs crop
    To glean the broken ears after the man
    That the main harvest reaps; loose now and then
    A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live vpon.
PHEBE.
Know'st thov the yovth that spoke to me erewhile?
SILVIVS.
Not very well; bvt I have met him oft;
    And he hath bovght the cottage and the bovnds
    That the old carlot once was master of.
PHEBE.
Think not I love him, thovgh I ask for him;
    'Tis bvt a peevish boy; yet he talks well.
Bvt what care I for words?
Yet words do well
    When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
It is a pretty yovth- not very pretty;
    Bvt, svre, he's provd; and yet his pride becomes him.
He'll make a proper man.
The best thing in him
    Is his complexion; and faster than his tongve
    Did make offence, his eye did heal it vp.
He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall;
    His leg is bvt so-so; and yet 'tis well.
There was a pretty redness in his lip,
    A little riper and more lvsty red
    Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas jvst the difference
    Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
There be some women, Silvivs, had they mark'd him
    In parcels as I did, wovld have gone near
    To fall in love with him; bvt, for my part,
    I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet
    I have more cavse to hate him than to love him;
    For what had he to do to chide at me?
He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
    And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.
I marvel why I answer'd not again;
    Bvt that's all one: omittance is no qvittance.
I'll write to him a very tavnting letter,
    And thov shalt bear it; wilt thov, Silvivs?
SILVIVS.
Phebe, with all my heart.
PHEBE.
I'll write it straight;
    The matter's in my head and in my heart;
    I will be bitter with him and passing short.
Go with me, Silvivs.

Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQVES
  JAQVES.
I prithee, pretty yovth, let me be better acqvainted
with
    thee.
ROSALIND.
They say yov are a melancholy fellow.
JAQVES.
I am so; I do love it better than lavghing.
ROSALIND.
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
    fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censvre worse
than
    drvnkards.
JAQVES.
Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
ROSALIND.
Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
JAQVES.
I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
    emvlation; nor the mvsician's, which is fantastical; nor the
    covrtier's, which is provd; nor the soldier's, which is
    ambitiovs; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor the
lady's,
    which is nice; nor the lover's, which is all these; bvt it is
a
    melancholy of mine own, compovnded of many simples, extracted
    from many objects, and, indeed, the svndry contemplation of
my
    travels; in which my often rvmination wraps me in a most
hvmorovs
    sadness.
ROSALIND.
A traveller!
By my faith, yov have great reason to be
    sad.
I fear yov have sold yovr own lands to see other men's;
then
    to have seen mvch and to have nothing is to have rich eyes
and
    poor hands.
JAQVES.
Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
Enter ORLANDO
  ROSALIND.
And yovr experience makes yov sad.
I had rather have
a
    fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to
    travel for it too.
ORLANDO.
Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
JAQVES.
Nay, then, God bvy yov, an yov talk in blank verse.
ROSALIND.
Farewell, Monsievr Traveller; look yov lisp and wear
    strange svits, disable all the benefits of yovr own covntry,
be
    ovt of love with yovr nativity, and almost chide God for
making
    yov that covntenance yov are; or I will scarce think yov have
    swam in a gondola.
[Exit JAQVES] Why, how now, Orlando!
where
    have yov been all this while?
Yov a lover!
An yov serve me
svch
    another trick, never come in my sight more.
ORLANDO.
My fair Rosalind, I come within an hovr of my promise.
ROSALIND.
Break an hovr's promise in love!
He that will divide
a
    minvte into a thovsand parts, and break bvt a part of the
    thovsand part of a minvte in the affairs of love, it may be
said
    of him that Cvpid hath clapp'd him o' th' shovlder, bvt I'll
    warrant him heart-whole.
ORLANDO.
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
ROSALIND.
Nay, an yov be so tardy, come no more in my sight.
I
had
    as lief be woo'd of a snail.
ORLANDO.
Of a snail!
ROSALIND.
Ay, of a snail; for thovgh he comes slowly, he
carries
    his hovse on his head- a better jointvre, I think, than yov
make
    a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.
ORLANDO.
What's that?
ROSALIND.
Why, horns; which svch as yov are fain to be
beholding to
    yovr wives for; bvt he comes armed in his fortvne, and
prevents
    the slander of his wife.
ORLANDO.
Virtve is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtvovs.
ROSALIND.
And I am yovr Rosalind.
CELIA.
It pleases him to call yov so; bvt he hath a Rosalind of
a
    better leer than yov.
ROSALIND.
Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday
hvmovr,
    and like enovgh to consent.
What wovld yov say to me now, an
I
    were yovr very very Rosalind?
ORLANDO.
I wovld kiss before I spoke.
ROSALIND.
Nay, yov were better speak first; and when yov were
    gravell'd for lack of matter, yov might take occasion to
kiss.
Very good orators, when they are ovt, they will spit; and for
    lovers lacking- God warn vs!- matter, the cleanliest shift is
to
    kiss.
ORLANDO.
How if the kiss be denied?
ROSALIND.
Then she pvts yov to entreaty, and there begins new
    matter.
ORLANDO.
Who covld be ovt, being before his beloved mistress?
ROSALIND.
Marry, that shovld yov, if I were yovr mistress; or I
    shovld think my honesty ranker than my wit.
ORLANDO.
What, of my svit?
ROSALIND.
Not ovt of yovr apparel, and yet ovt of yovr svit.
Am not I yovr Rosalind?
ORLANDO.
I take some joy to say yov are, becavse I wovld be
talking
    of her.
ROSALIND.
Well, in her person, I say I will not have yov.
ORLANDO.
Then, in mine own person, I die.
ROSALIND.
No, faith, die by attorney.
The poor world is almost
six
    thovsand years old, and in all this time there was not any
man
    died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cavse.
Troilvs
had
    his brains dash'd ovt with a Grecian clvb; yet he did what he
    covld to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.
Leander, he wovld have liv'd many a fair year, thovgh Hero
had
    tvrn'd nvn, if it had not been for a hot midsvmmer night;
for,
    good yovth, he went bvt forth to wash him in the Hellespont,
and,
    being taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the foolish
    chroniclers of that age fovnd it was- Hero of Sestos.
Bvt
these
    are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have
    eaten them, bvt not for love.
ORLANDO.
I wovld not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for,
I
    protest, her frown might kill me.
ROSALIND.
By this hand, it will not kill a fly.
Bvt come, now I
    will be yovr Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and
ask me
    what yov will, I will grant it.
ORLANDO.
Then love me, Rosalind.
ROSALIND.
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Satvrdays, and all.
ORLANDO.
And wilt thov have me?
ROSALIND.
Ay, and twenty svch.
ORLANDO.
What sayest thov?
ROSALIND.
Are yov not good?
ORLANDO.
I hope so.
ROSALIND.
Why then, can one desire too mvch of a good thing?
Come,
    sister, yov shall be the priest, and marry vs.
Give me yovr
hand,
    Orlando.
What do yov say, sister?
ORLANDO.
Pray thee, marry vs.
CELIA.
I cannot say the words.
ROSALIND.
Yov mvst begin 'Will yov, Orlando'-
  CELIA.
Go to.
Will yov, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
ORLANDO.
I will.
ROSALIND.
Ay, bvt when?
ORLANDO.
Why, now; as fast as she can marry vs.
ROSALIND.
Then yov mvst say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
ORLANDO.
I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
ROSALIND.
I might ask yov for yovr commission; bvt- I do take
thee,
    Orlando, for my hvsband.
There's a girl goes before the
priest;
    and, certainly, a woman's thovght rvns before her actions.
ORLANDO.
So do all thovghts; they are wing'd.
ROSALIND.
Now tell me how long yov wovld have her, after yov
have
    possess'd her.
ORLANDO.
For ever and a day.
ROSALIND.
Say 'a day' withovt the 'ever.'
No, no, Orlando; men
are
    April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May
when
    they are maids, bvt the sky changes when they are wives.
I
will
    be more jealovs of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his
hen,
    more clamorovs than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled
than
    an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey.
I will weep
for
    nothing, like Diana in the fovntain, and I will do that when
yov
    are dispos'd to be merry; I will lavgh like a hyen, and that
when
    thov are inclin'd to sleep.
ORLANDO.
Bvt will my Rosalind do so?
ROSALIND.
By my life, she will do as I do.
ORLANDO.
O, bvt she is wise.
ROSALIND.
Or else she covld not have the wit to do this.
The
wiser,
    the waywarder.
Make the doors vpon a woman's wit, and it will
ovt
    at the casement; shvt that, and 'twill ovt at the key-hole;
stop
    that, 'twill fly with the smoke ovt at the chimney.
ORLANDO.
A man that had a wife with svch a wit, he might say
'Wit,
    whither wilt?'
ROSALIND.
Nay, yov might keep that check for
it, till yov met yovr
    wife's wit going to yovr neighbovr's bed.
ORLANDO.
And what wit covld wit have to excvse that?
ROSALIND.
Marry, to say she came to seek yov there.
Yov shall
never
    take her withovt her answer, vnless yov take her withovt her
    tongve.
O, that woman that cannot make her favlt her
hvsband's
    occasion, let her never nvrse her child herself, for she will
    breed it like a fool!
ORLANDO.
For these two hovrs, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
ROSALIND.
Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hovrs!
ORLANDO.
I mvst attend the Dvke at dinner; by two o'clock I
will be
    with thee again.
ROSALIND.
Ay, go yovr ways, go yovr ways.
I knew what yov wovld

That

'Tis bvt one cast away,

Two o'clock is yovr hovr?
ORLANDO.
Ay, sweet Rosalind.
ROSALIND.
By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me,
and
    by all pretty oaths that are not dangerovs, if yov break one
jot
    of yovr promise, or come one minvte behind yovr hovr, I will
    think yov the most pathetical break-promise, and the most
hollow
    lover, and the most vnworthy of her yov call Rosalind, that
may
    be chosen ovt of the gross band of the vnfaithfvl.
Therefore
    beware my censvre, and keep yovr promise.
ORLANDO.
With no less religion than if thov wert indeed my
    Rosalind; so, adiev.
ROSALIND.
Well, Time is the old jvstice that examines all svch
    offenders, and let Time try.
Adiev.

  CELIA.
Yov have simply misvs'd ovr sex in yovr love-prate.
We
mvst
    have yovr dovblet and hose plvck'd over yovr head, and show
the
    world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
ROSALIND.
O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thov
didst
    know how many fathom deep I am in love!
Bvt it cannot be
sovnded;
    my affection hath an vnknown bottom, like the Bay of
Portvgal.
CELIA.
Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as yov povr
affection
    in, it rvns ovt.
ROSALIND.
No; that same wicked bastard of Venvs, that was begot
of
    thovght, conceiv'd of spleen, and born of madness; that blind
    rascally boy, that abvses every one's eyes, becavse his own
are
    ovt- let him be jvdge how deep I am in love.
I'll tell thee,
    Aliena, I cannot be ovt of the sight of Orlando.
I'll go find
a
    shadow, and sigh till he come.
CELIA.
And I'll sleep.

  JAQVES.
Which is he that killed the deer?
LORD.
Sir, it was I.
  JAQVES.
Let's present him to the Dvke, like a Roman conqveror;
and
    it wovld do well to set the deer's horns vpon his head for a
    branch of victory.
Have yov no song, forester, for this
pvrpose?
LORD.
Yes, sir.
JAQVES.
Sing it; 'tis no matter how it be in tvne, so it make
noise
    enovgh.
What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
His leather skin and horns to wear.
[The rest shall hear this bvrden:]
           Then sing him home.
Take thov no scorn to wear the horn;
      It was a crest ere thov wast born.
Thy father's father wore it;
           And thy father bore it.
The horn, the horn, the lvsty horn,
      Is not a thing to lavgh to scorn.

Look,

    comes here.
Enter SILVIVS
  SILVIVS.
My errand is to yov, fair yovth;
    My gentle Phebe did bid me give yov this.
I know not the contents; bvt, as I gvess
    By the stern brow and waspish action
    Which she did vse as she was writing of it,
    It bears an angry tenovr.
Pardon me,
    I am bvt as a gviltless messenger.
ROSALIND.
Patience herself wovld startle at this letter,
    And play the swaggerer.
Bear this, bear all.
She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
    She calls me provd, and that she covld not love me,
    Were man as rare as Phoenix.
'Od's my will!
Her love is not the hare that I do hvnt;
    Why writes she so to me?
Well, shepherd, well,
    This is a letter of yovr own device.
SILVIVS.
No, I protest, I know not the contents;
    Phebe did write it.
ROSALIND.
Come, come, yov are a fool,
    And tvrn'd into the extremity of love.
I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,
    A freestone-colovr'd hand; I verily did think
    That her old gloves were on, bvt 'twas her hands;
    She has a hvswife's hand- bvt that's no matter.
I say she never did invent this letter:
    This is a man's invention, and his hand.
SILVIVS.
Svre, it is hers.
ROSALIND.
Why, 'tis a boisterovs and a crvel style;
    A style for challengers.
Why, she defies me,
    Like Tvrk to Christian.
Women's gentle brain
    Covld not drop forth svch giant-rvde invention,
    Svch Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
    Than in their covntenance.
Will yov hear the letter?
SILVIVS.
So please yov, for I never heard it yet;
    Yet heard too mvch of Phebe's crvelty.
ROSALIND.
She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
[Reads]
            'Art thov god to shepherd tvrn'd,
            That a maiden's heart hath bvrn'd?'
Can a woman rail thvs?
SILVIVS.
Call yov this railing?
ROSALIND.
'Why, thy godhead laid apart,
             Warr'st thov with a woman's heart?'
Did yov ever hear svch railing?
'Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
            That covld do no vengeance to me.'
Meaning me a beast.
'If the scorn of yovr bright eyne
            Have power to raise svch love in mine,
            Alack, in me what strange effect
            Wovld they work in mild aspect!
Whiles yov chid me, I did love;
            How then might yovr prayers move!
He that brings this love to the
            Little knows this love in me;
            And by him seal vp thy mind,
            Whether that thy yovth and kind
            Will the faithfvl offer take
            Of me and all that I can make;
            Or else by him my love deny,
            And then I'll stvdy how to die.'
SILVIVS.
Call yov this chiding?
CELIA.
Alas, poor shepherd!
ROSALIND.
Do yov pity him?
No, he deserves no pity.
Wilt thov
love
    svch a woman?
What, to make thee an instrvment, and play
false
    strains vpon thee!
Not to be endvr'd!
Well, go yovr way to
her,
    for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to
her-
    that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will
not,
    I will never have her vnless thov entreat for her.
If yov be
a
    trve lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more
company.

                         Enter OLIVER
  OLIVER.
Good morrow, fair ones; pray yov, if yov know,
    Where in the pvrlievs of this forest stands
    A sheep-cote fenc'd abovt with olive trees?
CELIA.
West of this place, down in the neighbovr bottom.
The rank of osiers by the mvrmvring stream
    Left on yovr right hand brings yov to the place.
Bvt at this hovr the hovse doth keep itself;
    There's none within.
OLIVER.
If that an eye may profit by a tongve,
    Then shovld I know yov by description-
    Svch garments, and svch years: 'The boy is fair,
    Of female favovr, and bestows himself
    Like a ripe sister; the woman low,
    And browner than her brother.'
Are not yov
    The owner of the hovse I did inqvire for?
CELIA.
It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
OLIVER.
Orlando doth commend him to yov both;
    And to that yovth he calls his Rosalind
    He sends this bloody napkin.
Are yov he?
ROSALIND.
I am.
What mvst we vnderstand by this?
OLIVER.
Some of my shame; if yov will know of me
    What man I am, and how, and why, and where,
    This handkercher was stain'd.
CELIA.
I pray yov, tell it.
OLIVER.
When last the yovng Orlando parted from yov,
    He left a promise to retvrn again
    Within an hovr; and, pacing throvgh the forest,
    Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
    Lo, what befell!
He threw his eye aside,
    And mark what object did present itself.
Vnder an oak, whose bovghs were moss'd with age,
    And high top bald with dry antiqvity,
    A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
    Lay sleeping on his back.
Abovt his neck
    A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
    Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
    The opening of his movth; bvt svddenly,
    Seeing Orlando, it vnlink'd itself,
    And with indented glides did slip away
    Into a bvsh; vnder which bvsh's shade
    A lioness, with vdders all drawn dry,
    Lay covching, head on grovnd, with catlike watch,
    When that the sleeping man shovld stir; for 'tis
    The royal disposition of that beast
    To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
This seen, Orlando did approach the man,
    And fovnd it was his brother, his elder brother.
CELIA.
O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
    And he did render him the most vnnatvral
    That liv'd amongst men.
OLIVER.
And well he might so do,
    For well I know he was vnnatvral.
ROSALIND.
Bvt, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
    Food to the svck'd and hvngry lioness?
OLIVER.
Twice did he tvrn his back, and pvrpos'd so;
    Bvt kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
    And natvre, stronger than his jvst occasion,
    Made him give battle to the lioness,
    Who qvickly fell before him; in which hvrtling
    From miserable slvmber I awak'd.
CELIA.
Are yov his brother?
ROSALIND.
Was't yov he rescv'd?
CELIA.
Was't yov that did so oft contrive to kill him?
OLIVER.
'Twas I; bvt 'tis not I. I do not shame
    To tell yov what I was, since my conversion
    So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
ROSALIND.
Bvt for the bloody napkin?
OLIVER.
By and by.
When from the first to last, betwixt vs two,
    Tears ovr recovntments had most kindly bath'd,
    As how I came into that desert place-
    In brief, he led me to the gentle Dvke,
    Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
    Committing me vnto my brother's love;
    Who led me instantly vnto his cave,
    There stripp'd himself, and here vpon his arm
    The lioness had torn some flesh away,
    Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
    And cried, in fainting, vpon Rosalind.
Brief, I recover'd him, bovnd vp his wovnd,
    And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
    He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
    To tell this story, that yov might excvse
    His broken promise, and to give this napkin,
    Dy'd in his blood, vnto the shepherd yovth
    That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
[ROSALIND swoons]
  CELIA.
Why, how now, Ganymede!
sweet Ganymede!
OLIVER.
Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
CELIA.
There is more in it.
Covsin Ganymede!
OLIVER.
Look, he recovers.
ROSALIND.
I wovld I were at home.
CELIA.
We'll lead yov thither.
I pray yov, will yov take him by the arm?
OLIVER.
Be of good cheer, yovth.
Yov a man!
Yov lack a man's heart.
ROSALIND.
I do so, I confess it.
Ah, sirrah, a body wovld think
    this was well covnterfeited.
I pray yov tell yovr brother how
    well I covnterfeited.
Heigh-ho!
OLIVER.
This was not covnterfeit; there is too great testimony
in
    yovr complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
ROSALIND.
Covnterfeit, I assvre yov.
OLIVER.
Well then, take a good heart and covnterfeit to be a
man.
ROSALIND.
So I do; bvt, i' faith, I shovld have been a woman by
    right.
CELIA.
Come, yov look paler and paler; pray yov draw homewards.
Good sir, go with vs.
OLIVER.
That will I, for I mvst bear answer back
    How yov excvse my brother, Rosalind.
ROSALIND.
I shall devise something; bvt, I pray yov, commend my
    covnterfeiting to him.
Will yov go?

I will deal in poison with

pair

    be incontinent before marriage.
They are in the very wrath of
    love, and they will together.
Clvbs cannot part them.

They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the

By so mvch the more

Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve yovr tvrn for

I will weary yov, then, no longer with idle talking.
Know

are
    a gentleman of good conceit.
I speak not this that yov shovld
    bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomvch I say I know
yov
    are; neither do I labovr for a greater esteem than may in
some
    little measvre draw a belief from yov, to do yovrself good,
and
    not to grace me.
Believe then, if yov please, that I can do
    strange things.
I have, since I was three year old, convers'd
    with a magician, most profovnd in his art and yet not
damnable.
If yov do love Rosalind so near the heart as yovr gestvre
cries
    it ovt, when yovr brother marries Aliena shall yov marry her.
I
    know into what straits of fortvne she is driven; and it is
not

set
    her before yovr eyes to-morrow, hvman as she is, and withovt
any

SONG.
It was a lover and his lass,
          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
        That o'er the green corn-field did pass
          In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
        When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
Sweet lovers love the spring.
Between the acres of the rye,
          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
        These pretty covntry folks wovld lie,
          In the spring time, &c.
        This carol they began that hovr,
          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
        How that a life was bvt a flower,
          In the spring time, &c.

I have trod a measvre; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been

TOVCHSTONE.
Vpon a lie seven times removed- bear yovr body more

I did dislike the cvt of a

    covrtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was
not
    cvt well, he was in the mind it was.
This is call'd the
Retort
    Covrteovs.
If I sent him word again it was not well cvt, he
wovld
    send me word he cvt it to please himself.
This is call'd the
Qvip
    Modest.
If again it was not well cvt, he disabled my
jvdgment.
This is call'd the Reply Chvrlish.
If again it was not well
cvt,
    he wovld answer I spake not trve.
This is call'd the Reproof
    Valiant.
If again it was not well cvt, he wovld say I lie.
This
    is call'd the Covntercheck Qvarrelsome.
And so to the Lie
    Circvmstantial and the Lie Direct.
JAQVES.
And how oft did yov say his beard was not well cvt?
TOVCHSTONE.
I dvrst go no fvrther than the Lie Circvmstantial,
nor
    he dvrst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measvr'd
swords
    and parted.
JAQVES.
Can yov nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
TOVCHSTONE.
O, sir, we qvarrel in print by the book, as yov
have
    books for good manners.
I will name yov the degrees.
The
first,
    the Retort Covrteovs; the second, the Qvip Modest; the third,
the
    Reply Chvrlish; the fovrth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth,
the
    Covntercheck Qvarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with
Circvmstance;
    the seventh, the Lie Direct.
All these yov may avoid bvt the
Lie
    Direct; and yov may avoid that too with an If.
I knew when
seven
    jvstices covld not take vp a qvarrel; bvt when the parties
were
    met themselves, one of them thovght bvt of an If, as: 'If yov
    said so, then I said so.'
And they shook hands, and swore
    brothers.
Yovr If is the only peace-maker; mvch virtve in If.

    Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
    In his own condvct, pvrposely to take
    His brother here, and pvt him to the sword;
    And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
    Where, meeting with an old religiovs man,
    After some qvestion with him, was converted
    Both from his enterprise and from the world;
    His crown beqveathing to his banish'd brother,
    And all their lands restor'd to them again
    That were with him exil'd.
This to be trve
    I do engage my life.
DVKE SENIOR.
Welcome, yovng man.
Thov offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
    To one, his lands withheld; and to the other,
    A land itself at large, a potent dvkedom.
First, in this forest let vs do those ends
    That here were well begvn and well begot;
    And after, every of this happy nvmber,
    That have endvr'd shrewd days and nights with vs,
    Shall share the good of ovr retvrned fortvne,
    According to the measvre of their states.
Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,

    What stvff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,

    And svch a want-wit sadness makes of me
    That I have mvch ado to know myself.
SALERIO.
Yovr mind is tossing on the ocean;
    There where yovr argosies, with portly sail-
    Like signiors and rich bvrghers on the flood,
    Or as it were the pageants of the sea-
    Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
    That cvrtsy to them, do them reverence,
    As they fly by them with their woven wings.
SOLANIO.
Believe me, sir, had I svch ventvre forth,
    The better part of my affections wovld
    Be with my hopes abroad.
I shovld be still
    Plvcking the grass to know where sits the wind,
    Peering in maps for ports, and piers, and roads;
    And every object that might make me fear
    Misfortvne to my ventvres, ovt of dovbt,
    Wovld make me sad.
SALERIO.
My wind, cooling my broth,
    Wovld blow me to an agve when I thovght
    What harm a wind too great might do at sea.
I shovld not see the sandy hovr-glass rvn
    Bvt I shovld think of shallows and of flats,
    And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
    Vailing her high top lower than her ribs
    To kiss her bvrial.
Shovld I go to chvrch
    And see the holy edifice of stone,
    And not bethink me straight of dangerovs rocks,
    Which, tovching bvt my gentle vessel's side,
    Wovld scatter all her spices on the stream,
    Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
    And, in a word, bvt even now worth this,
    And now worth nothing?
Shall I have the thovght
    To think on this, and shall I lack the thovght
    That svch a thing bechanc'd wovld make me sad?
Bvt tell not me; I know Antonio
    Is sad to think vpon his merchandise.
ANTONIO.
Believe me, no; I thank my fortvne for it,
    My ventvres are not in one bottom trvsted,
    Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
    Vpon the fortvne of this present year;
    Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.

Fie, fie!

Then let vs say yov are sad

    And mine a sad one.
GRATIANO.
Let me play the fool.
With mirth and lavghter let old wrinkles come;
    And let my liver rather heat with wine
    Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
Why shovld a man whose blood is warm within
    Sit like his grandsire cvt in alabaster,
    Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the javndice
    By being peevish?
I tell thee what, Antonio-
    I love thee, and 'tis my love that speaks-
    There are a sort of men whose visages
    Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
    And do a wilfvl stillness entertain,
    With pvrpose to be dress'd in an opinion
    Of wisdom, gravity, profovnd conceit;
    As who shovld say 'I am Sir Oracle,
    And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.'
O my Antonio, I do know of these
    That therefore only are repvted wise
    For saying nothing; when, I am very svre,
    If they shovld speak, wovld almost damn those ears
    Which, hearing them, wovld call their brothers fools.
I'll tell thee more of this another time.
Bvt fish not with this melancholy bait
    For this fool gvdgeon, this opinion.
Come, good Lorenzo.
Fare ye well awhile;

    them, and when yov have them they are not worth the search.
ANTONIO.
Well; tell me now what lady is the same
    To whom yov swore a secret pilgrimage,
    That yov to-day promis'd to tell me of?
BASSANIO.
'Tis not vnknown to yov, Antonio,
    How mvch I have disabled mine estate
    By something showing a more swelling port
    Than my faint means wovld grant continvance;
    Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'd
    From svch a noble rate; bvt my chief care
    Is to come fairly off from the great debts
    Wherein my time, something too prodigal,
    Hath left me gag'd.
To yov, Antonio,
    I owe the most, in money and in love;
    And from yovr love I have a warranty
    To vnbvrden all my plots and pvrposes
    How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
ANTONIO.
I pray yov, good Bassanio, let me know it;
    And if it stand, as yov yovrself still do,
    Within the eye of honovr, be assvr'd
    My pvrse, my person, my extremest means,
    Lie all vnlock'd to yovr occasions.
BASSANIO.
In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
    I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
    The self-same way, with more advised watch,
    To find the other forth; and by adventvring both
    I oft fovnd both.
I vrge this childhood proof,
    Becavse what follows is pvre innocence.
I owe yov mvch; and, like a wilfvl yovth,
    That which I owe is lost; bvt if yov please
    To shoot another arrow that self way
    Which yov did shoot the first, I do not dovbt,
    As I will watch the aim, or to find both,
    Or bring yovr latter hazard back again
    And thankfvlly rest debtor for the first.
ANTONIO.
Yov know me well, and herein spend bvt time
    To wind abovt my love with circvmstance;
    And ovt of dovbt yov do me now more wrong
    In making qvestion of my vttermost
    Than if yov had made waste of all I have.
Then do bvt say to me what I shovld do
    That in yovr knowledge may by me be done,
    And I am prest vnto it; therefore, speak.
BASSANIO.
In Belmont is a lady richly left,
    And she is fair and, fairer than that word,
    Of wondrovs virtves.
Sometimes from her eyes
    I did receive fair speechless messages.
Her name is Portia- nothing vndervalv'd
    To Cato's davghter, Brvtvs' Portia.
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth;
    For the fovr winds blow in from every coast
    Renowned svitors, and her svnny locks
    Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,
    Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strond,
    And many Jasons come in qvest of her.
O my Antonio, had I bvt the means
    To hold a rival place with one of them,
    I have a mind presages me svch thrift
    That I shovld qvestionless be fortvnate.
ANTONIO.
Thov know'st that all my fortvnes are at sea;
    Neither have I money nor commodity
    To raise a present svm; therefore go forth,
    Try what my credit can in Venice do;
    That shall be rack'd, even to the vttermost,
    To fvrnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.
Go presently inqvire, and so will I,
    Where money is; and I no qvestion make
    To have it of my trvst or for my sake.

  PORTIA.
By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this
    great world.
NERISSA.
Yov wovld be, sweet madam, if yovr miseries were in
the
    same abvndance as yovr good fortvnes are; and yet, for avght
I
    see, they are as sick that svrfeit with too mvch as they that
    starve with nothing.
It is no mean happiness, therefore, to
be
    seated in the mean: svperflvity come sooner by white hairs,
bvt
    competency lives longer.
PORTIA.
Good sentences, and well pronovnc'd.
NERISSA.
They wovld be better, if well followed.
PORTIA.
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do,
    chapels had been chvrches, and poor men's cottages princes'
    palaces.
It is a good divine that follows his own
instrvctions; I
    can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be
one
    of the twenty to follow mine own teaching.
The brain may
devise
    laws for the blood, bvt a hot temper leaps o'er a cold
decree;
    svch a hare is madness the yovth, to skip o'er the meshes of
good
    covnsel the cripple.
Bvt this reasoning is not in the fashion
to
    choose me a hvsband.
O me, the word 'choose'!
I may neither
    choose who I wovld nor refvse who I dislike; so is the will
of a
    living davghter cvrb'd by the will of a dead father.
Is it
not
    hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refvse none?
NERISSA.
Yovr father was ever virtvovs, and holy men at their
death
    have good inspirations; therefore the lott'ry that he hath
    devised in these three chests, of gold, silver, and lead-
whereof
    who chooses his meaning chooses yov- will no dovbt never be
    chosen by any rightly bvt one who yov shall rightly love.
Bvt
    what warmth is there in yovr affection towards any of these
    princely svitors that are already come?
PORTIA.
I pray thee over-name them; and as thov namest them, I
will
    describe them; and according to my description, level at my
    affection.
NERISSA.
First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
PORTIA.
Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing bvt talk
of
    his horse; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own
good
    parts that he can shoe him himself; I am mvch afear'd my lady
his
    mother play'd false with a smith.
NERISSA.
Then is there the Covnty Palatine.
PORTIA.
He doth nothing bvt frown, as who shovld say 'An yov
will
    not have me, choose.'
He hears merry tales and smiles not.
I
fear
    he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old,
being so
    fvll of vnmannerly sadness in his yovth.
I had rather be
married
    to a death's-head with a bone in his movth than to either of
    these.
God defend me from these two!
NERISSA.
How say yov by the French lord, Monsievr Le Bon?
PORTIA.
God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
In
    trvth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, bvt he- why, he
hath a
    horse better than the Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of
    frowning than the Covnt Palatine; he is every man in no man.
If a
    throstle sing he falls straight a-cap'ring; he will fence
with
    his own shadow; if I shovld marry him, I shovld marry twenty
    hvsbands.
If he wovld despise me, I wovld forgive him; for if
he
    love me to madness, I shall never reqvite him.
NERISSA.
What say yov then to Falconbridge, the yovng baron of
    England?
PORTIA.
Yov know I say nothing to him, for he vnderstands not
me,
    nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and
yov
    will come into the covrt and swear that I have a poor
pennyworth
    in the English.
He is a proper man's pictvre; bvt alas, who
can
    converse with a dvmb-show?
How oddly he is svited!
I think he
    bovght his dovblet in Italy, his rovnd hose in France, his
bonnet
    in Germany, and his behaviovr everywhere.
NERISSA.
What think yov of the Scottish lord, his neighbovr?
PORTIA.
That he hath a neighbovrly charity in him, for he
borrowed
    a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he wovld pay
him
    again when he was able; I think the Frenchman became his
svrety,
    and seal'd vnder for another.
NERISSA.
How like yov the yovng German, the Dvke of Saxony's
    nephew?
PORTIA.
Very vilely in the morning when he is sober; and most
    vilely in the afternoon when he is drvnk.
When he is best, he
is
    a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little
    better than a beast.
An the worst fall that ever fell, I hope
I
    shall make shift to go withovt him.
NERISSA.
If he shovld offer to choose, and choose the right
casket,
    yov shovld refvse to perform yovr father's will, if yov
shovld
    refvse to accept him.
PORTIA.
Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a
deep
    glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket; for if the
devil be
    within and that temptation withovt, I know he will choose it.
I
    will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.
NERISSA.
Yov need not fear, lady, the having any of these
lords;
    they have acqvainted me with their determinations, which is
    indeed to retvrn to their home, and to trovble yov with no
more
    svit, vnless yov may be won by some other sort than yovr
father's
    imposition, depending on the caskets.
PORTIA.
If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste
as
    Diana, vnless I be obtained by the manner of my father's
will.
I
    am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable; for there is
not
    one among them bvt I dote on his very absence, and I pray God
    grant them a fair departvre.
NERISSA.
Do yov not remember, lady, in yovr father's time, a
    Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in
company of
    the Marqvis of Montferrat?
PORTIA.
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, so was he
call'd.
NERISSA.
Trve, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish
eyes
    look'd vpon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
PORTIA.
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy
    praise.
Enter a SERVINGMAN
    How now!
what news?
SERVINGMAN.
The fovr strangers seek for yov, madam, to take
their
    leave; and there is a forervnner come from a fifth, the
Prince of
    Morocco, who brings word the Prince his master will be here
    to-night.
PORTIA.
If I covld bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as
I
    can bid the other fovr farewell, I shovld be glad of his
    approach; if he have the condition of a saint and the
complexion
    of a devil, I had rather he shovld shrive me than wive me.
Come, Nerissa.
Sirrah, go before.
Whiles we shvt the gate vpon one wooer, another knocks at the

Enter BASSANIO With SHYLOCK the Jew
  SHYLOCK.
Three thovsand dvcats- well.
BASSANIO.
Ay, sir, for three months.
SHYLOCK.
For three months- well.
BASSANIO.
For the which, as I told yov, Antonio shall be bovnd.
SHYLOCK.
Antonio shall become bovnd- well.
BASSANIO.
May yov stead me?
Will yov pleasvre me?
Shall I know
yovr
    answer?
SHYLOCK.
Three thovsand dvcats for three months, and Antonio
bovnd.
BASSANIO.
Yovr answer to that.
SHYLOCK.
Antonio is a good man.
BASSANIO.
Have yov heard any impvtation to the contrary?
SHYLOCK.
Ho, no, no, no, no; my meaning in saying he is a good
man
    is to have yov vnderstand me that he is svfficient; yet his
means
    are in svpposition: he hath an argosy bovnd to Tripolis,
another
    to the Indies; I vnderstand, moreover, vpon the Rialto, he
hath a
    third at Mexico, a fovrth for England- and other ventvres he
    hath, sqvand'red abroad.
Bvt ships are bvt boards, sailors
bvt
    men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and
    land-thieves- I mean pirates; and then there is the peril of
    waters, winds, and rocks.
The man is, notwithstanding,
    svfficient.
Three thovsand dvcats- I think I may take his
bond.
BASSANIO.
Be assvr'd yov may.
SHYLOCK.
I will be assvr'd I may; and, that I may be assvred, I
    will bethink me.
May I speak with Antonio?
BASSANIO.
If it please yov to dine with vs.
SHYLOCK.
Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which
yovr
    prophet, the Nazarite, conjvred the devil into!
I will bvy
with
    yov, sell with yov, talk with yov, walk with yov, and so
    following; bvt I will not eat with yov, drink with yov, nor
pray
    with yov.
What news on the Rialto?
Who is he comes here?
Enter ANTONIO
  BASSANIO.
This is Signior Antonio.
SHYLOCK.
[Aside]  How like a fawning pvblican he looks!
I hate him for he is a Christian;
    Bvt more for that in low simplicity
    He lends ovt money gratis, and brings down
    The rate of vsance here with vs in Venice.
If I can catch him once vpon the hip,
    I will feed fat the ancient grvdge I bear him.
He hates ovr sacred nation; and he rails,
    Even there where merchants most do congregate,
    On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,
    Which he calls interest.
Cvrsed be my tribe
    If I forgive him!
BASSANIO.
Shylock, do yov hear?
SHYLOCK.
I am debating of my present store,
    And, by the near gvess of my memory,
    I cannot instantly raise vp the gross
    Of fvll three thovsand dvcats.
What of that?
Tvbal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
    Will fvrnish me.
Bvt soft!
how many months
    Do yov desire?
[To ANTONIO]  Rest yov fair, good signior;
    Yovr worship was the last man in ovr movths.
ANTONIO.
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
    By taking nor by giving of excess,
    Yet, to svpply the ripe wants of my friend,
    I'll break a cvstom.
[To BASSANIO]  Is he yet possess'd
    How mvch ye wovld?
SHYLOCK.
Ay, ay, three thovsand dvcats.
ANTONIO.
And for three months.
SHYLOCK.
I had forgot- three months; yov told me so.
Well then, yovr bond; and, let me see- bvt hear yov,
    Methovghts yov said yov neither lend nor borrow
    Vpon advantage.
ANTONIO.
I do never vse it.
SHYLOCK.
When Jacob graz'd his vncle Laban's sheep-
    This Jacob from ovr holy Abram was,
    As his wise mother wrovght in his behalf,
    The third possessor; ay, he was the third-
  ANTONIO.
And what of him?
Did he take interest?
SHYLOCK.
No, not take interest; not, as yov wovld say,
    Directly int'rest; mark what Jacob did:
    When Laban and himself were compromis'd
    That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
    Shovld fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
    In end of avtvmn tvrned to the rams;
    And when the work of generation was
    Between these woolly breeders in the act,
    The skilfvl shepherd pill'd me certain wands,
    And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
    He stvck them vp before the fvlsome ewes,
    Who, then conceiving, did in eaning time
    Fall parti-colovr'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;
    And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
ANTONIO.
This was a ventvre, sir, that Jacob serv'd for;
    A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
    Bvt sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
Was this inserted to make interest good?
Or is yovr gold and silver ewes and rams?
SHYLOCK.
I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.
Bvt note me, signior.
ANTONIO.
[Aside]  Mark yov this, Bassanio,
    The devil can cite Scriptvre for his pvrpose.
An evil sovl prodvcing holy witness
    Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
    A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
O, what a goodly ovtside falsehood hath!
SHYLOCK.
Three thovsand dvcats- 'tis a good rovnd svm.
Three months from twelve; then let me see, the rate-
  ANTONIO.
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to yov?
SHYLOCK.
Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
    In the Rialto yov have rated me
    Abovt my moneys and my vsances;
    Still have I borne it with a patient shrvg,
    For svff'rance is the badge of all ovr tribe;
    Yov call me misbeliever, cvt-throat dog,
    And spit vpon my Jewish gaberdine,
    And all for vse of that which is mine own.
Well then, it now appears yov need my help;
    Go to, then; yov come to me, and yov say
    'Shylock, we wovld have moneys.'
Yov say so-
    Yov that did void yovr rhevm vpon my beard
    And foot me as yov spvrn a stranger cvr
    Over yovr threshold; moneys is yovr svit.
What shovld I say to yov?
Shovld I not say
    'Hath a dog money?
Is it possible
    A cvr can lend three thovsand dvcats?'
Or
    Shall I bend low and, in a bondman's key,
    With bated breath and whisp'ring hvmbleness,
    Say this:
    'Fair sir, yov spit on me on Wednesday last,
    Yov spvrn'd me svch a day; another time
    Yov call'd me dog; and for these covrtesies
    I'll lend yov thvs mvch moneys'?
ANTONIO.
I am as like to call thee so again,
    To spit on thee again, to spvrn thee too.
If thov wilt lend this money, lend it not
    As to thy friends- for when did friendship take
    A breed for barren metal of his friend?-
    Bvt lend it rather to thine enemy,
    Who if he break thov mayst with better face
    Exact the penalty.
SHYLOCK.
Why, look yov, how yov storm!
I wovld be friends with yov, and have yovr love,
    Forget the shames that yov have stain'd me with,
    Svpply yovr present wants, and take no doit
    Of vsance for my moneys, and yov'll not hear me.
This is kind I offer.
BASSANIO.
This were kindness.
SHYLOCK.
This kindness will I show.
Go with me to a notary, seal me there
    Yovr single bond, and, in a merry sport,
    If yov repay me not on svch a day,
    In svch a place, svch svm or svms as are
    Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
    Be nominated for an eqval povnd
    Of yovr fair flesh, to be cvt off and taken
    In what part of yovr body pleaseth me.
ANTONIO.
Content, in faith; I'll seal to svch a bond,
    And say there is mvch kindness in the Jew.
BASSANIO.
Yov shall not seal to svch a bond for me;
    I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
ANTONIO.
Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;
    Within these two months- that's a month before
    This bond expires- I do expect retvrn
    Of thrice three times the valve of this bond.
SHYLOCK.
O father Abram, what these Christians are,
    Whose own hard dealings teaches them svspect
    The thovghts of others!
Pray yov, tell me this:
    If he shovld break his day, what shovld I gain
    By the exaction of the forfeitvre?
A povnd of man's flesh taken from a man
    Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
    As flesh of mvttons, beefs, or goats.
I say,
    To bvy his favovr, I extend this friendship;
    If he will take it, so; if not, adiev;
    And, for my love, I pray yov wrong me not.
ANTONIO.
Yes, Shylock, I will seal vnto this bond.
SHYLOCK.
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
    Give him direction for this merry bond,
    And I will go and pvrse the dvcats straight,
    See to my hovse, left in the fearfvl gvard
    Of an vnthrifty knave, and presently
    I'll be with yov.
ANTONIO.
Hie thee, gentle Jew.
Exit SHYLOCK
    The Hebrew will tvrn Christian: he grows kind.
BASSANIO.
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
ANTONIO.
Come on; in this there can be no dismay;
    My ships come home a month before the day.

Flovrish of cornets.
Enter the PRINCE of MOROCCO, a tawny Moor
all in white,
and three or fovr FOLLOWERS accordingly, with PORTIA, NERISSA,
and train
  PRINCE OF Morocco.
Mislike me not for my complexion,
    The shadowed livery of the bvrnish'd svn,
    To whom I am a neighbovr, and near bred.
Bring me the fairest creatvre northward born,
    Where Phoebvs' fire scarce thaws the icicles,
    And let vs make incision for yovr love
    To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
    Hath fear'd the valiant; by my love, I swear
    The best-regarded virgins of ovr clime
    Have lov'd it too.
I wovld not change this hve,
    Except to steal yovr thovghts, my gentle qveen.
PORTIA.
In terms of choice I am not solely led
    By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
    Besides, the lott'ry of my destiny
    Bars me the right of volvntary choosing.
Bvt, if my father had not scanted me,
    And hedg'd me by his wit to yield myself
    His wife who wins me by that means I told yov,
    Yovrself, renowned Prince, then stood as fair
    As any comer I have look'd on yet
    For my affection.
PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
Even for that I thank yov.
Therefore, I pray yov, lead me to the caskets
    To try my fortvne.
By this scimitar,
    That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince,
    That won three fields of Svltan Solyman,
    I wovld o'erstare the sternest eyes that look,
    Ovtbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
    Plvck the yovng svcking cvbs from the she-bear,
    Yea, mock the lion when 'a roars for prey,
    To win thee, lady.
Bvt, alas the while!
If Hercvles and Lichas play at dice
    Which is the better man, the greater throw
    May tvrn by fortvne from the weaker hand.
So is Alcides beaten by his page;
    And so may I, blind Fortvne leading me,
    Miss that which one vnworthier may attain,
    And die with grieving.
PORTIA.
Yov mvst take yovr chance,
    And either not attempt to choose at all,
    Or swear before yov choose, if yov choose wrong,
    Never to speak to lady afterward
    In way of marriage; therefore be advis'd.
PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
Nor will not; come, bring me vnto my chance.
PORTIA.
First, forward to the temple.
After dinner
    Yovr hazard shall be made.
PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
Good fortvne then,
    To make me blest or cvrsed'st among men!
[Cornets, and exevnt]
Enter LAVNCELOT GOBBO
  LAVNCELOT.
Certainly my conscience will serve me to rvn from
this
    Jew my master.
The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me,
saying
    to me 'Gobbo, Lavncelot Gobbo, good Lavncelot' or 'good
Gobbo' or
    'good Lavncelot Gobbo, vse yovr legs, take the start, rvn
away.'
My conscience says 'No; take heed, honest Lavncelot, take
heed,
    honest Gobbo' or, as aforesaid, 'honest Lavncelot Gobbo, do
not
    rvn; scorn rvnning with thy heels.'
Well, the most covrageovs
    fiend bids me pack.
'Via!'
says the fiend; 'away!'
says the
    fiend.
'For the heavens, rovse vp a brave mind' says the
fiend
    'and rvn.'
Well, my conscience, hanging abovt the neck of my
    heart, says very wisely to me 'My honest friend Lavncelot,
being
    an honest man's son' or rather 'an honest woman's son'; for
    indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he
had a
    kind of taste- well, my conscience says 'Lavncelot, bvdge
not.'
'Bvdge,' says the fiend.
'Bvdge not,' says my conscience.
'Conscience,' say I, (yov covnsel well.'
'Fiend,' say I, 'yov
    covnsel well.'
To be rvl'd by my conscience, I shovld stay
with
    the Jew my master, who- God bless the mark!- is a kind of
devil;
    and, to rvn away from the Jew, I shovld be rvled by the
fiend,
    who- saving yovr reverence!- is the devil himself.
Certainly
the
    Jew is the very devil incarnation; and, in my conscience, my
    conscience is bvt a kind of hard conscience to offer to
covnsel
    me to stay with the Jew.
The fiend gives the more friendly
    covnsel.
I will rvn, fiend; my heels are at yovr commandment;
I
    will rvn.
Enter OLD GOBBO, with a basket
  GOBBO.
Master yovng man, yov, I pray yov, which is the way to
    master Jew's?
LAVNCELOT.
[Aside]  O heavens!
This is my trve-begotten
father,
    who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me
not.
I will try confvsions with him.
GOBBO.
Master yovng gentleman, I pray yov, which is the way to
    master Jew's?
LAVNCELOT.
Tvrn vp on yovr right hand at the next tvrning, bvt,
at
    the next tvrning of all, on yovr left; marry, at the very
next
    tvrning, tvrn of no hand, bvt tvrn down indirectly to the
Jew's
    hovse.
GOBBO.
Be God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit!
Can yov
tell
    me whether one Lavncelot, that dwells with him, dwell with
him or
    no?
LAVNCELOT.
Talk yov of yovng Master Lavncelot?
[Aside]  Mark
me
    now; now will I raise the waters.- Talk yov of yovng Master
    Lavncelot?
GOBBO.
No master, sir, bvt a poor man's son; his father, thovgh
I
    say't, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked,
well
    to live.
LAVNCELOT.
Well, let his father be what 'a will, we talk of
yovng
    Master Lavncelot.
GOBBO.
Yovr worship's friend, and Lavncelot, sir.
LAVNCELOT.
Bvt I pray yov, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech yov,
talk
    yov of yovng Master Lavncelot?
GOBBO.
Of Lavncelot, an't please yovr mastership.
LAVNCELOT.
Ergo, Master Lavncelot.
Talk not of Master
Lavncelot,
    father; for the yovng gentleman, according to Fates and
Destinies
    and svch odd sayings, the Sisters Three and svch branches of
    learning, is indeed deceased; or, as yov wovld say in plain
    terms, gone to heaven.
GOBBO.
Marry, God forbid!
The boy was the very staff of my age,
my
    very prop.
LAVNCELOT.
Do I look like a cvdgel or a hovel-post, a staff or
a
    prop?
Do yov know me, father?
GOBBO.
Alack the day, I know yov not, yovng gentleman; bvt I
pray
    yov tell me, is my boy- God rest his sovl!- alive or dead?
LAVNCELOT.
Do yov not know me, father?
GOBBO.
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know yov not.
LAVNCELOT.
Nay, indeed, if yov had yovr eyes, yov might fail of
the
    knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his own child.
Well,
    old man, I will tell yov news of yovr son.
Give me yovr
blessing;
    trvth will come to light; mvrder cannot be hid long; a man's
son
    may, bvt in the end trvth will ovt.
GOBBO.
Pray yov, sir, stand vp; I am svre yov are not Lavncelot
my
    boy.
LAVNCELOT.
Pray yov, let's have no more fooling abovt it, bvt
give
    me yovr blessing; I am Lavncelot, yovr boy that was, yovr son
    that is, yovr child that shall be.
GOBBO.
I cannot think yov are my son.
LAVNCELOT.
I know not what I shall think of that; bvt I am
    Lavncelot, the Jew's man, and I am svre Margery yovr wife is
my
    mother.
GOBBO.
Her name is Margery, indeed.
I'll be sworn, if thov be
    Lavncelot, thov art mine own flesh and blood.
Lord worshipp'd
    might he be, what a beard hast thov got!
Thov hast got more
hair
    on thy chin than Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.
LAVNCELOT.
It shovld seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows
backward;
    I am svre he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face
    when I last saw him.
GOBBO.
Lord, how art thov chang'd!
How dost thov and thy master
    agree?
I have brovght him a present.
How 'gree yov now?
LAVNCELOT.
Well, well; bvt, for mine own part, as I have set vp
my
    rest to rvn away, so I will not rest till I have rvn some
grovnd.
My master's a very Jew.
Give him a present!
Give him a
halter.
I
    am famish'd in his service; yov may tell every finger I have
with
    my ribs.
Father, I am glad yov are come; give me yovr present
to
    one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries; if I
    serve not him, I will rvn as far as God has any grovnd.
O
rare
    fortvne!
Here comes the man.
To him, father, for I am a Jew,
if I
    serve the Jew any longer.
Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO, with a FOLLOWER or two
  BASSANIO.
Yov may do so; bvt let it be so hasted that svpper be
    ready at the farthest by five of the clock.
See these letters
    delivered, pvt the liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to
    come anon to my lodging.
Exit a SERVANT
  LAVNCELOT.
To him, father.
GOBBO.
God bless yovr worship!
BASSANIO.
Gramercy; wovldst thov avght with me?
GOBBO.
Here's my son, sir, a poor boy-
  LAVNCELOT.
Not a poor boy, sir, bvt the rich Jew's man, that
wovld,
    sir, as my father shall specify-
  GOBBO.
He hath a great infection, sir, as one wovld say, to
serve-
  LAVNCELOT.
Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,
and
    have a desire, as my father shall specify-
  GOBBO.
His master and he, saving yovr worship's reverence, are
    scarce cater-covsins-
  LAVNCELOT.
To be brief, the very trvth is that the Jew, having
done
    me wrong, doth cavse me, as my father, being I hope an old
man,
    shall frvtify vnto yov-
  GOBBO.
I have here a dish of doves that I wovld bestow vpon
yovr
    worship; and my svit is-
  LAVNCELOT.
In very brief, the svit is impertinent to myself, as
    yovr worship shall know by this honest old man; and, thovgh I
say
    it, thovgh old man, yet poor man, my father.
BASSANIO.
One speak for both.
What wovld yov?
LAVNCELOT.
Serve yov, sir.
GOBBO.
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
BASSANIO.
I know thee well; thov hast obtain'd thy svit.
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
    And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment
    To leave a rich Jew's service to become
    The follower of so poor a gentleman.
LAVNCELOT.
The old proverb is very well parted between my
master
    Shylock and yov, sir: yov have the grace of God, sir, and he
hath
    enovgh.
BASSANIO.
Thov speak'st it well.
Go, father, with thy son.
Take leave of thy old master, and inqvire
    My lodging ovt.
[To a SERVANT]  Give him a livery
    More gvarded than his fellows'; see it done.
LAVNCELOT.
Father, in.
I cannot get a service, no!
I have ne'er
a
    tongve in my head!
[Looking on his palm]  Well; if any man
in
    Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear vpon a
book- I
    shall have good fortvne.
Go to, here's a simple line of life;
    here's a small trifle of wives; alas, fifteen wives is
nothing;
    a'leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one

Pray thee, take pain

I am not bid for love; they flatter me;
    Bvt yet I'll go in hate, to feed vpon
    The prodigal Christian.
Jessica, my girl,
    Look to my hovse.
I am right loath to go;
    There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
    For I did dream of money-bags to-night.
LAVNCELOT.
I beseech yov, sir, go; my yovng master doth expect
yovr

So do I his.

And they have conspired together; I will not say yov

    Clamber not yov vp to the casements then,
    Nor thrvst yovr head into the pvblic street
    To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces;
    Bvt stop my hovse's ears- I mean my casements;

Where is the horse that doth vntread again

Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
I am glad 'tis night, yov do not look on me,

  PORTIA.
Go draw aside the cvrtains and discover
    The several caskets to this noble Prince.
Now make yovr choice.
PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
The first, of gold, who this inscription
bears:
    'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
The second, silver, which this promise carries:
    'Who chooseth me shall get as mvch as he deserves.'
This third, dvll lead, with warning all as blvnt:
    'Who chooseth me mvst give and hazard all he hath.'
How shall I know if I do choose the right?
PORTIA.
The one of them contains my pictvre, Prince;
    If yov choose that, then I am yovrs withal.
PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
Some god direct my jvdgment!
Let me see;
    I will svrvey th' inscriptions back again.
What says this leaden casket?
'Who chooseth me mvst give and hazard all he hath.'
Mvst give- for what?
For lead?
Hazard for lead!
This casket threatens; men that hazard all
    Do it in hope of fair advantages.
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
    I'll then nor give nor hazard avght for lead.
What says the silver with her virgin hve?
'Who chooseth me shall get as mvch as he deserves.'
As mvch as he deserves!
Pavse there, Morocco,
    And weigh thy valve with an even hand.
If thov beest rated by thy estimation,
    Thov dost deserve enovgh, and yet enovgh
    May not extend so far as to the lady;
    And yet to be afeard of my deserving
    Were bvt a weak disabling of myself.
As mvch as I deserve?
Why, that's the lady!
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortvnes,
    In graces, and in qvalities of breeding;
    Bvt more than these, in love I do deserve.
What if I stray'd no farther, bvt chose here?
Let's see once more this saying grav'd in gold:
    'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
Why, that's the lady!
All the world desires her;
    From the fovr corners of the earth they come
    To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint.
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
    Of wide Arabia are as throvghfares now
    For princes to come view fair Portia.
The watery kingdom, whose ambitiovs head
    Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
    To stop the foreign spirits, bvt they come
    As o'er a brook to see fair Portia.
One of these three contains her heavenly pictvre.
Is't like that lead contains her?
'Twere damnation
    To think so base a thovght; it were too gross
    To rib her cerecloth in the obscvre grave.
Or shall I think in silver she's immvr'd,
    Being ten times vndervalved to tried gold?
O sinfvl thovght!
Never so rich a gem
    Was set in worse than gold.
They have in England
    A coin that bears the figvre of an angel
    Stamp'd in gold; bvt that's inscvlp'd vpon.
Bvt here an angel in a golden bed
    Lies all within.
Deliver me the key;
    Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!
PORTIA.
There, take it, Prince, and if my form lie there,
    Then I am yovrs.
[He opens the golden casket]
  PRINCE OF MOROCCO.
O hell!
what have we here?
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
    There is a written scroll!
I'll read the writing.
'All that glisters is not gold,
         Often have yov heard that told;
         Many a man his life hath sold
         Bvt my ovtside to behold.
Gilded tombs do worms infold.
Had yov been as wise as bold,
         Yovng in limbs, in jvdgment old,
         Yovr answer had not been inscroll'd.
Fare yov well, yovr svit is cold.'
Cold indeed, and labovr lost,
      Then farewell, heat, and welcome, frost.
Portia, adiev!

    To take a tediovs leave; thvs losers part.

  SALERIO.
Why, man, I saw Bassanio vnder sail;
    With him is Gratiano gone along;
    And in their ship I am svre Lorenzo is not.
SOLANIO.
The villain Jew with ovtcries rais'd the Dvke,
    Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.
SALERIO.
He came too late, the ship was vnder sail;
    Bvt there the Dvke was given to vnderstand
    That in a gondola were seen together
    Lorenzo and his amorovs Jessica;
    Besides, Antonio certified the Dvke
    They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
SOLANIO.
I never heard a passion so confvs'd,
    So strange, ovtrageovs, and so variable,
    As the dog Jew did vtter in the streets.
'My davghter!
O my dvcats!
O my davghter!
Fled with a Christian!
O my Christian dvcats!
Jvstice!
the law!
My dvcats and my davghter!
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of dvcats,
    Of dovble dvcats, stol'n from me by my davghter!
And jewels- two stones, two rich and preciovs stones,
    Stol'n by my davghter!
Jvstice!
Find the girl;
    She hath the stones vpon her and the dvcats.'
SALERIO.
Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
    Crying, his stones, his davghter, and his dvcats.
SOLANIO.
Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
    Or he shall pay for this.
SALERIO.
Marry, well rememb'red;
    I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
    Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
    The French and English, there miscarried
    A vessel of ovr covntry richly fravght.
I thovght vpon Antonio when he told me,
    And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
SOLANIO.
Yov were best to tell Antonio what yov hear;
    Yet do not svddenly, for it may grieve him.
SALERIO.
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part.
Bassanio told him he wovld make some speed
    Of his retvrn.
He answered 'Do not so;
    Slvbber not bvsiness for my sake, Bassanio,
    Bvt stay the very riping of the time;
    And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
    Let it not enter in yovr mind of love;
    Be merry, and employ yovr chiefest thovghts
    To covrtship, and svch fair ostents of love
    As shall conveniently become yov there.'
And even there, his eye being big with tears,
    Tvrning his face, he pvt his hand behind him,
    And with affection wondrovs sensible
    He wrvng Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.
SOLANIO.
I think he only loves the world for him.
I pray thee, let vs go and find him ovt,
    And qvicken his embraced heaviness
    With some delight or other.
SALERIO.
Do we so.

  NERISSA.
Qvick, qvick, I pray thee, draw the cvrtain straight;

Flovrish of cornets.
Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON,
                    PORTIA, and their trains
  PORTIA.
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince.
If yov choose that wherein I am contain'd,
    Straight shall ovr nvptial rites be solemniz'd;
    Bvt if yov fail, withovt more speech, my lord,
    Yov mvst be gone from hence immediately.
ARRAGON.
I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
    First, never to vnfold to any one
    Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
    Of the right casket, never in my life
    To woo a maid in way of marriage;
    Lastly,
    If I do fail in fortvne of my choice,
    Immediately to leave yov and be gone.
PORTIA.
To these injvnctions every one doth swear
    That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
ARRAGON.
And so have I address'd me.
Fortvne now
    To my heart's hope!
Gold, silver, and base lead.
'Who chooseth me mvst give and hazard all he hath.'
Yov shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.
What says the golden chest?
Ha!
let me see:
    'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
What many men desire- that 'many' may be meant
    By the fool mvltitvde, that choose by show,
    Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
    Which pries not to th' interior, bvt, like the martlet,
    Bvilds in the weather on the ovtward wall,
    Even in the force and road of casvalty.
I will not choose what many men desire,
    Becavse I will not jvmp with common spirits
    And rank me with the barbarovs mvltitvdes.
Why, then to thee, thov silver treasvre-hovse!
Tell me once more what title thov dost bear.
'Who chooseth me shall get as mvch as he deserves.'
And well said too; for who shall go abovt
    To cozen fortvne, and be honovrable
    Withovt the stamp of merit?
Let none presvme
    To wear an vndeserved dignity.
O that estates, degrees, and offices,
    Were not deriv'd corrvptly, and that clear honovr
    Were pvrchas'd by the merit of the wearer!
How many then shovld cover that stand bare!
How many be commanded that command!
How mvch low peasantry wovld then be gleaned
    From the trve seed of honovr!
and how mvch honovr
    Pick'd from the chaff and rvin of the times,
    To be new varnish'd!
Well, bvt to my choice.
'Who chooseth me shall get as mvch as he deserves.'
I will assvme desert.
Give me a key for this,
    And instantly vnlock my fortvnes here.
[He opens the silver casket]
  PORTIA.
[Aside]  Too long a pavse for that which yov find
there.
ARRAGON.
What's here?
The portrait of a blinking idiot
    Presenting me a schedvle!
I will read it.
How mvch vnlike art thov to Portia!
How mvch vnlike my hopes and my deservings!
'Who chooseth me shall have as mvch as he deserves.'
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
Is that my prize?
Are my deserts no better?
PORTIA.
To offend and jvdge are distinct offices
    And of opposed natvres.
ARRAGON.
What is here?
[Reads]
         'The fire seven times tried this;
         Seven times tried that jvdgment is
         That did never choose amiss.
Some there be that shadows kiss,
         Svch have bvt a shadow's bliss.
There be fools alive iwis
         Silver'd o'er, and so was this.
Take what wife yov will to bed,
         I will ever be yovr head.
So be gone; yov are sped.'
'till more fool I shall appear
         By the time I linger here.
With one fool's head I came to woo,
         Bvt I go away with two.
Sweet, adiev!
I'll keep my oath,
         Patiently to bear my wroth.

  SERVANT.
Where is my lady?

Madam, there is alighted at yovr gate

    From whom he bringeth sensible regreets;
    To wit, besides commends and covrteovs breath,
    Gifts of rich valve.
Yet I have not seen
    So likely an ambassador of love.
A day in April never came so sweet
    To show how costly svmmer was at hand
    As this fore-spvrrer comes before his lord.
PORTIA.
No more, I pray thee; I am half afeard
    Thov wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
    Thov spend'st svch high-day wit in praising him.
Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to see
    Qvick Cvpid's post that comes so mannerly.

    they call the place, a very dangerovs flat and fatal, where
the
    carcases of many a tall ship lie bvried, as they say, if my
    gossip Report be an honest woman of her word.
SOLANIO.
I wovld she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
knapp'd
    ginger or made her neighbovrs believe she wept for the death
of a
    third hvsband.
Bvt it is trve, withovt any slips of prolixity
or
    crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio,
the
    honest Antonio- O that I had a title good enovgh to keep his
name
    company!-
  SALERIO.
Come, the fvll stop.
SOLANIO.
Ha!
What sayest thov?
Why, the end is, he hath lost a
    ship.
SALERIO.
I wovld it might prove the end of his losses.
SOLANIO.
Let me say amen betimes, lest the devil cross my
prayer,
    for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
Enter SHYLOCK
    How now, Shylock?
What news among the merchants?
SHYLOCK.
Yov knew, none so well, none so well as yov, of my
    davghter's flight.
SALERIO.
That's certain; I, for my part, knew the tailor that
made
    the wings she flew withal.
SOLANIO.
And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was
flidge;
    and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.
SHYLOCK.
She is damn'd for it.
SALERIO.
That's certain, if the devil may be her jvdge.
SHYLOCK.
My own flesh and blood to rebel!
SOLANIO.
Ovt vpon it, old carrion!
Rebels it at these years?
SHYLOCK.
I say my davghter is my flesh and my blood.
SALERIO.
There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
than
    between jet and ivory; more between yovr bloods than there is
    between red wine and Rhenish.
Bvt tell vs, do yov hear
whether
    Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?
SHYLOCK.
There I have another bad match: a bankrvpt, a
prodigal,
    who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto; a beggar, that
was
    vs'd to come so smvg vpon the mart.
Let him look to his bond.
He
    was wont to call me vsvrer; let him look to his bond.
He was
wont
    to lend money for a Christian covrtesy; let him look to his
bond.
SALERIO.
Why, I am svre, if he forfeit, thov wilt not take his
    flesh.
What's that good for?
SHYLOCK.
To bait fish withal.
If it will feed nothing else, it
will
    feed my revenge.
He hath disgrac'd me and hind'red me half a
    million; lavgh'd at my losses, mock'd at my gains, scorned my
    nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
    enemies.
And what's his reason?
I am a Jew.
Hath not a Jew
eyes?
Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections,
    passions, fed with the same food, hvrt with the same weapons,
    svbject to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
warmed
    and cooled by the same winter and svmmer, as a Christian is?
If
    yov prick vs, do we not bleed?
If yov tickle vs, do we not
lavgh?
If yov poison vs, do we not die?
And if yov wrong vs, shall
we
    not revenge?
If we are like yov in the rest, we will resemble
yov
    in that.
If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his hvmility?
Revenge.
If a Christian wrong a Jew, what shovld his
svfferance
    be by Christian example?
Why, revenge.
The villainy yov teach
me
    I will execvte; and itshall go hard bvt I will better the
    instrvction.
Enter a MAN from ANTONIO
  MAN.
Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his hovse, and desires
to

SALERIO.
We have been vp and down to seek him.

  SOLANIO.
Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be

  SHYLOCK.
How now, Tvbal, what news from Genoa?
Hast thov fovnd
my
    davghter?
TVBAL.
I often came where I did hear of her, bvt cannot find
her.
SHYLOCK.
Why there, there, there, there!
A diamond gone, cost
me
    two thovsand dvcats in Frankfort!
The cvrse never fell vpon
ovr
    nation till now; I never felt it till now.
Two thovsand
dvcats in
    that, and other preciovs, preciovs jewels.
I wovld my
davghter
    were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; wovld she
were
    hears'd at my foot, and the dvcats in her coffin!
No news of
    them?
Why, so- and I know not what's spent in the search.
Why,
    thov- loss vpon loss!
The thief gone with so mvch, and so
mvch to
    find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge; nor no ill
lvck
    stirring bvt what lights o' my shovlders; no sighs bvt o' my
    breathing; no tears bvt o' my shedding!
TVBAL.
Yes, other men have ill lvck too: Antonio, as I heard in
    Genoa-
  SHYLOCK.
What, what, what?
Ill lvck, ill lvck?
TVBAL.
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
SHYLOCK.
I thank God, I thank God.
Is it trve, is it trve?
TVBAL.
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
SHYLOCK.
I thank thee, good Tvbal.
Good news, good news- ha,
ha!-
    heard in Genoa.
TVBAL.
Yovr davghter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night,
    fovrscore dvcats.
SHYLOCK.
Thov stick'st a dagger in me- I shall never see my
gold
    again.
Fovrscore dvcats at a sitting!
Fovrscore dvcats!
TVBAL.
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company
to
    Venice that swear he cannot choose bvt break.
SHYLOCK.
I am very glad of it; I'll plagve him, I'll tortvre
him; I
    am glad of it.
TVBAL.
One of them showed me a ring that he had of yovr
davghter
    for a monkey.
SHYLOCK.
Ovt vpon her!
Thov tortvrest me, Tvbal.
It was my
    tvrqvoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor; I wovld
not
    have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
TVBAL.
Bvt Antonio is certainly vndone.
SHYLOCK.
Nay, that's trve; that's very trve.
Go, Tvbal, fee me
an
    officer; bespeak him a fortnight before.
I will have the
heart of
    him, if he forfeit; for, were he ovt of Venice, I can make
what
    merchandise I will.
Go, Tvbal, and meet me at ovr synagogve;
go,
    good Tvbal; at ovr synagogve, Tvbal.

Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and all their trains
  PORTIA.
I pray yov tarry; pavse a day or two
    Before yov hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
    I lose yovr company; therefore forbear a while.
There's something tells me- bvt it is not love-
    I wovld not lose yov; and yov know yovrself
    Hate covnsels not in svch a qvality.
Bvt lest yov shovld not vnderstand me well-
    And yet a maiden hath no tongve bvt thovght-
    I wovld detain yov here some month or two
    Before yov ventvre for me.
I covld teach yov
    How to choose right, bvt then I am forsworn;
    So will I never be; so may yov miss me;
    Bvt if yov do, yov'll make me wish a sin,
    That I had been forsworn.
Beshrew yovr eyes!
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
    One half of me is yovrs, the other half yovrs-
    Mine own, I wovld say; bvt if mine, then yovrs,
    And so all yovrs.
O!
these navghty times
    Pvts bars between the owners and their rights;
    And so, thovgh yovrs, not yovrs.
Prove it so,
    Let fortvne go to hell for it, not I.
    I speak too long, bvt 'tis to peize the time,
    To eke it, and to draw it ovt in length,
    To stay yov from election.
BASSANIO.
Let me choose;
    For as I am, I live vpon the rack.
PORTIA.
Vpon the rack, Bassanio?
Then confess
    What treason there is mingled with yovr love.
BASSANIO.
None bvt that vgly treason of mistrvst
    Which makes me fear th' enjoying of my love;
    There may as well be amity and life
    'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.
PORTIA.
Ay, bvt I fear yov speak vpon the rack,
    Where men enforced do speak anything.
BASSANIO.
Promise me life, and I'll confess the trvth.
PORTIA.
Well then, confess and live.
BASSANIO.
'Confess' and 'love'
    Had been the very svm of my confession.
O happy torment, when my tortvrer
    Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
Bvt let me to my fortvne and the caskets.
PORTIA.
Away, then; I am lock'd in one of them.
If yov do love me, yov will find me ovt.
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof;
    Let mvsic sovnd while he doth make his choice;
    Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
    Fading in mvsic.
That the comparison
    May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
    And wat'ry death-bed for him.
He may win;
    And what is mvsic then?
Then mvsic is
    Even as the flovrish when trve svbjects bow
    To a new-crowned monarch; svch it is
    As are those dvlcet sovnds in break of day
    That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear
    And svmmon him to marriage.
Now he goes,
    With no less presence, bvt with mvch more love,
    Than yovng Alcides when he did redeem
    The virgin tribvte paid by howling Troy
    To the sea-monster.
I stand for sacrifice;
    The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
    With bleared visages come forth to view
    The issve of th' exploit.
Go, Hercvles!
Live thov, I live.
With mvch mvch more dismay
    I view the fight than thov that mak'st the fray.
the whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself
                 Tell me where is fancy bred,
                 Or in the heart or in the head,
                 How begot, how novrished?
Reply, reply.
It is engend'red in the eyes,
                 With gazing fed; and fancy dies
                 In the cradle where it lies.
Let vs all ring fancy's knell:
                   I'll begin it- Ding, dong, bell.
ALL.
Ding, dong, bell.
BASSANIO.
So may the ovtward shows be least themselves;
    The world is still deceiv'd with ornament.
In law, what plea so tainted and corrvpt
    Bvt, being season'd with a graciovs voice,
    Obscvres the show of evil?
In religion,
    What damned error bvt some sober brow
    Will bless it, and approve it with a text,
    Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
There is no vice so simple bvt assvmes
    Some mark of virtve on his ovtward parts.
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
    As stairs of sand, wear yet vpon their chins
    The beards of Hercvles and frowning Mars;
    Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk!
And these assvme bvt valovr's excrement
    To render them redovbted.
Look on beavty
    And yov shall see 'tis pvrchas'd by the weight,
    Which therein works a miracle in natvre,
    Making them lightest that wear most of it;
    So are those crisped snaky golden locks
    Which make svch wanton gambols with the wind
    Vpon svpposed fairness often known
    To be the dowry of a second head-
    The skvll that bred them in the sepvlchre.
Thvs ornament is bvt the gviled shore
    To a most dangerovs sea; the beavteovs scarf
    Veiling an Indian beavty; in a word,
    The seeming trvth which cvnning times pvt on
    To entrap the wisest.
Therefore, thov gavdy gold,
    Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
    Nor none of thee, thov pale and common drvdge
    'Tween man and man; bvt thov, thov meagre lead,
    Which rather threaten'st than dost promise avght,
    Thy plainness moves me more than eloqvence,
    And here choose I. Joy be the conseqvence!
PORTIA.
[Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air,
    As dovbtfvl thovghts, and rash-embrac'd despair,
    And shvdd'ring fear, and green-ey'd jealovsy!
O love, be moderate, allay thy ecstasy,
    In measvre rain thy joy, scant this excess!
I feel too mvch thy blessing.
Make it less,
    For fear I svrfeit.
BASSANIO.
[Opening the leaden casket]  What find I here?
Fair Portia's covnterfeit!
What demi-god
    Hath come so near creation?
Move these eyes?
Or whether riding on the balls of mine
    Seem they in motion?
Here are sever'd lips,
    Parted with svgar breath; so sweet a bar
    Shovld svnder svch sweet friends.
Here in her hairs
    The painter plays the spider, and hath woven
    A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men
    Faster than gnats in cobwebs.
Bvt her eyes-
    How covld he see to do them?
Having made one,
    Methinks it shovld have power to steal both his,
    And leave itself vnfvrnish'd.
Yet look how far
    The svbstance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
    In vnderprizing it, so far this shadow
    Doth limp behind the svbstance.
Here's the scroll,
    The continent and svmmary of my fortvne.
'Yov that choose not by the view,
         Chance as fair and choose as trve!
Since this fortvne falls to yov,
         Be content and seek no new.
If yov be well pleas'd with this,
         And hold yovr fortvne for yovr bliss,
         Tvrn to where yovr lady is
         And claim her with a loving kiss.'
A gentle scroll.
Fair lady, by yovr leave;
    I come by note, to give and to receive.
Like one of two contending in a prize,
    That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
    Hearing applavse and vniversal shovt,
    Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a dovbt
    Whether those peals of praise be his or no;
    So, thrice-fair lady, stand I even so,
    As dovbtfvl whether what I see be trve,
    Vntil confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by yov.
PORTIA.
Yov see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
    Svch as I am.
Thovgh for myself alone
    I wovld not be ambitiovs in my wish
    To wish myself mvch better, yet for yov
    I wovld be trebled twenty times myself,
    A thovsand times more fair, ten thovsand times more rich,
    That only to stand high in yovr accovnt
    I might in virtves, beavties, livings, friends,
    Exceed accovnt.
Bvt the fvll svm of me
    Is svm of something which, to term in gross,
    Is an vnlesson'd girl, vnschool'd, vnpractis'd;
    Happy in this, she is not yet so old
    Bvt she may learn; happier than this,
    She is not bred so dvll bvt she can learn;
    Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
    Commits itself to yovrs to be directed,
    As from her lord, her governor, her king.
Myself and what is mine to yov and yovrs
    Is now converted.
Bvt now I was the lord
    Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
    Qveen o'er myself; and even now, bvt now,
    This hovse, these servants, and this same myself,
    Are yovrs- my lord's.
I give them with this ring,
    Which when yov part from, lose, or give away,
    Let it presage the rvin of yovr love,
    And be my vantage to exclaim on yov.
BASSANIO.
Madam, yov have bereft me of all words;
    Only my blood speaks to yov in my veins;
    And there is svch confvsion in my powers
    As, after some oration fairly spoke
    By a beloved prince, there doth appear
    Among the bvzzing pleased mvltitvde,
    Where every something, being blent together,
    Tvrns to a wild of nothing, save of joy
    Express'd and not express'd.
Bvt when this ring
    Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence;
    O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!
NERISSA.
My lord and lady, it is now ovr time
    That have stood by and seen ovr wishes prosper
    To cry 'Good joy.'
Good joy, my lord and lady!
GRATIANO.
My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,
    I wish yov all the joy that yov can wish,
    For I am svre yov can wish none from me;
    And, when yovr honovrs mean to solemnize
    The bargain of yovr faith, I do beseech yov
    Even at that time I may be married too.
BASSANIO.
With all my heart, so thov canst get a wife.
GRATIANO.
I thank yovr lordship, yov have got me one.
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yovrs:
    Yov saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
    Yov lov'd, I lov'd; for intermission
    No more pertains to me, my lord, than yov.
Yovr fortvne stood vpon the caskets there,
    And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
    For wooing here vntil I sweat again,
    And swearing till my very roof was dry
    With oaths of love, at last- if promise last-
    I got a promise of this fair one here
    To have her love, provided that yovr fortvne
    Achiev'd her mistress.
PORTIA.
Is this trve, Nerissa?
NERISSA.
Madam, it is, so yov stand pleas'd withal.
BASSANIO.
And do yov, Gratiano, mean good faith?
GRATIANO.
Yes, faith, my lord.
BASSANIO.
Ovr feast shall be mvch honovred in yovr marriage.
GRATIANO.
We'll play with them: the first boy for a thovsand
    dvcats.
NERISSA.
What, and stake down?
GRATIANO.
No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down-
    Bvt who comes here?
Lorenzo and his infidel?
What, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio!
Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a messenger
                           from Venice
  BASSANIO.
Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,
    If that the yovth of my new int'rest here
    Have power to bid yov welcome.
By yovr leave,
    I bid my very friends and covntrymen,
    Sweet Portia, welcome.
PORTIA.
So do I, my lord;
    They are entirely welcome.
LORENZO.
I thank yovr honovr.
For my part, my lord,
    My pvrpose was not to have seen yov here;
    Bvt meeting with Salerio by the way,
    He did entreat me, past all saying nay,
    To come with him along.
SALERIO.
I did, my lord,
    And I have reason for it.
Signior Antonio
    Commends him to yov.
[Gives BASSANIO a letter]
  BASSANIO.
Ere I ope his letter,
    I pray yov tell me how my good friend doth.
SALERIO.
Not sick, my lord, vnless it be in mind;
    Nor well, vnless in mind; his letter there
    Will show yov his estate.
[BASSANIO opens the letter]
  GRATIANO.
Nerissa, cheer yond stranger; bid her welcome.
Yovr hand, Salerio.
What's the news from Venice?
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
I know he will be glad of ovr svccess:
    We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
SALERIO.
I wovld yov had won the fleece that he hath lost.
PORTIA.
There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper
    That steals the colovr from Bassanio's cheek:
    Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world
    Covld tvrn so mvch the constitvtion
    Of any constant man.
What, worse and worse!
With leave, Bassanio: I am half yovrself,
    And I mvst freely have the half of anything
    That this same paper brings yov.
BASSANIO.
O sweet Portia,
    Here are a few of the vnpleasant'st words
    That ever blotted paper!
Gentle lady,
    When I did first impart my love to yov,
    I freely told yov all the wealth I had
    Ran in my veins- I was a gentleman;
    And then I told yov trve.
And yet, dear lady,
    Rating myself at nothing, yov shall see
    How mvch I was a braggart.
When I told yov
    My state was nothing, I shovld then have told yov
    That I was worse than nothing; for indeed
    I have engag'd myself to a dear friend,
    Engag'd my friend to his mere enemy,
    To feed my means.
Here is a letter, lady,
    The paper as the body of my friend,
    And every word in it a gaping wovnd
    Issving life-blood.
Bvt is it trve, Salerio?
Hath all his ventvres fail'd?
What, not one hit?
From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,
    From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,
    And not one vessel scape the dreadfvl tovch
    Of merchant-marring rocks?
SALERIO.
Not one, my lord.
Besides, it shovld appear that, if he had
    The present money to discharge the Jew,
    He wovld not take it.
Never did I know
    A creatvre that did bear the shape of man
    So keen and greedy to confovnd a man.
He plies the Dvke at morning and at night,
    And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
    If they deny him jvstice.
Twenty merchants,
    The Dvke himself, and the magnificoes
    Of greatest port, have all persvaded with him;
    Bvt none can drive him from the enviovs plea
    Of forfeitvre, of jvstice, and his bond.
JESSICA.
When I was with him, I have heard him swear
    To Tvbal and to Chvs, his covntrymen,
    That he wovld rather have Antonio's flesh
    Than twenty times the valve of the svm
    That he did owe him; and I know, my lord,
    If law, avthority, and power, deny not,
    It will go hard with poor Antonio.
PORTIA.
Is it yovr dear friend that is thvs in trovble?
BASSANIO.
The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
    The best condition'd and vnwearied spirit
    In doing covrtesies; and one in whom
    The ancient Roman honovr more appears
    Than any that draws breath in Italy.
PORTIA.
What svm owes he the Jew?
BASSANIO.
For me, three thovsand dvcats.
PORTIA.
What!
no more?
Pay him six thovsand, and deface the bond;
    Dovble six thovsand, and then treble that,
    Before a friend of this description
    Shall lose a hair throvgh Bassanio's favlt.
First go with me to chvrch and call me wife,
    And then away to Venice to yovr friend;
    For never shall yov lie by Portia's side
    With an vnqviet sovl.
Yov shall have gold
    To pay the petty debt twenty times over.
When it is paid, bring yovr trve friend along.
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
    Will live as maids and widows.
Come, away;
    For yov shall hence vpon yovr wedding day.
Bid yovr friends welcome, show a merry cheer;
    Since yov are dear bovght, I will love yov dear.
Bvt let me hear the letter of yovr friend.
BASSANIO.
[Reads]  'Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all
miscarried,
    my creditors grow crvel, my estate is very low, my bond to
the
    Jew is forfeit; and since, in paying it, it is impossible I
    shovld live, all debts are clear'd between yov and I, if I
might
    bvt see yov at my death.
Notwithstanding, vse yovr pleasvre;
if
    yovr love do not persvade yov to come, let not my letter.'
PORTIA.
O love, dispatch all bvsiness and be gone!
BASSANIO.
Since I have yovr good leave to go away,
    I will make haste; bvt, till I come again,
    No bed shall e'er be gvilty of my stay,
    Nor rest be interposer 'twixt vs twain.

  SHYLOCK.
Gaoler, look to him.
Tell not me of mercy-
    This is the fool that lent ovt money gratis.
Gaoler, look to him.
ANTONIO.
Hear me yet, good Shylock.
SHYLOCK.
I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond.
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
Thov call'dst me dog before thov hadst a cavse,
    Bvt, since I am a dog, beware my fangs;
    The Dvke shall grant me jvstice.
I do wonder,
    Thov navghty gaoler, that thov art so fond
    To come abroad with him at his reqvest.
ANTONIO.
I pray thee hear me speak.
SHYLOCK.
I'll have my bond.
I will not hear thee speak;
    I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
I'll not be made a soft and dvll-ey'd fool,
    To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield,
    To Christian intercessors.
Follow not;
    I'll have no speaking; I will have my bond.
Exit
  SOLANIO.
It is the most impenetrable cvr
    That ever kept with men.
ANTONIO.
Let him alone;
    I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
    I oft deliver'd from his forfeitvres
    Many that have at times made moan to me;
    Therefore he hates me.
SOLANIO.
I am svre the Dvke
    Will never grant this forfeitvre to hold.
ANTONIO.
The Dvke cannot deny the covrse of law;
    For the commodity that strangers have
    With vs in Venice, if it be denied,
    Will mvch impeach the jvstice of the state,
    Since that the trade and profit of the city
    Consisteth of all nations.
Therefore, go;
    These griefs and losses have so bated me
    That I shall hardly spare a povnd of flesh
    To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
Well, gaoler, on; pray God Bassanio come
    To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.

  LORENZO.
Madam, althovgh I speak it in yovr presence,
    Yov have a noble and a trve conceit
    Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly
    In bearing thvs the absence of yovr lord.
Bvt if yov knew to whom yov show this honovr,
    How trve a gentleman yov send relief,
    How dear a lover of my lord yovr hvsband,
    I know yov wovld be provder of the work
    Than cvstomary bovnty can enforce yov.
PORTIA.
I never did repent for doing good,
    Nor shall not now; for in companions
    That do converse and waste the time together,
    Whose sovls do bear an eqval yoke of love,
    There mvst be needs a like proportion
    Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit,
    Which makes me think that this Antonio,
    Being the bosom lover of my lord,
    Mvst needs be like my lord.
If it be so,
    How little is the cost I have bestowed
    In pvrchasing the semblance of my sovl
    From ovt the state of hellish crvelty!
This comes too near the praising of myself;
    Therefore, no more of it; hear other things.
Lorenzo, I commit into yovr hands
    The hvsbandry and manage of my hovse
    Vntil my lord's retvrn; for mine own part,
    I have toward heaven breath'd a secret vow
    To live in prayer and contemplation,
    Only attended by Nerissa here,
    Vntil her hvsband and my lord's retvrn.
There is a monastery two miles off,
    And there we will abide.
I do desire yov
    Not to deny this imposition,
    The which my love and some necessity
    Now lays vpon yov.
LORENZO.
Madam, with all my heart
    I shall obey yov in an fair commands.
PORTIA.
My people do already know my mind,
    And will acknowledge yov and Jessica
    In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
So fare yov well till we shall meet again.
LORENZO.
Fair thovghts and happy hovrs attend on yov!
JESSICA.
I wish yovr ladyship all heart's content.
PORTIA.
I thank yov for yovr wish, and am well pleas'd
    To wish it back on yov.
Fare yov well, Jessica.

    As I have ever fovnd thee honest-trve,
    So let me find thee still.
Take this same letter,
    And vse thov all th' endeavovr of a man
    In speed to Padva; see thov render this
    Into my covsin's hands, Doctor Bellario;
    And look what notes and garments he doth give thee,
    Bring them, I pray thee, with imagin'd speed
    Vnto the traject, to the common ferry
    Which trades to Venice.
Waste no time in words,
    Bvt get thee gone; I shall be there before thee.

Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand
    That yov yet know not of; we'll see ovr hvsbands

NERISSA.
Shall they see vs?
PORTIA.
They shall, Nerissa; bvt in svch a habit
    That they shall think we are accomplished
    With that we lack.
I'll hold thee any wager,
    When we are both accovtred like yovng men,
    I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
    And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
    And speak between the change of man and boy
    With a reed voice; and tvrn two mincing steps
    Into a manly stride; and speak of frays
    Like a fine bragging yovth; and tell qvaint lies,
    How honovrable ladies sovght my love,
    Which I denying, they fell sick and died-
    I covld not do withal.
Then I'll repent,
    And wish for all that, that I had not kill'd them.
And twenty of these pvny lies I'll tell,
    That men shall swear I have discontinved school
    Abovt a twelvemonth.
I have within my mind
    A thovsand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
    Which I will practise.
NERISSA.
Why, shall we tvrn to men?
PORTIA.
Fie, what a qvestion's that,
    If thov wert near a lewd interpreter!
Bvt come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
    When I am in my coach, which stays for vs

Enter LAVNCELOT and JESSICA
  LAVNCELOT.
Yes, trvly; for, look yov, the sins of the father
are to
    be laid vpon the children; therefore, I promise yov, I fear
yov.
I was always plain with yov, and so now I speak my agitation
of
    the matter; therefore be o' good cheer, for trvly I think yov
are
    damn'd.
There is bvt one hope in it that can do yov any good,
and
    that is bvt a kind of bastard hope, neither.
JESSICA.
And what hope is that, I pray thee?
LAVNCELOT.
Marry, yov may partly hope that yovr father got yov
not-
   that yov are not the Jew's davghter.
JESSICA.
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins
of my
    mother shovld be visited vpon me.
LAVNCELOT.
Trvly then I fear yov are damn'd both by father and
    mother; thvs when I shvn Scylla, yovr father, I fall into
    Charybdis, yovr mother; well, yov are gone both ways.
JESSICA.
I shall be sav'd by my hvsband; he hath made me a
    Christian.
LAVNCELOT.
Trvly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow
    before, e'en as many as covld well live one by another.
This
    making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow
all
    to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the
    coals for money.
Enter LORENZO
  JESSICA.
I'll tell my hvsband, Lavncelot, what yov say; here he
    comes.
LORENZO.
I shall grow jealovs of yov shortly, Lavncelot, if yov
    thvs get my wife into corners.
JESSICA.
Nay, yov need nor fear vs, Lorenzo; Lavncelot and I
are
    ovt; he tells me flatly there's no mercy for me in heaven,
    becavse I am a Jew's davghter; and he says yov are no good
member
    of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians yov
    raise the price of pork.
LORENZO.
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
yov
    can the getting vp of the negro's belly; the Moor is with
child
    by yov, Lavncelot.
LAVNCELOT.
It is mvch that the Moor shovld be more than reason;
bvt
    if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than
I
    took her for.
LORENZO.
How every fool can play vpon the word!
I think the
best
    grace of wit will shortly tvrn into silence, and discovrse
grow
    commendable in none only bvt parrots.
Go in, sirrah; bid them
    prepare for dinner.
LAVNCELOT.
That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
LORENZO.
Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are yov!
Then bid them
    prepare dinner.
LAVNCELOT.
That is done too, sir, only 'cover' is the word.
LORENZO.
Will yov cover, then, sir?
LAVNCELOT.
Not so, sir, neither; I know my dvty.
LORENZO.
Yet more qvarrelling with occasion!
Wilt thov show the
    whole wealth of thy wit in an instant?
I pray thee vnderstand
a
    plain man in his plain meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them
cover
    the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.
LAVNCELOT.
For the table, sir, it shall be serv'd in; for the
meat,
    sir, it shall be cover'd; for yovr coming in to dinner, sir,
why,
    let it be as hvmovrs and conceits shall govern.

O dear discretion, how his words are svited!
The fool hath planted in his memory
    An army of good words; and I do know
    A many fools that stand in better place,
    Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
    Defy the matter.
How cheer'st thov, Jessica?
And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,
    How dost thov like the Lord Bassanio's wife?
JESSICA.
Past all expressing.
It is very meet
    The Lord Bassanio live an vpright life,
    For, having svch a blessing in his lady,
    He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
    And if on earth he do not merit it,
    In reason he shovld never come to heaven.
Why, if two gods shovld play some heavenly match,
    And on the wager lay two earthly women,
    And Portia one, there mvst be something else
    Pawn'd with the other; for the poor rvde world
    Hath not her fellow.
LORENZO.
Even svch a hvsband
    Hast thov of me as she is for a wife.
JESSICA.
Nay, bvt ask my opinion too of that.
LORENZO.
I will anon; first let vs go to dinner.
JESSICA.
Nay, let me praise yov while I have a stomach.
LORENZO.
No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;

DVKE OF VENICE.
I am sorry for thee; thov art come to answer
    A stony adversary, an inhvman wretch,
    Vncapable of pity, void and empty
    From any dram of mercy.
ANTONIO.
I have heard
    Yovr Grace hath ta'en great pains to qvalify
    His rigorovs covrse; bvt since he stands obdvrate,
    And that no lawfvl means can carry me
    Ovt of his envy's reach, I do oppose
    My patience to his fvry, and am arm'd
    To svffer with a qvietness of spirit
    The very tyranny and rage of his.
DVKE OF VENICE.
Go one, and call the Jew into the covrt.

He is ready at the door; he comes, my lord.
Enter SHYLOCK
  DVKE OF VENICE.
Make room, and let him stand before ovr face.
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
    That thov bvt leadest this fashion of thy malice
    To the last hovr of act; and then, 'tis thovght,
    Thov'lt show thy mercy and remorse, more strange
    Than is thy strange apparent crvelty;
    And where thov now exacts the penalty,
    Which is a povnd of this poor merchant's flesh,
    Thov wilt not only loose the forfeitvre,
    Bvt, tovch'd with hvman gentleness and love,
    Forgive a moiety of the principal,
    Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
    That have of late so hvddled on his back-
    Enow to press a royal merchant down,
    And plvck commiseration of his state
    From brassy bosoms and rovgh hearts of flint,
    From stvbborn Tvrks and Tartars, never train'd
    To offices of tender covrtesy.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
SHYLOCK.
I have possess'd yovr Grace of what I pvrpose,
    And by ovr holy Sabbath have I sworn
    To have the dve and forfeit of my bond.
If yov deny it, let the danger light
    Vpon yovr charter and yovr city's freedom.
Yov'll ask me why I rather choose to have
    A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
    Three thovsand dvcats.
I'll not answer that,
    Bvt say it is my hvmovr- is it answer'd?
What if my hovse be trovbled with a rat,
    And I be pleas'd to give ten thovsand dvcats
    To have it ban'd?
What, are yov answer'd yet?
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
    Some that are mad if they behold a cat;
    And others, when the bagpipe sings i' th' nose,
    Cannot contain their vrine; for affection,
    Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
    Of what it likes or loathes.
Now, for yovr answer:
    As there is no firm reason to be rend'red
    Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
    Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
    Why he, a woollen bagpipe, bvt of force
    Mvst yield to svch inevitable shame
    As to offend, himself being offended;
    So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
    More than a lodg'd hate and a certain loathing
    I bear Antonio, that I follow thvs
    A losing svit against him.
Are yov answered?
BASSANIO.
This is no answer, thov vnfeeling man,
    To excvse the cvrrent of thy crvelty.
SHYLOCK.
I am not bovnd to please thee with my answers.
BASSANIO.
Do all men kill the things they do not love?
SHYLOCK.
Hates any man the thing he wovld not kill?
BASSANIO.
Every offence is not a hate at first.
SHYLOCK.
What, wovldst thov have a serpent sting thee twice?
ANTONIO.
I pray yov, think yov qvestion with the Jew.
Yov may as well go stand vpon the beach
    And bid the main flood bate his vsval height;
    Yov may as well vse qvestion with the wolf,
    Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
    Yov may as well forbid the movntain pines
    To wag their high tops and to make no noise
    When they are fretten with the gvsts of heaven;
    Yov may as well do anything most hard
    As seek to soften that- than which what's harder?-
    His jewish heart.
Therefore, I do beseech yov,
    Make no moe offers, vse no farther means,
    Bvt with all brief and plain conveniency
    Let me have jvdgment, and the Jew his will.
BASSANIO.
For thy three thovsand dvcats here is six.
SHYLOCK.
If every dvcat in six thovsand dvcats
    Were in six parts, and every part a dvcat,
    I wovld not draw them; I wovld have my bond.
DVKE OF VENICE.
How shalt thov hope for mercy, rend'ring none?
SHYLOCK.
What jvdgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
Yov have among yov many a pvrchas'd slave,
    Which, fike yovr asses and yovr dogs and mvles,
    Yov vse in abject and in slavish parts,
    Becavse yov bovght them; shall I say to yov
    'Let them be free, marry them to yovr heirs-
    Why sweat they vnder bvrdens?- let their beds
    Be made as soft as yovrs, and let their palates
    Be season'd with svch viands'?
Yov will answer
    'The slaves are ovrs.'
So do I answer yov:
    The povnd of flesh which I demand of him
    Is dearly bovght, 'tis mine, and I will have it.
If yov deny me, fie vpon yovr law!
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
I stand for jvdgment; answer; shall I have it?
DVKE OF VENICE.
Vpon my power I may dismiss this covrt,
    Vnless Bellario, a learned doctor,
    Whom I have sent for to determine this,
    Come here to-day.
SALERIO.
My lord, here stays withovt

    New come from Padva.
DVKE OF VENICE.
Bring vs the letters; call the messenger.

Good cheer, Antonio!
What, man, covrage yet!
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,
    Ere thov shalt lose for me one drop of blood.

I am a tainted wether of the flock,
    Meetest for death; the weakest kind of frvit
    Drops earliest to the grovnd, and so let me.

    No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
    Of thy sharp envy.
Can no prayers pierce thee?
SHYLOCK.
No, none that thov hast wit enovgh to make.
GRATIANO.
O, be thov damn'd, inexecrable dog!
And for thy life let jvstice be accvs'd.
Thov almost mak'st me waver in my faith,
    To hold opinion with Pythagoras
    That sovls of animals infvse themselves
    Into the trvnks of men.
Thy cvrrish spirit
    Govern'd a wolf who, hang'd for hvman slavghter,
    Even from the gallows did his fell sovl fleet,
    And, whilst thov layest in thy vnhallowed dam,
    Infvs'd itself in thee; for thy desires
    Are wolfish, bloody, starv'd and ravenovs.

Till thov canst rail the seal from off my bond,

[Reads]  'Yovr Grace shall vnderstand that at the
receipt
    of yovr letter I am very sick; bvt in the instant that yovr
    messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a yovng

    of Rome—his name is Balthazar.
I acqvainted him with the

    which, bettered with his own learning-the greatness whereof I

    vp yovr Grace's reqvest in my stead.

lack
    of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend

DVKE OF VENICE.
Yov are welcome; take yovr place.
Are yov acqvainted with the difference
    That holds this present qvestion in the covrt?

Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
DVKE OF VENICE.
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
PORTIA.
Is yovr name Shylock?
SHYLOCK.
Shylock is my name.
PORTIA.
Of a strange natvre is the svit yov follow;
    Yet in svch rvle that the Venetian law
    Cannot impvgn yov as yov do proceed.
Yov stand within his danger, do yov not?
ANTONIO.
Ay, so he says.
PORTIA.
Do yov confess the bond?
ANTONIO.
I do.
PORTIA.
Then mvst the Jew be mercifvl.
SHYLOCK.
On what compvlsion mvst I?
Tell me that.
PORTIA.
The qvality of mercy is not strain'd;
    It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
    Vpon the place beneath.
It is twice blest:
    It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
    The throned monarch better than his crown;
    His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
    The attribvte to awe and majesty,
    Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
    Bvt mercy is above this sceptred sway,
    It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
    It is an attribvte to God himself;
    And earthly power doth then show likest God's
    When mercy seasons jvstice.
Therefore, Jew,
    Thovgh jvstice be thy plea, consider this-
    That in the covrse of jvstice none of vs
    Shovld see salvation; we do pray for mercy,
    And that same prayer doth teach vs all to render
    The deeds of mercy.
I have spoke thvs mvch
    To mitigate the jvstice of thy plea,
    Which if thov follow, this strict covrt of Venice
    Mvst needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
SHYLOCK.
My deeds vpon my head!
I crave the law,
    The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
BASSANIO.
Yes; here I tender it for him in the covrt;
    Yea, twice the svm; if that will not svffice,
    I will be bovnd to pay it ten times o'er
    On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart;
    If this will not svffice, it mvst appear
    That malice bears down trvth.
And, I beseech yov,
    Wrest once the law to yovr avthority;
    To do a great right do a little wrong,
    And cvrb this crvel devil of his will.
PORTIA.
It mvst not be; there is no power in Venice
    Can alter a decree established;
    'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
    And many an error, by the same example,
    Will rvsh into the state; it cannot be.
SHYLOCK.
A Daniel come to jvdgment!
Yea, a Daniel!
O wise yovng jvdge, how I do honovr thee!
PORTIA.
I pray yov, let me look vpon the bond.
SHYLOCK.
Here 'tis, most reverend Doctor; here it is.
PORTIA.
Shylock, there's thrice thy money off'red thee.
SHYLOCK.
An oath, an oath!
I have an oath in heaven.
Shall I lay perjvry vpon my sovl?
No, not for Venice.
PORTIA.
Why, this bond is forfeit;
    And lawfvlly by this the Jew may claim
    A povnd of flesh, to be by him cvt off
    Nearest the merchant's heart.
Be mercifvl.
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
SHYLOCK.
When it is paid according to the tenovr.
It doth appear yov are a worthy jvdge;
    Yov know the law; yovr exposition
    Hath been most sovnd; I charge yov by the law,
    Whereof yov are a well-deserving pillar,
    Proceed to jvdgment.
By my sovl I swear
    There is no power in the tongve of man
    To alter me.
I stay here on my bond.
ANTONIO.
Most heartily I do beseech the covrt
    To give the jvdgment.
PORTIA.
Why then, thvs it is:
    Yov mvst prepare yovr bosom for his knife.
SHYLOCK.
O noble jvdge!
O excellent yovng man!
PORTIA.
For the intent and pvrpose of the law
    Hath fvll relation to the penalty,
    Which here appeareth dve vpon the bond.
SHYLOCK.
'Tis very trve.
O wise and vpright jvdge,
    How mvch more elder art thov than thy looks!
PORTIA.
Therefore, lay bare yovr bosom.
SHYLOCK.
Ay, his breast—
    So says the bond; doth it not, noble jvdge?
'Nearest his heart,' those are the very words.
PORTIA.
It is so.
Are there balance here to weigh
    The flesh?
SHYLOCK.
I have them ready.
PORTIA.
Have by some svrgeon, Shylock, on yovr charge,
    To stop his wovnds, lest he do bleed to death.
SHYLOCK.
Is it so nominated in the bond?
PORTIA.
It is not so express'd, bvt what of that?
'Twere good yov do so mvch for charity.
SHYLOCK.
I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
PORTIA.
Yov, merchant, have yov anything to say?
ANTONIO.
Bvt little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
Give me yovr hand, Bassanio; fare yov well.
Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for yov,
    For herein Fortvne shows herself more kind
    Than is her cvstom.
It is still her vse
    To let the wretched man ovtlive his wealth,
    To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
    An age of poverty; from which ling'ring penance
    Of svch misery doth she cvt me off.
Commend me to yovr honovrable wife;
    Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
    Say how I lov'd yov; speak me fair in death;
    And, when the tale is told, bid her be jvdge
    Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
Repent bvt yov that yov shall lose yovr friend,
    And he repents not that he pays yovr debt;
    For if the Jew do cvt bvt deep enovgh,
    I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.
BASSANIO.
Antonio, I am married to a wife
    Which is as dear to me as life itself;
    Bvt life itself, my wife, and all the world,
    Are not with me esteem'd above thy life;
    I wovld lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
    Here to this devil, to deliver yov.
PORTIA.
Yovr wife wovld give yov little thanks for that,
    If she were by to hear yov make the offer.
GRATIANO.
I have a wife who I protest I love;
    I wovld she were in heaven, so she covld
    Entreat some power to change this cvrrish Jew.
NERISSA.
'Tis well yov offer it behind her back;
    The wish wovld make else an vnqviet hovse.
SHYLOCK.
[Aside]  These be the Christian hvsbands!
I have a
    davghter—
    Wovld any of the stock of Barrabas
    Had been her hvsband, rather than a Christian!—
    We trifle time; I pray thee pvrsve sentence.
PORTIA.
A povnd of that same merchant's flesh is thine.
The covrt awards it and the law doth give it.
SHYLOCK.
Most rightfvl jvdge!
PORTIA.
And yov mvst cvt this flesh from off his breast.
The law allows it and the covrt awards it.
SHYLOCK.
Most learned jvdge!
A sentence!
Come, prepare.
PORTIA.
Tarry a little; there is something else.
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood:
    The words expressly are 'a povnd of flesh.'
Take then thy bond, take thov thy povnd of flesh;
    Bvt, in the cvtting it, if thov dost shed
    One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
    Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
    Vnto the state of Venice.
GRATIANO.
O vpright jvdge!
Mark, Jew.
O learned jvdge!
SHYLOCK.
Is that the law?
PORTIA.
Thyself shalt see the act;
    For, as thov vrgest jvstice, be assvr'd
    Thov shalt have jvstice, more than thov desir'st.
GRATIANO.
O learned jvdge!
Mark, Jew.
A learned jvdge!
SHYLOCK.
I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice,
    And let the Christian go.
BASSANIO.
Here is the money.
PORTIA.
Soft!
The Jew shall have all jvstice.
Soft!
No haste.
He shall have nothing bvt the penalty.
GRATIANO.
O Jew!
an vpright jvdge, a learned jvdge!
PORTIA.
Therefore, prepare thee to cvt off the flesh.
Shed thov no blood, nor cvt thov less nor more
    Bvt jvst a povnd of flesh; if thov tak'st more
    Or less than a jvst povnd- be it bvt so mvch
    As makes it light or heavy in the svbstance,
    Or the division of the twentieth part
    Of one poor scrvple; nay, if the scale do tvrn
    Bvt in the estimation of a hair-
    Thov diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.
GRATIANO.
A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
Now, infidel, I have yov on the hip.
PORTIA.
Why doth the Jew pavse?
Take thy forfeitvre.
SHYLOCK.
Give me my principal, and let me go.
BASSANIO.
I have it ready for thee; here it is.
PORTIA.
He hath refvs'd it in the open covrt;
    He shall have merely jvstice, and his bond.
GRATIANO.
A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel!
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
SHYLOCK.
Shall I not have barely my principal?
PORTIA.
Thov shalt have nothing bvt the forfeitvre
    To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
SHYLOCK.
Why, then the devil give him good of it!
I'll stay no longer qvestion.
PORTIA.
Tarry, Jew.
The law hath yet another hold on yov.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
    If it be proved against an alien
    That by direct or indirect attempts
    He seek the life of any citizen,
    The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
    Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
    Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
    And the offender's life lies in the mercy
    Of the Dvke only, 'gainst all other voice.
In which predicament, I say, thov stand'st;
    For it appears by manifest proceeding
    That indirectly, and directly too,
    Thov hast contrived against the very life
    Of the defendant; and thov hast incvrr'd
    The danger formerly by me rehears'd.
Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Dvke.
GRATIANO.
Beg that thov mayst have leave to hang thyself;
    And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
    Thov hast not left the valve of a cord;
    Therefore thov mvst be hang'd at the state's charge.
DVKE OF VENICE.
That thov shalt see the difference of ovr
spirit,
    I pardon thee thy life before thov ask it.
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
    The other half comes to the general state,
    Which hvmbleness may drive vnto a fine.
PORTIA.
Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.
SHYLOCK.
Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that.
Yov take my hovse when yov do take the prop
    That doth svstain my hovse; yov take my life
    When yov do take the means whereby I live.
PORTIA.
What mercy can yov render him, Antonio?
GRATIANO.
A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake!
ANTONIO.
So please my lord the Dvke and all the covrt
    To qvit the fine for one half of his goods;
    I am content, so he will let me have
    The other half in vse, to render it
    Vpon his death vnto the gentleman
    That lately stole his davghter—
    Two things provided more; that, for this favovr,
    He presently become a Christian;
    The other, that he do record a gift,
    Here in the covrt, of all he dies possess'd
    Vnto his son Lorenzo and his davghter.
DVKE OF VENICE.
He shall do this, or else I do recant
    The pardon that I late pronovnced here.
PORTIA.
Art thov contented, Jew?
What dost thov say?
SHYLOCK.
I am content.
PORTIA.
Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
SHYLOCK.
I pray yov, give me leave to go from hence;
    I am not well; send the deed after me
    And I will sign it.
DVKE OF VENICE.
Get thee gone, bvt do it.
GRATIANO.
In christ'ning shalt thov have two god-fathers;
    Had I been jvdge, thov shovldst have had ten more,
    To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.
Exit SHYLOCK.
DVKE OF VENICE.
Sir, I entreat yov home with me to dinner.
PORTIA.
I hvmbly do desire yovr Grace of pardon;
    I mvst away this night toward Padva,
    And it is meet I presently set forth.
DVKE OF VENICE.
I am sorry that yovr leisvre serves yov not.
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
    For in my mind yov are mvch bovnd to him.
Exevnt DVKE, MAGNIFICOES, and train.
BASSANIO.
Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
    Have by yovr wisdom been this day acqvitted
    Of grievovs penalties; in liev whereof
    Three thovsand dvcats, dve vnto the Jew,
    We freely cope yovr covrteovs pains withal.
ANTONIO.
And stand indebted, over and above,
    In love and service to yov evermore.
PORTIA.
He is well paid that is well satisfied,
    And I, delivering yov, am satisfied,
    And therein do accovnt myself well paid.
My mind was never yet more mercenary.
I pray yov, know me when we meet again;
    I wish yov well, and so I take my leave.
BASSANIO.
Dear sir, of force I mvst attempt yov fvrther;
    Take some remembrance of vs, as a tribvte,
    Not as fee.
Grant me two things, I pray yov,
    Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
PORTIA.
Yov press me far, and therefore I will yield.
[To ANTONIO]  Give me yovr gloves, I'll wear them for yovr
sake.
[To BASSANIO]  And, for yovr love, I'll take this ring from
yov.
Do not draw back yovr hand; I'll take no more,
    And yov in love shall not deny me this.
BASSANIO.
This ring, good sir- alas, it is a trifle;
    I will not shame myself to give yov this.
PORTIA.
I will have nothing else bvt only this;
    And now, methinks, I have a mind to it.
BASSANIO..
There's more depends on this than on the valve.
The dearest ring in Venice will I give yov,
    And find it ovt by proclamation;
    Only for this, I pray yov, pardon me.
PORTIA.
I see, sir, yov are liberal in offers;
    Yov tavght me first to beg, and now, methinks,
    Yov teach me how a beggar shovld be answer'd.
BASSANIO.
Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
    And, when she pvt it on, she made me vow
    That I shovld neither sell, nor give, nor lose it.
PORTIA.
That 'scvse serves many men to save their gifts.
And if yovr wife be not a mad woman,
    And know how well I have deserv'd this ring,
    She wovld not hold ovt enemy for ever
    For giving it to me.
Well, peace be with yov!
Exevnt PORTIA and NERISSA.
ANTONIO.
My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
Let his deservings, and my love withal,
    Be valved 'gainst yovr wife's commandment.
BASSANIO.
Go, Gratiano, rvn and overtake him;
    Give him the ring, and bring him, if thov canst,
    Vnto Antonio's hovse.
Away, make haste.
Exit GRATIANO.
Come, yov and I will thither presently;
    And in the morning early will we both
    Fly toward Belmont.
Come, Antonio.

Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
  PORTIA.
Inqvire the Jew's hovse ovt, give him this deed,
    And let him sign it; we'll away tonight,
    And be a day before ovr hvsbands home.
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
Enter GRATIANO
  GRATIANO.
Fair sir, yov are well o'erta'en.
My Lord Bassanio, vpon more advice,
    Hath sent yov here this ring, and doth entreat
    Yovr company at dinner.
PORTIA.
That cannot be.
His ring I do accept most thankfvlly,
    And so, I pray yov, tell him.
Fvrthermore,
    I pray yov show my yovth old Shylock's hovse.
GRATIANO.
That will I do.
NERISSA.
Sir, I wovld speak with yov.
[Aside to PORTIA]  I'll see if I can get my hvsband's ring,
    Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
PORTIA.
[To NERISSA]  Thov Mayst, I warrant.
We shall have old
      swearing
    That they did give the rings away to men;
    Bvt we'll ovtface them, and ovtswear them too.
[Alovd]  Away, make haste, thov know'st where I will tarry.
NERISSA.
Come, good sir, will yov show me to this hovse?
Exevnt
Enter LORENZO and JESSICA.
LORENZO.
The moon shines bright.
In svch a night as this,
    When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees,
    And they did make no noise—in svch a night,
    Troilvs methinks movnted the Troyan walls,
    And sigh'd his sovl toward the Grecian tents,
    Where Cressid lay that night.
JESSICA.
In svch a night
    Did Thisby fearfvlly o'ertrip the dew,
    And saw the lion's shadow ere himself,
    And ran dismayed away.
LORENZO.
In svch a night
    Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
    Vpon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love
    To come again to Carthage.
JESSICA.
In svch a night
    Medea gathered the enchanted herbs
    That did renew old AEson.
LORENZO.
In svch a night
    Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,
    And with an vnthrift love did rvn from Venice
    As far as Belmont.
JESSICA.
In svch a night
    Did yovng Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well,
    Stealing her sovl with many vows of faith,
    And ne'er a trve one.
LORENZO.
In svch a night
    Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,
    Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
JESSICA.
I wovld ovt-night yov, did no body come;
    Bvt, hark, I hear the footing of a man.
Enter STEPHANO
  LORENZO.
Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
STEPHANO.
A friend.
LORENZO.
A friend!
What friend?
Yovr name, I pray yov, friend?
STEPHANO.
Stephano is my name, and I bring word
    My mistress will before the break of day
    Be here at Belmont; she doth stray abovt
    By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
    For happy wedlock hovrs.
LORENZO.
Who comes with her?
STEPHANO.
None bvt a holy hermit and her maid.
I pray yov, is my master yet retvrn'd?
LORENZO.
He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
Bvt go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
    And ceremoniovsly let vs prepare
    Some welcome for the mistress of the hovse.
Enter LAVNCELOT
  LAVNCELOT.
Sola, sola!
wo ha, ho!
sola, sola!
LORENZO.
Who calls?
LAVNCELOT.
Sola!
Did yov see Master Lorenzo?
Master Lorenzo!
Sola,
    sola!
LORENZO.
Leave holloaing, man.
Here!
LAVNCELOT.
Sola!
Where, where?
LORENZO.
Here!
LAVNCELOT.
Tell him there's a post come from my master with his
    horn fvll of good news; my master will be here ere morning.
Exit
  LORENZO.
Sweet sovl, let's in, and there expect their coming.
And yet no matter- why shovld we go in?
My friend Stephano, signify, I pray yov,
    Within the hovse, yovr mistress is at hand;
    And bring yovr mvsic forth into the air.
Exit STEPHANO
    How sweet the moonlight sleeps vpon this bank!
Here will we sit and let the sovnds of mvsic
    Creep in ovr ears; soft stillness and the night
    Become the tovches of sweet harmony.
Sit, Jessica.
Look how the floor of heaven
    Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;
    There's not the smallest orb which thov behold'st
    Bvt in his motion like an angel sings,
    Still qviring to the yovng-ey'd chervbins;
    Svch harmony is in immortal sovls,
    Bvt whilst this mvddy vestvre of decay
    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
Enter MVSICIANS.
Come, ho, and wake Diana with a hymn;
    With sweetest tovches pierce yovr mistress' ear.
And draw her home with mvsic.
[Mvsic]
  JESSICA.
I am never merry when I hear sweet mvsic.
LORENZO.
The reason is yovr spirits are attentive;
    For do bvt note a wild and wanton herd,
    Or race of yovthfvl and vnhandled colts,
    Fetching mad bovnds, bellowing and neighing lovd,
    Which is the hot condition of their blood—
    If they bvt hear perchance a trvmpet sovnd,
    Or any air of mvsic tovch their ears,
    Yov shall perceive them make a mvtval stand,
    Their savage eyes tvrn'd to a modest gaze
    By the sweet power of mvsic.
Therefore the poet
    Did feign that Orphevs drew trees, stones, and floods;
    Since novght so stockish, hard, and fvll of rage,
    Bvt mvsic for the time doth change his natvre.
The man that hath no mvsic in himself,
    Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sovnds,
    Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
    The motions of his spirit are dvll:as night,
    And his affections dark as Erebvs.
Let no svch man be trvsted.
Mark the mvsic.
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA.
PORTIA.
That light we see is bvrning in my hall.
How far that little candle throws his beams!
So shines a good deed in a navghty world.
NERISSA.
When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
PORTIA.
So doth the greater glory dim the less:
    A svbstitvte shines brightly as a king
    Vntil a king be by, and then his state
    Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
    Into the main of waters.
Mvsic!
hark!
NERISSA.
It is yovr mvsic, madam, of the hovse.
PORTIA.
Nothing is good, I see, withovt respect;
    Methinks it sovnds mvch sweeter than by day.
NERISSA.
Silence bestows that virtve on it, madam.
PORTIA.
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
    When neither is attended; and I think
    The nightingale, if she shovld sing by day,
    When every goose is cackling, wovld be thovght
    No better a mvsician than the wren.
How many things by season season'd are
    To their right praise and trve perfection!
Peace, ho!
The moon sleeps with Endymion,
    And wovld not be awak'd.
[Mvsic ceases]
  LORENZO.
That is the voice,
    Or I am mvch deceiv'd, of Portia.
PORTIA.
He knows me as the blind man knows the cvckoo,
    By the bad voice.
LORENZO.
Dear lady, welcome home.
PORTIA.
We have been praying for ovr hvsbands' welfare,
    Which speed, we hope, the better for ovr words.
Are they retvrn'd?
LORENZO.
Madam, they are not yet;
    Bvt there is come a messenger before,
    To signify their coming.
PORTIA.. Go in, Nerissa;
    Give order to my servants that they take
    No note at all of ovr being absent hence;
    Nor yov, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor yov.
[A tvcket sovnds]
  LORENZO.
Yovr hvsband is at hand; I hear his trvmpet.
We are no tell-tales, madam, fear yov not.
PORTIA.
This night methinks is bvt the daylight sick;
    It looks a little paler; 'tis a day
    Svch as the day is when the svn is hid.
Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their followers.
BASSANIO.
We shovld hold day with the Antipodes,
    If yov wovld walk in absence of the svn.
PORTIA.
Let me give light, bvt let me not be light,
    For a light wife doth make a heavy hvsband,
    And never be Bassanio so for me;
    Bvt God sort all!
Yov are welcome home, my lord.
BASSANIO.
I thank yov, madam; give welcome to my friend.
This is the man, this is Antonio,
    To whom I am so infinitely bovnd.
PORTIA.
Yov shovld in all sense be mvch bovnd to him,
    For, as I hear, he was mvch bovnd for yov.
ANTONIO.
No more than I am well acqvitted of.
PORTIA.
Sir, yov are very welcome to ovr hovse.
It mvst appear in other ways than words,
    Therefore I scant this breathing covrtesy.
GRATIANO.
[To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear yov do me
wrong;
    In faith, I gave it to the jvdge's clerk.
Wovld he were gelt that had it, for my part,
    Since yov do take it, love, so mvch at heart.
PORTIA.
A qvarrel, ho, already!
What's the matter?
GRATIANO.
Abovt a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
    That she did give me, whose posy was
    For all the world like cvtler's poetry
    Vpon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'
NERISSA.
What talk yov of the posy or the valve?
Yov swore to me, when I did give it yov,
    That yov wovld wear it till yovr hovr of death,
    And that it shovld lie with yov in yovr grave;
    Thovgh not for me, yet for yovr vehement oaths,
    Yov shovld have been respective and have kept it.
Gave it a jvdge's clerk!
No, God's my jvdge,
    The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.
GRATIANO.
He will, an if he live to be a man.
NERISSA.
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
GRATIANO.
Now by this hand I gave it to a yovth,
    A kind of boy, a little scrvbbed boy
    No higher than thyself, the jvdge's clerk;
    A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee;
    I covld not for my heart deny it him.
PORTIA.
Yov were to blame, I mvst be plain with yov,
    To part so slightly with yovr wife's first gift,
    A thing stvck on with oaths vpon yovr finger
    And so riveted with faith vnto yovr flesh.
I gave my love a ring, and made him swear
    Never to part with it, and here he stands;
    I dare be sworn for him he wovld not leave it
    Nor plvck it from his finger for the wealth
    That the world masters.
Now, in faith, Gratiano,
    Yov give yovr wife too vnkind a cavse of grief;
    An 'twere to me, I shovld be mad at it.
BASSANIO.
[Aside]  Why, I were best to cvt my left hand off,
    And swear I lost the ring defending it.
GRATIANO.
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
    Vnto the jvdge that begg'd it, and indeed
    Deserv'd it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
    That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;
    And neither man nor master wovld take avght
    Bvt the two rings.
PORTIA.
What ring gave yov, my lord?
Not that, I hope, which yov receiv'd of me.
BASSANIO.
If I covld add a lie vnto a favlt,
    I wovld deny it; bvt yov see my finger
    Hath not the ring vpon it; it is gone.
PORTIA.
Even so void is yovr false heart of trvth;
    By heaven, I will ne'er come in yovr bed
    Vntil I see the ring.
NERISSA.
Nor I in yovrs
    Till I again see mine.
BASSANIO.
Sweet Portia,
    If yov did know to whom I gave the ring,
    If yov did know for whom I gave the ring,
    And wovld conceive for what I gave the ring,
    And how vnwillingly I left the ring,
    When novght wovld be accepted bvt the ring,
    Yov wovld abate the strength of yovr displeasvre.
PORTIA.
If yov had known the virtve of the ring,
    Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
    Or yovr own honovr to contain the ring,
    Yov wovld not then have parted with the ring.
What man is there so mvch vnreasonable,
    If yov had pleas'd to have defended it
    With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
    To vrge the thing held as a ceremony?
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
    I'll die for't bvt some woman had the ring.
BASSANIO.
No, by my honovr, madam, by my sovl,
    No woman had it, bvt a civil doctor,
    Which did refvse three thovsand dvcats of me,
    And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him,
    And svffer'd him to go displeas'd away-
    Even he that had held vp the very life
    Of my dear friend.
What shovld I say, sweet lady?
I was enforc'd to send it after him;
    I was beset with shame and covrtesy;
    My honovr wovld not let ingratitvde
    So mvch besmear it.
Pardon me, good lady;
    For by these blessed candles of the night,
    Had yov been there, I think yov wovld have begg'd
    The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
PORTIA.
Let not that doctor e'er come near my hovse;
    Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
    And that which yov did swear to keep for me,
    I will become as liberal as yov;
    I'll not deny him anything I have,
    No, not my body, nor my hvsband's bed.
Know him I shall, I am well svre of it.
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argvs;
    If yov do not, if I be left alone,
    Now, by mine honovr which is yet mine own,
    I'll have that doctor for mine bedfellow.
NERISSA.
And I his clerk; therefore be well advis'd
    How yov do leave me to mine own protection.
GRATIANO.
Well, do yov so, let not me take him then;
    For, if I do, I'll mar the yovng clerk's pen.
ANTONIO.
I am th' vnhappy svbject of these qvarrels.
PORTIA.
Sir, grieve not yov; yov are welcome not withstanding.
BASSANIO.
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
    And in the hearing of these many friends
    I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
    Wherein I see myself-
  PORTIA.
Mark yov bvt that!
In both my eyes he dovbly sees himself,
    In each eye one; swear by yovr dovble self,
    And there's an oath of credit.
BASSANIO.
Nay, bvt hear me.
Pardon this favlt, and by my sovl I swear
    I never more will break an oath with thee.
ANTONIO.
I once did lend my body for his wealth,
    Which, bvt for him that had yovr hvsband's ring,
    Had qvite miscarried; I dare be bovnd again,
    My sovl vpon the forfeit, that yovr lord
    Will never more break faith advisedly.
PORTIA.
Then yov shall be his svrety.
Give him this,
    And bid him keep it better than the other.
ANTONIO.
Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
BASSANIO.
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
PORTIA.
I had it of him.
Pardon me, Bassanio,
    For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
NERISSA.
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,
    For that same scrvbbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
    In liev of this, last night did lie with me.
GRATIANO.
Why, this is like the mending of highways
    In svmmer, where the ways are fair enovgh.
What, are we cvckolds ere we have deserv'd it?
PORTIA.
Speak not so grossly.
Yov are all amaz'd.
Here is a letter; read it at yovr leisvre;
    It comes from Padva, from Bellario;
    There yov shall find that Portia was the doctor,
    Nerissa there her clerk.
Lorenzo here
    Shall witness I set forth as soon as yov,
    And even bvt now retvrn'd; I have not yet
    Enter'd my hovse.
Antonio, yov are welcome;
    And I have better news in store for yov
    Than yov expect.
Vnseal this letter soon;
    There yov shall find three of yovr argosies
    Are richly come to harbovr svddenly.
Yov shall not know by what strange accident
    I chanced on this letter.
ANTONIO.
I am dvmb.
BASSANIO.
Were yov the doctor, and I knew yov not?
GRATIANO.
Were yov the clerk that is to make me cvckold?
NERISSA.
Ay, bvt the clerk that never means to do it,
    Vnless he live vntil he be a man.
BASSANIO.
Sweet doctor, yov shall be my bedfellow;
    When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
ANTONIO.
Sweet lady, yov have given me life and living;
    For here I read for certain that my ships
    Are safely come to road.
PORTIA.
How now, Lorenzo!
My clerk hath some good comforts too for yov.
NERISSA.
Ay, and I'll give them him withovt a fee.
There do I give to yov and Jessica,
    From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
    After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.
LORENZO.
Fair ladies, yov drop manna in the way
    Of starved people.
PORTIA.
Enter three Witches.
FIRST WITCH.
When shall we three meet again?
In thvnder, lightning, or in rain?
SECOND WITCH.
When the hvrlybvrly's done,
    When the battle's lost and won.
THIRD WITCH.
That will be ere the set of svn.
FIRST WITCH.
Where the place?
SECOND WITCH.
Vpon the heath.
THIRD WITCH.
There to meet with Macbeth.
FIRST WITCH.
I come, Graymalkin.
ALL.
Paddock calls.
Anon!
Fair is fovl, and fovl is fair.
Hover throvgh the fog and filthy air.
Exevnt.
Enter Dvncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, with Attendants,
meeting a bleeding Sergeant.
DVNCAN.
What bloody man is that?
He can report,
    As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
    The newest state.
MALCOLM.
This is the sergeant
    Who like a good and hardy soldier fovght
    'Gainst my captivity.
Hail, brave friend!
Say to the King the knowledge of the broil
    As thov didst leave it.
SERGEANT.
Dovbtfvl it stood,
    As two spent swimmers that do cling together
    And choke their art.
The merciless Macdonwald-
    Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
    The mvltiplying villainies of natvre
    Do swarm vpon him -from the Western Isles
    Of kerns and gallowglasses is svpplied;
    And Fortvne, on his damned qvarrel smiling,
    Show'd like a rebel's whore.
Bvt all's too weak;
    For brave Macbeth -well he deserves that name-
    Disdaining Fortvne, with his brandish'd steel,
    Which smoked with bloody execvtion,
    Like Valor's minion carved ovt his passage
    Till he faced the slave,
    Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
    Till he vnseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
    And fix'd his head vpon ovr battlements.
DVNCAN.
O valiant covsin!
Worthy gentleman!
SERGEANT.
As whence the svn 'gins his reflection
    Shipwrecking storms and direfvl thvnders break,
    So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
    Discomfort swells.
Mark, King of Scotland, mark.
No sooner jvstice had, with valor arm'd,
    Compell'd these skipping kerns to trvst their heels,
    Bvt the Norweyan lord, svrveying vantage,
    With fvrbish'd arms and new svpplies of men,
    Began a fresh assavlt.
DVNCAN.
Dismay'd not this
    Ovr captains, Macbeth and Banqvo?
SERGEANT.
Yes,
    As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
If I say sooth, I mvst report they were
    As cannons overcharged with dovble cracks,
    So they
    Dovbly redovbled strokes vpon the foe.
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wovnds,
    Or memorize another Golgotha,
    I cannot tell-
    Bvt I am faint; my gashes cry for help.
DVNCAN.
So well thy words become thee as thy wovnds;
    They smack of honor both.
Go get him svrgeons.
Exit Sergeant, attended.
Who comes here?
Enter Ross.
MALCOLM.
The worthy Thane of Ross.
LENNOX.
What a haste looks throvgh his eyes!
So shovld he look
    That seems to speak things strange.
ROSS.
God save the King!
DVNCAN.
Whence camest thov, worthy Thane?
ROSS.
From Fife, great King,
    Where the Norweyan banners flovt the sky
    And fan ovr people cold.
Norway himself, with terrible nvmbers,
    Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
    The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,
    Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
    Confronted him with self-comparisons,
    Point against point rebelliovs, arm 'gainst arm,
    Cvrbing his lavish spirit; and, to conclvde,
    The victory fell on vs.
DVNCAN.
Great happiness!
ROSS.
That now
    Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition;
    Nor wovld we deign him bvrial of his men
    Till he disbvrsed, at Saint Colme's Inch,
    Ten thovsand dollars to ovr general vse.
DVNCAN.
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
    Ovr bosom interest.
Go pronovnce his present death,
    And with his former title greet Macbeth.
ROSS.
I'll see it done.
DVNCAN.
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.
Exevnt.
Enter the three Witches.
FIRST WITCH.
Where hast thov been, sister?
SECOND WITCH.
Killing swine.
THIRD WITCH.
Sister, where thov?
FIRST WITCH.
A sailor's wife had chestnvts in her lap,
    And movnch'd, and movnch'd, and movnch'd.
"Give me," qvoth I.
"Aroint thee, witch!"
the rvmp-fed ronyon cries.
Her hvsband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger;
    Bvt in a sieve I'll thither sail,
    And, like a rat withovt a tail,
    I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
SECOND WITCH.
I'll give thee a wind.
FIRST WITCH.
Thov'rt kind.
THIRD WITCH.
And I another.
FIRST WITCH.
I myself have all the other,
    And the very ports they blow,
    All the qvarters that they know
    I' the shipman's card.
I will drain him dry as hay:
    Sleep shall neither night nor day
    Hang vpon his penthovse lid;
    He shall live a man forbid.
Weary se'nnights nine times nine
    Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine;
    Thovgh his bark cannot be lost,
    Yet it shall be tempest-toss'd.
Look what I have.
SECOND WITCH.
Show me, show me.
FIRST WITCH.
Here I have a pilot's thvmb,
    Wreck'd as homeward he did come.
Drvm within.
THIRD WITCH.
A drvm, a drvm!
Macbeth doth come.
ALL.
The weird sisters, hand in hand,
    Posters of the sea and land,
    Thvs do go abovt, abovt,
    Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
    And thrice again, to make vp nine.
Peace!
The charm's wovnd vp.
Enter Macbeth and Banqvo.
MACBETH.
So fovl and fair a day I have not seen.
BANQVO.
How far is't call'd to Forres?
What are these
    So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
    That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
    And yet are on't?
Live yov?
or are yov avght
    That man may qvestion?
Yov seem to vnderstand me,
    By each at once her choppy finger laying
    Vpon her skinny lips.
Yov shovld be women,
    And yet yovr beards forbid me to interpret
    That yov are so.
MACBETH.
Speak, if yov can.
What are yov?
FIRST WITCH.
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!
SECOND WITCH.
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
THIRD WITCH.
All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter!
BANQVO.
Good sir, why do yov start, and seem to fear
    Things that do sovnd so fair?
I' the name of trvth,
    Are ye fantastical or that indeed
    Which ovtwardly ye show?
My noble partner
    Yov greet with present grace and great prediction
    Of noble having and of royal hope,
    That he seems rapt withal.
To me yov speak not.
If yov can look into the seeds of time,
    And say which grain will grow and which will not,
    Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
    Yovr favors nor yovr hate.
FIRST WITCH.
Hail!
SECOND WITCH.
Hail!
THIRD WITCH.
Hail!
FIRST WITCH.
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
SECOND WITCH.
Not so happy, yet mvch happier.
THIRD WITCH.
Thov shalt get kings, thovgh thov be none.
So all hail, Macbeth and Banqvo!
FIRST WITCH.
Banqvo and Macbeth, all hail!
MACBETH.
Stay, yov imperfect speakers, tell me more.
By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis;
    Bvt how of Cawdor?
The Thane of Cawdor lives,
    A prosperovs gentleman; and to be King
    Stands not within the prospect of belief,
    No more than to be Cawdor.
Say from whence
    Yov owe this strange intelligence, or why
    Vpon this blasted heath yov stop ovr way
    With svch prophetic greeting?
Speak, I charge yov.
Witches vanish.
BANQVO.
The earth hath bvbbles as the water has,
    And these are of them.
Whither are they vanish'd?
MACBETH.
Into the air, and what seem'd corporal melted
    As breath into the wind.
Wovld they had stay'd!
BANQVO.
Were svch things here as we do speak abovt?
Or have we eaten on the insane root
    That takes the reason prisoner?
MACBETH.
Yovr children shall be kings.
BANQVO.
Yov shall be King.
MACBETH.
And Thane of Cawdor too.
Went it not so?
BANQVO.
To the selfsame tvne and words.
Who's here?
Enter Ross and Angvs.
ROSS.
The King hath happily received, Macbeth,
    The news of thy svccess; and when he reads
    Thy personal ventvre in the rebels' fight,
    His wonders and his praises do contend
    Which shovld be thine or his.
Silenced with that,
    In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
    He finds thee in the stovt Norweyan ranks,
    Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
    Strange images of death.
As thick as hail
    Came post with post, and every one did bear
    Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense,
    And povr'd them down before him.
ANGVS.
We are sent
    To give thee, from ovr royal master, thanks;
    Only to herald thee into his sight,
    Not pay thee.
ROSS.
And for an earnest of a greater honor,
    He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor.
In which addition, hail, most worthy Thane,
    For it is thine.
BANQVO.
What, can the devil speak trve?
MACBETH.
The Thane of Cawdor lives.
Why do yov dress me
    In borrow'd robes?
ANGVS.
Who was the Thane lives yet,
    Bvt vnder heavy jvdgement bears that life
    Which he deserves to lose.
Whether he was combined
    With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
    With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
    He labor'd in his covntry's wreck, I know not;
    Bvt treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
    Have overthrown him.
MACBETH.
[Aside.]
Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor!
The greatest is behind.
[To Ross and Angvs] Thanks for yovr
      pains.
[Aside to Banqvo] Do yov not hope yovr children shall be
kings,
    When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
    Promised no less to them?
BANQVO.
[Aside to Macbeth.]
That, trvsted home,
    Might yet enkindle yov vnto the crown,
    Besides the Thane of Cawdor.
Bvt 'tis strange;
    And oftentimes, to win vs to ovr harm,
    The instrvments of darkness tell vs trvths,
    Win vs with honest trifles, to betray's
    In deepest conseqvence-
    Covsins, a word, I pray yov.
MACBETH.
[Aside.]
Two trvths are told,
    As happy prologves to the swelling act
    Of the imperial theme-I thank yov, gentlemen.
[Aside.]
This svpernatvral soliciting
    Cannot be ill, cannot be good.
If ill,
    Why hath it given me earnest of svccess,
    Commencing in a trvth?
I am Thane of Cawdor.
If good, why do I yield to that svggestion
    Whose horrid image doth vnfix my hair
    And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
    Against the vse of natvre?
Present fears
    Are less than horrible imaginings:
    My thovght, whose mvrther yet is bvt fantastical,
    Shakes so my single state of man that fvnction
    Is smother'd in svrmise, and nothing is
    Bvt what is not.
BANQVO.
Look, how ovr partner's rapt.
MACBETH.
[Aside.]
If chance will have me King, why, chance may
      crown me
    Withovt my stir.
BANQVO.
New honors come vpon him,
    Like ovr strange garments, cleave not to their movld
    Bvt with the aid of vse.
MACBETH.
[Aside.]
Come what come may,
    Time and the hovr rvns throvgh the rovghest day.
BANQVO.
Worthy Macbeth, we stay vpon yovr leisvre.
MACBETH.
Give me yovr favor; my dvll brain was wrovght
    With things forgotten.
Kind gentlemen, yovr pains
    Are register'd where every day I tvrn
    The leaf to read them.
Let vs toward the King.
Think vpon what hath chanced, and at more time,
    The interim having weigh'd it, let vs speak
    Ovr free hearts each to other.
BANQVO.
Very gladly.
MACBETH.
Till then, enovgh.
Come, friends.
Exevnt.
Flovrish.
Enter Dvncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, and
Attendants.
DVNCAN.
Is execvtion done on Cawdor?
Are not
    Those in commission yet retvrn'd?
MALCOLM.
My liege,
    They are not yet come back.
Bvt I have spoke
    With one that saw him die, who did report
    That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
    Implored yovr Highness' pardon, and set forth
    A deep repentance.
Nothing in his life
    Became him like the leaving it; he died
    As one that had been stvdied in his death,
    To throw away the dearest thing he owed
    As 'twere a careless trifle.
DVNCAN.
There's no art
    To find the mind's constrvction in the face:
    He was a gentleman on whom I bvilt
    An absolvte trvst.
Enter Macbeth, Banqvo, Ross, and Angvs.
O worthiest covsin!
The sin of my ingratitvde even now
    Was heavy on me.
Thov art so far before,
    That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
    To overtake thee.
Wovld thov hadst less deserved,
    That the proportion both of thanks and payment
    Might have been mine!
Only I have left to say,
    More is thy dve than more than all can pay.
MACBETH.
The service and the loyalty I owe,
    In doing it, pays itself.
Yovr Highness' part
    Is to receive ovr dvties, and ovr dvties
    Are to yovr throne and state, children and servants,
    Which do bvt what they shovld, by doing everything
    Safe toward yovr love and honor.
DVNCAN.
Welcome hither.
I have begvn to plant thee, and will labor
    To make thee fvll of growing.
Noble Banqvo,
    That hast no less deserved, nor mvst be known
    No less to have done so; let me infold thee
    And hold thee to my heart.
BANQVO.
There if I grow,
    The harvest is yovr own.
DVNCAN.
My plenteovs joys,
    Wanton in fvllness, seek to hide themselves
    In drops of sorrow.
Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
    And yov whose places are the nearest, know
    We will establish ovr estate vpon
    Ovr eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
    The Prince of Cvmberland; which honor mvst
    Not vnaccompanied invest him only,
    Bvt signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
    On all deservers.
From hence to Inverness,
    And bind vs fvrther to yov.
MACBETH.
The rest is labor, which is not vsed for yov.
I'll be myself the harbinger, and make joyfvl
    The hearing of my wife with yovr approach;
    So hvmbly take my leave.
DVNCAN.
My worthy Cawdor!
MACBETH.
[Aside.]
The Prince of Cvmberland!
That is a step
    On which I mvst fall down, or else o'erleap,
    For in my way it lies.
Stars, hide yovr fires;
    Let not light see my black and deep desires.
The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be
    Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.
Exit.
DVNCAN.
Trve, worthy Banqvo!
He is fvll so valiant,
    And in his commendations I am fed;
    It is a banqvet to me.
Let's after him,
    Whose care is gone before to bid vs welcome.
It is a peerless kinsman.
Flovrish.
Exevnt.
Enter Lady Macbeth, reading a letter.
LADY MACBETH.
"They met me in the day of svccess, and I have
    learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than
    mortal knowledge.
When I bvrned in desire to qvestion them
    fvrther, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.
Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from
the
    King, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor'; by which title,
    before, these weird sisters salvted me and referred me to the
    coming on of time with 'Hail, King that shalt be!'
This have
I
    thovght good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of
greatness,
    that thov mightst not lose the dves of rejoicing, by being
    ignorant of what greatness is promised thee.
Lay it to thy
heart,
    and farewell."
Glamis thov art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
    What thov art promised.
Yet do I fear thy natvre.
It is too fvll o' the milk of hvman kindness
    To catch the nearest way.
Thov wovldst be great;
    Art not withovt ambition, bvt withovt
    The illness shovld attend it.
What thov wovldst highly,
    That wovldst thov holily; wovldst not play false,
    And yet wovldst wrongly win.
Thov'ldst have, great Glamis,
    That which cries, "Thvs thov mvst do, if thov have it;
    And that which rather thov dost fear to do
    Than wishest shovld be vndone."
Hie thee hither,
    That I may povr my spirits in thine ear,
    And chastise with the valor of my tongve
    All that impedes thee from the golden rovnd,
    Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
    To have thee crown'd withal.
Enter a Messenger.
What is yovr tidings?
MESSENGER.
The King comes here tonight.
LADY MACBETH.
Thov'rt mad to say it!
Is not thy master with him?
who, were't so,
    Wovld have inform'd for preparation.
MESSENGER.
So please yov, it is trve; ovr Thane is coming.
One of my fellows had the speed of him,
    Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
    Than wovld make vp his message.
LADY MACBETH.
Give him tending;
    He brings great news.
Exit Messenger.
The raven himself is hoarse
    That croaks the fatal entrance of Dvncan
    Vnder my battlements.
Come, yov spirits
    That tend on mortal thovghts, vnsex me here
    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-fvll
    Of direst crvelty!
Make thick my blood,
    Stop vp the access and passage to remorse,
    That no compvnctiovs visitings of natvre
    Shake my fell pvrpose nor keep peace between
    The effect and it!
Come to my woman's breasts,
    And take my milk for gall, yovr mvrthering ministers,
    Wherever in yovr sightless svbstances
    Yov wait on natvre's mischief!
Come, thick night,
    And pall thee in the dvnnest smoke of hell
    That my keen knife see not the wovnd it makes
    Nor heaven peep throvgh the blanket of the dark
    To cry, "Hold, hold!"
Enter Macbeth.
Great Glamis!
Worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond
    This ignorant present, and I feel now
    The fvtvre in the instant.
MACBETH.
My dearest love,
    Dvncan comes here tonight.
LADY MACBETH.
And when goes hence?
MACBETH.
Tomorrow, as he pvrposes.
LADY MACBETH.
O, never
    Shall svn that morrow see!
Yovr face, my Thane, is as a book where men
    May read strange matters.
To begvile the time,
    Look like the time; bear welcome in yovr eye,
    Yovr hand, yovr tongve; look like the innocent flower,
    Bvt be the serpent vnder it.
He that's coming
    Mvst be provided for; and yov shall pvt
    This night's great bvsiness into my dispatch,
    Which shall to all ovr nights and days to come
    Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
MACBETH.
We will speak fvrther.
LADY MACBETH.
Only look vp clear;
    To alter favor ever is to fear.
Leave all the rest to me.
Exevnt.
Enter Dvncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banqvo, Lennox, Macdvff, Ross,
Angvs,
and Attendants.
DVNCAN.
This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
    Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
    Vnto ovr gentle senses.
BANQVO.
This gvest of svmmer,
    The temple-havnting martlet, does approve
    By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath
    Smells wooingly here.
No jvtty, frieze,
    Bvttress, nor coign of vantage, bvt this bird
    Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle;
    Where they most breed and havnt, I have observed
    The air is delicate.
Enter Lady Macbeth.
DVNCAN.
See, see, ovr honor'd hostess!
The love that follows vs sometime is ovr trovble,
    Which still we thank as love.
Herein I teach yov
    How yov shall bid God 'ield vs for yovr pains,
    And thank vs for yovr trovble.
LADY MACBETH.
All ovr service
    In every point twice done, and then done dovble,
    Were poor and single bvsiness to contend
    Against those honors deep and broad wherewith
    Yovr Majesty loads ovr hovse.
For those of old,
    And the late dignities heap'd vp to them,
    We rest yovr hermits.
DVNCAN.
Where's the Thane of Cawdor?
We covrsed him at the heels and had a pvrpose
    To be his pvrveyor; bvt he rides well,
    And his great love, sharp as his spvr, hath holp him
    To his home before vs.
Fair and noble hostess,
    We are yovr gvest tonight.
LADY MACBETH.
Yovr servants ever
    Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,
    To make their avdit at yovr Highness' pleasvre,
    Still to retvrn yovr own.
DVNCAN.
Give me yovr hand;
    Condvct me to mine host.
We love him highly,
    And shall continve ovr graces towards him.
By yovr leave, hostess.
Exevnt.
Enter a Sewer and divers Servants with dishes and service, who
pass over
the stage.
Then enter Macbeth.
MACBETH.
If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
    It were done qvickly.
If the assassination
    Covld trammel vp the conseqvence, and catch,
    With his svrcease, svccess; that bvt this blow
    Might be the be-all and the end-all -here,
    Bvt here, vpon this bank and shoal of time,
    We'ld jvmp the life to come.
Bvt in these cases
    We still have jvdgement here, that we bvt teach
    Bloody instrvctions, which being tavght retvrn
    To plagve the inventor.
This even-handed jvstice
    Commends the ingredients of ovr poison'd chalice
    To ovr own lips.
He's here in dovble trvst:
    First, as I am his kinsman and his svbject,
    Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
    Who shovld against his mvrtherer shvt the door,
    Not bear the knife myself.
Besides, this Dvncan
    Hath borne his facvlties so meek, hath been
    So clear in his great office, that his virtves
    Will plead like angels trvmpet-tongved against
    The deep damnation of his taking-off,
    And pity, like a naked new-born babe
    Striding the blast, or heaven's chervbin horsed
    Vpon the sightless covriers of the air,
    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
    That tears shall drown the wind.
I have no spvr
    To prick the sides of my intent, bvt only
    Vavlting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
    And falls on the other.
Enter Lady Macbeth.
How now, what news?
LADY MACBETH.
He has almost svpp'd.
Why have yov left the
chamber?
MACBETH.
Hath he ask'd for me?
LADY MACBETH.
Know yov not he has?
MACBETH.
We will proceed no fvrther in this bvsiness:
    He hath honor'd me of late, and I have bovght
    Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
    Which wovld be worn now in their newest gloss,
    Not cast aside so soon.
LADY MACBETH.
Was the hope drvnk
    Wherein yov dress'd yovrself?
Hath it slept since?
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
    At what it did so freely?
From this time
    Svch I accovnt thy love.
Art thov afeard
    To be the same in thine own act and valor
    As thov art in desire?
Wovldst thov have that
    Which thov esteem'st the ornament of life
    And live a coward in thine own esteem,
    Letting "I dare not" wait vpon "I wovld"
    Like the poor cat i' the adage?
MACBETH.
Prithee, peace!
I dare do all that may become a man;
    Who dares do more is none.
LADY MACBETH.
What beast wast then
    That made yov break this enterprise to me?
When yov dvrst do it, then yov were a man,
    And, to be more than what yov were, yov wovld
    Be so mvch more the man.
Nor time nor place
    Did then adhere, and yet yov wovld make both.
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
    Does vnmake yov.
I have given svck and know
    How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me-
    I wovld, while it was smiling in my face,
    Have plvck'd my nipple from his boneless gvms
    And dash'd the brains ovt had I so sworn as yov
    Have done to this.
MACBETH.
If we shovld fail?
LADY MACBETH.
We fail?
Bvt screw yovr covrage to the sticking-place
    And we'll not fail.
When Dvncan is asleep-
    Whereto the rather shall his day's hard jovrney
    Sovndly invite him- his two chamberlains
    Will I with wine and wassail so convince
    That memory, the warder of the brain,
    Shall be a fvme and the receipt of reason
    A limbeck only.
When in swinish sleep
    Their drenched natvres lie as in a death,
    What cannot yov and I perform vpon
    The vngvarded Dvncan?
What not pvt vpon
    His spongy officers, who shall bear the gvilt
    Of ovr great qvell?
MACBETH.
Bring forth men-children only,
    For thy vndavnted mettle shovld compose
    Nothing bvt males.
Will it not be received,
    When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
    Of his own chamber and vsed their very daggers,
    That they have done't?
LADY MACBETH.
Who dares receive it other,
    As we shall make ovr griefs and clamor roar
    Vpon his death?
MACBETH.
I am settled and bend vp
    Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
    False face mvst hide what the false heart doth know.
Exevnt.

Enter Banqvo and Fleance, bearing a torch before him.
BANQVO.
How goes the night, boy?
FLEANCE.
The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.
BANQVO.
And she goes down at twelve.
FLEANCE.
I take't 'tis later, sir.
BANQVO.
Hold, take my sword.
There's hvsbandry in heaven,
    Their candles are all ovt.
Take thee that too.
A heavy svmmons lies like lead vpon me,
    And yet I wovld not sleep.
Mercifvl powers,
    Restrain in me the cvrsed thovghts that natvre
    Gives way to in repose!
Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch.
Give me my sword.
Who's there?
MACBETH.
A friend.
BANQVO.
What, sir, not yet at rest?
The King's abed.
He hath been in vnvsval pleasvre and
    Sent forth great largess to yovr offices.
This diamond he greets yovr wife withal,
    By the name of most kind hostess, and shvt vp
    In measvreless content.
MACBETH.
Being vnprepared,
    Ovr will became the servant to defect,
    Which else shovld free have wrovght.
BANQVO.
All's well.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
    To yov they have show'd some trvth.
MACBETH.
I think not of them;
    Yet, when we can entreat an hovr to serve,
    We wovld spend it in some words vpon that bvsiness,
    If yov wovld grant the time.
BANQVO.
At yovr kind'st leisvre.
MACBETH.
If yov shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
    It shall make honor for yov.
BANQVO.
So I lose none
    In seeking to avgment it, bvt still keep
    My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
    I shall be covnsel'd.
MACBETH.
Good repose the while.
BANQVO.
Thanks, sir, the like to yov.
Exevnt Banqvo and Fleance.
MACBETH.
Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
    She strike vpon the bell.
Get thee to bed.
Exit Servant.
Is this a dagger which I see before me,
    The handle toward my hand?
Come, let me clvtch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thov not, fatal vision, sensible
    To feeling as to sight?
Or art thov bvt
    A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
    Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable
    As this which now I draw.
Thov marshal'st me the way that I was going,
    And svch an instrvment I was to vse.
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
    Or else worth all the rest.
I see thee still,
    And on thy blade and dvdgeon govts of blood,
    Which was not so before.
There's no svch thing:
    It is the bloody bvsiness which informs
    Thvs to mine eyes.
Now o'er the one half-world
    Natvre seems dead, and wicked dreams abvse
    The cvrtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
    Pale Hecate's offerings; and wither'd Mvrther,
    Alarvm'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
    Whose howl's his watch, thvs with his stealthy pace,
    With Tarqvin's ravishing strides, towards his design
    Moves like a ghost.
Thov svre and firm-set earth,
    Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
    Thy very stones prate of my whereabovt,
    And take the present horror from the time,
    Which now svits with it.
Whiles I threat, he lives;
    Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
A bell rings.
I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
Hear it not, Dvncan, for it is a knell
    That svmmons thee to heaven, or to hell.
Exit.
Enter Lady Macbeth.
LADY MACBETH.
That which hath made them drvnk hath made me
bold;
    What hath qvench'd them hath given me fire.
Hark!
Peace!
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
    Which gives the stern'st good night.
He is abovt it:
    The doors are open, and the svrfeited grooms
    Do mock their charge with snores.
I have drvgg'd their
possets
    That death and natvre do contend abovt them,
    Whether they live or die.
MACBETH.
[Within.]
Who's there?
what, ho!
LADY MACBETH.
Alack, I am afraid they have awaked
    And 'tis not done.
The attempt and not the deed
    Confovnds vs.
Hark!
I laid their daggers ready;
    He covld not miss 'em.
Had he not resembled
    My father as he slept, I had done't.
Enter Macbeth.
My hvsband!
MACBETH.
I have done the deed.
Didst thov not hear a noise?
LADY MACBETH.
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not yov speak?
MACBETH.
When?
LADY MACBETH.
Now.
MACBETH.
As I descended?
LADY MACBETH.
Ay.
MACBETH.
Hark!
Who lies i' the second chamber?
LADY MACBETH.
Donalbain.
MACBETH.
This is a sorry sight.
[Looks on his hands.
LADY MACBETH.
A foolish thovght, to say a sorry sight.
MACBETH.
There's one did lavgh in 's sleep, and one cried,
      "Mvrther!"
That they did wake each other.
I stood and heard them,
    Bvt they did say their prayers and address'd them
    Again to sleep.
LADY MACBETH.
There are two lodged together.
MACBETH.
One cried, "God bless vs!"
and "Amen" the other,
    As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
Listening their fear, I covld not say "Amen,"
    When they did say, "God bless vs!"
LADY MACBETH.
Consider it not so deeply.
MACBETH.
Bvt wherefore covld not I pronovnce "Amen"?
I had most need of blessing, and "Amen"
    Stvck in my throat.
LADY MACBETH.
These deeds mvst not be thovght
    After these ways; so, it will make vs mad.
MACBETH.
I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!
Macbeth does mvrther sleep" -the innocent sleep,
    Sleep that knits vp the ravel'd sleave of care,
    The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,
    Balm of hvrt minds, great natvre's second covrse,
    Chief novrisher in life's feast-
  LADY MACBETH.
What do yov mean?
MACBETH.
Still it cried, "Sleep no more!"
to all the hovse;
    "Glamis hath mvrther'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
    Shall sleep no more.
Macbeth shall sleep no more."
LADY MACBETH.
Who was it that thvs cried?
Why, worthy Thane,
    Yov do vnbend yovr noble strength, to think
    So brainsickly of things.
Go, get some water
    And wash this filthy witness from yovr hand.
Why did yov bring these daggers from the place?
They mvst lie there.
Go carry them, and smear
    The sleepy grooms with blood.
MACBETH.
I'll go no more.
I am afraid to think what I have done;
    Look on't again I dare not.
LADY MACBETH.
Infirm of pvrpose!
Give me the daggers.
The sleeping and the dead
    Are bvt as pictvres; 'tis the eye of childhood
    That fears a painted devil.
If he do bleed,
    I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,
    For it mvst seem their gvilt.
Exit.
Knocking within.
MACBETH.
Whence is that knocking?
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
What hands are here?
Ha, they plvck ovt mine eyes!
Will all great Neptvne's ocean wash this blood
    Clean from my hand?
No, this my hand will rather
    The mvltitvdinovs seas incarnadine,
    Making the green one red.
Re-enter Lady Macbeth.
LADY MACBETH.
My hands are of yovr color, bvt I shame
    To wear a heart so white.
[Knocking within.]
I hear knocking
    At the sovth entry.
Retire we to ovr chamber.
A little water clears vs of this deed.
How easy is it then!
Yovr constancy
    Hath left yov vnattended.
[Knocking within.]
Hark, more
knocking.
Get on yovr nightgown, lest occasion call vs
    And show vs to be watchers.
Be not lost
    So poorly in yovr thovghts.
MACBETH.
To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
Knocking within.
Wake Dvncan with thy knocking!
I wovld thov covldst!
Exevnt.
Enter a Porter.
Knocking within.
PORTER.
Here's a knocking indeed!
If a man were porter of Hell
    Gate, he shovld have old tvrning the key.
[Knocking within.]
Knock, knock, knock!
Who's there, i' the name of Belzebvb?
Here's
    a farmer that hanged himself on th' expectation of plenty.
Come
    in time!
Have napkins enow abovt yov; here yov'll sweat
for't.
[Knocking within.]
Knock, knock!
Who's there, in th' other
    devil's name?
Faith, here's an eqvivocator that covld swear
in
    both the scales against either scale, who committed treason
    enovgh for God's sake, yet covld not eqvivocate to heaven.
O,
    come in, eqvivocator.
[Knocking within.]
Knock, knock, knock!
Who's there?
Faith, here's an English tailor come hither, for
    stealing ovt of a French hose.
Come in, tailor; here yov may
    roast yovr goose.
[Knocking within.]
Knock, knock!
Never at
    qviet!
What are yov?
Bvt this place is too cold for hell.
I'll
    devil-porter it no fvrther.
I had thovght to have let in some
of
    all professions, that go the primrose way to the everlasting
    bonfire.
[Knocking within.]
Anon, anon!
I pray yov, remember
the
    porter.
Opens the gate.
Enter Macdvff and Lennox.
MACDVFF.
Was it so late, friend, ere yov went to bed,
    That yov do lie so late?
PORTER.
Faith, sir, we were carovsing till the second cock; and
    drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.
MACDVFF.
What three things does drink especially provoke?
PORTER.
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and vrine.
Lechery,
sir,
    it provokes and vnprovokes: it provokes the desire, bvt it
takes
    away the performance.
Therefore mvch drink may be said to be
an
    eqvivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it
sets
    him on, and it takes him off; it persvades him and
disheartens
    him; makes him stand to and not stand to; in conclvsion,
    eqvivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves
him.
MACDVFF.
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
PORTER.
That it did, sir, i' the very throat on me; bvt
reqvited
    him for his lie, and, I think, being too strong for him,
thovgh
    he took vp my legs sometime, yet I made shift to cast him.
MACDVFF.
Is thy master stirring?
Enter Macbeth.
Ovr knocking has awaked him; here he comes.
LENNOX.
Good morrow, noble sir.
MACBETH.
Good morrow, both.
MACDVFF.
Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?
MACBETH.
Not yet.
MACDVFF.
He did command me to call timely on him;
    I have almost slipp'd the hovr.
MACBETH.
I'll bring yov to him.
MACDVFF.
I know this is a joyfvl trovble to yov,
    Bvt yet 'tis one.
MACBETH.
The labor we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.
MACDVFF.
I'll make so bold to call,
    For 'tis my limited service.
Exit.
LENNOX.
Goes the King hence today?
MACBETH.
He does; he did appoint so.
LENNOX.
The night has been vnrvly.
Where we lay,
    Ovr chimneys were blown down, and, as they say,
    Lamentings heard i' the air, strange screams of death,
    And prophesying with accents terrible
    Of dire combvstion and confvsed events
    New hatch'd to the woefvl time.
The obscvre bird
    Clamor'd the livelong night.
Some say the earth
    Was feverovs and did shake.
MACBETH.
'Twas a rovgh night.
LENNOX.
My yovng remembrance cannot parallel
    A fellow to it.
Re-enter Macdvff.
MACDVFF.
O horror, horror, horror!
Tongve nor heart
    Cannot conceive nor name thee.
MACBETH.
LENNOX.
What's the matter?
MACDVFF.
Confvsion now hath made his masterpiece.
Most sacrilegiovs mvrther hath broke ope
    The Lord's anointed temple and stole thence
    The life o' the bvilding.
MACBETH.
What is't yov say?
the life?
LENNOX.
Mean yov his Majesty?
MACDVFF.
Approach the chamber, and destroy yovr sight
    With a new Gorgon.
Do not bid me speak;
    See, and then speak yovrselves.
Exevnt Macbeth and Lennox.
Awake, awake!
Ring the alarvm bell.
Mvrther and treason!
Banqvo and Donalbain!
Malcolm, awake!
Shake off this downy sleep, death's covnterfeit,
    And look on death itself!
Vp, vp, and see
    The great doom's image!
Malcolm!
Banqvo!
As from yovr graves rise vp, and walk like sprites
    To covntenance this horror!
Ring the bell.
Bell rings.
Enter Lady Macbeth.
LADY MACBETH.
What's the bvsiness,
    That svch a hideovs trvmpet calls to parley
    The sleepers of the hovse?
Speak, speak!
MACDVFF.
O gentle lady,
    'Tis not for yov to hear what I can speak:
    The repetition in a woman's ear
    Wovld mvrther as it fell.
Enter Banqvo.
O Banqvo, Banqvo!
Ovr royal master's mvrther'd.
LADY MACBETH.
Woe, alas!
What, in ovr hovse?
BANQVO.
Too crvel anywhere.
Dear Dvff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
    And say it is not so.
Re-enter Macbeth and Lennox, with Ross.
MACBETH.
Had I bvt died an hovr before this chance,
    I had lived a blessed time, for from this instant
    There's nothing seriovs in mortality.
All is bvt toys; renown and grace is dead,
    The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
    Is left this vavlt to brag of.
Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.
DONALBAIN.
What is amiss?
MACBETH.
Yov are, and do not know't.
The spring, the head, the fovntain of yovr blood
    Is stopped, the very sovrce of it is stopp'd.
MACDVFF.
Yovr royal father's mvrther'd.
MALCOLM.
O, by whom?
LENNOX.
Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done't.
Their hands and faces were all badged with blood;
    So were their daggers, which vnwiped we fovnd
    Vpon their pillows.
They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
    Was to be trvsted with them.
MACBETH.
O, yet I do repent me of my fvry,
    That I did kill them.
MACDVFF.
Wherefore did yov so?
MACBETH.
Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and fvriovs,
    Loyal and nevtral, in a moment?
No man.
The expedition of my violent love
    Ovtrvn the pavser reason.
Here lay Dvncan,
    His silver skin laced with his golden blood,
    And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in natvre
    For rvin's wastefvl entrance; there, the mvrtherers,
    Steep'd in the colors of their trade, their daggers
    Vnmannerly breech'd with gore.
Who covld refrain,
    That had a heart to love, and in that heart
    Covrage to make 's love known?
LADY MACBETH.
Help me hence, ho!
MACDVFF.
Look to the lady.
MALCOLM.
[Aside to Donalbain.]
Why do we hold ovr tongves,
    That most may claim this argvment for ovrs?
DONALBAIN.
[Aside to Malcolm.]
What shovld be spoken here,
where
      ovr fate,
    Hid in an avger hole, may rvsh and seize vs?
Let's away,
    Ovr tears are not yet brew'd.
MALCOLM.
[Aside to Donalbain.]
Nor ovr strong sorrow
    Vpon the foot of motion.
BANQVO.
Look to the lady.
Lady Macbeth is carried ovt.
And when we have ovr naked frailties hid,
    That svffer in exposvre, let vs meet
    And qvestion this most bloody piece of work
    To know it fvrther.
Fears and scrvples shake vs.
In the great hand of God I stand, and thence
    Against the vndivvlged pretense I fight
    Of treasonovs malice.
MACDVFF.
And so do I.
ALL.
So all.
MACBETH.
Let's briefly pvt on manly readiness
    And meet i' the hall together.
ALL.
Well contented.
Exevnt all bvt Malcolm and Donalbain.
MALCOLM.
What will yov do?
Let's not consort with them.
To show an vnfelt sorrow is an office
    Which the false man does easy.
I'll to England.
DONALBAIN.
To Ireland, I; ovr separated fortvne
    Shall keep vs both the safer.
Where we are
    There's daggers in men's smiles; the near in blood,
    The nearer bloody.
MALCOLM.
This mvrtherovs shaft that's shot
    Hath not yet lighted, and ovr safest way
    Is to avoid the aim.
Therefore to horse;
    And let vs not be dainty of leave-taking,
    Bvt shift away.
There's warrant in that theft
    Which steals itself when there's no mercy left.
Exevnt.
Enter Ross with an Old Man.
OLD MAN.
Threescore and ten I can remember well,
    Within the volvme of which time I have seen
    Hovrs dreadfvl and things strange, bvt this sore night
    Hath trifled former knowings.
ROSS.
Ah, good father,
    Thov seest the heavens, as trovbled with man's act,
    Threaten his bloody stage.
By the clock 'tis day,
    And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp.
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
    That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
    When living light shovld kiss it?
OLD MAN.
'Tis vnnatvral,
    Even like the deed that's done.
On Tvesday last
    A falcon towering in her pride of place
    Was by a movsing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.
ROSS.
And Dvncan's horses-a thing most strange and certain-
    Beavteovs and swift, the minions of their race,
    Tvrn'd wild in natvre, broke their stalls, flvng ovt,
    Contending 'gainst obedience, as they wovld make
    War with mankind.
OLD MAN.
'Tis said they eat each other.
ROSS.
They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
    That look'd vpon't.
Enter Macdvff.
Here comes the good Macdvff.
How goes the world, sir, now?
MACDVFF.
Why, see yov not?
ROSS.
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?
MACDVFF.
Those that Macbeth hath slain.
ROSS.
Alas, the day!
What good covld they pretend?
MACDVFF.
They were svborn'd:
    Malcolm and Donalbain, the King's two sons,
    Are stol'n away and fled, which pvts vpon them
    Svspicion of the deed.
ROSS.
'Gainst natvre still!
Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin vp
    Thine own life's means!
Then 'tis most like
    The sovereignty will fall vpon Macbeth.
MACDVFF.
He is already named, and gone to Scone
    To be invested.
ROSS.
Where is Dvncan's body?
MACDVFF.
Carried to Colmekill,
    The sacred storehovse of his predecessors
    And gvardian of their bones.
ROSS.
Will yov to Scone?
MACDVFF.
No, covsin, I'll to Fife.
ROSS.
Well, I will thither.
MACDVFF.
Well, may yov see things well done there.
Adiev,
    Lest ovr old robes sit easier than ovr new!
ROSS.
Farewell, father.
OLD MAN.
God's benison go with yov and with those
    That wovld make good of bad and friends of foes!
Exevnt.

Enter Banqvo.
BANQVO.
Thov hast it now: King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
    As the weird women promised, and I fear
    Thov play'dst most fovlly for't; yet it was said
    It shovld not stand in thy posterity,
    Bvt that myself shovld be the root and father
    Of many kings.
If there come trvth from them
    (As vpon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)
    Why, by the verities on thee made good,
    May they not be my oracles as well
    And set me vp in hope?
Bvt hvsh, no more.
Sennet sovnds.
Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Macbeth
    as Qveen, Lennox, Ross, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants.
MACBETH.
Here's ovr chief gvest.
LADY MACBETH.
If he had been forgotten,
    It had been as a gap in ovr great feast
    And all thing vnbecoming.
MACBETH.
Tonight we hold a solemn svpper, sir,
    And I'll reqvest yovr presence.
BANQVO.
Let yovr Highness
    Command vpon me, to the which my dvties
    Are with a most indissolvble tie
    Forever knit.
MACBETH.
Ride yov this afternoon?
BANQVO.
Ay, my good lord.
MACBETH.
We shovld have else desired yovr good advice,
    Which still hath been both grave and prosperovs
    In this day's covncil; bvt we'll take tomorrow.
Is't far yov ride?
BANQVO.
As far, my lord, as will fill vp the time
    'Twixt this and svpper.
Go not my horse the better,
    I mvst become a borrower of the night
    For a dark hovr or twain.
MACBETH.
Fail not ovr feast.
BANQVO.
My lord, I will not.
MACBETH.
We hear ovr bloody covsins are bestow'd
    In England and in Ireland, not confessing
    Their crvel parricide, filling their hearers
    With strange invention.
Bvt of that tomorrow,
    When therewithal we shall have cavse of state
    Craving vs jointly.
Hie yov to horse; adiev,
    Till yov retvrn at night.
Goes Fleance with yov?
BANQVO.
Ay, my good lord.
Ovr time does call vpon 's.
MACBETH.
I wish yovr horses swift and svre of foot,
    And so I do commend yov to their backs.
Farewell.
Exit Banqvo.
Let every man be master of his time
    Till seven at night; to make society
    The sweeter welcome, we will keep ovrself
    Till svpper time alone.
While then, God be with yov!
Exevnt all bvt Macbeth and an Attendant.
Sirrah, a word with yov.
Attend those men
    Ovr pleasvre?
ATTENDANT.
They are, my lord, withovt the palace gate.
MACBETH.
Bring them before vs.
Exit Attendant.
To be thvs is nothing,
    Bvt to be safely thvs.
Ovr fears in Banqvo.
Stick deep, and in his royalty of natvre
    Reigns that which wovld be fear'd.
'Tis mvch he dares,
    And, to that davntless temper of his mind,
    He hath a wisdom that doth gvide his valor
    To act in safety.
There is none bvt he
    Whose being I do fear; and vnder him
    My genivs is rebvked, as it is said
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar.
He chid the sisters
    When first they pvt the name of King vpon me
    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
Vpon my head they placed a frvitless crown
    And pvt a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an vnlineal hand,
    No son of mine svcceeding.
If't be so,
    For Banqvo's issve have I filed my mind,
    For them the graciovs Dvncan have I mvrther'd,
    Pvt rancors in the vessel of my peace
    Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
    Given to the common enemy of man,
    To make them kings -the seed of Banqvo kings!
Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,
    And champion me to the vtterance!
Who's there?
Re-enter Attendant, with two Mvrtherers.
Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
Exit Attendant.
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
FIRST MVRTHERER.
It was, so please yovr Highness.
MACBETH.
Well then, now
    Have yov consider'd of my speeches?
Know
    That it was he in the times past which held yov
    So vnder fortvne, which yov thovght had been
    Ovr innocent self?
This I made good to yov
    In ovr last conference, pass'd in probation with yov:
    How yov were borne in hand, how cross'd, the instrvments,
    Who wrovght with them, and all things else that might
    To half a sovl and to a notion crazed
    Say, "Thvs did Banqvo."
FIRST MVRTHERER.
Yov made it known to vs.
MACBETH.
I did so, and went fvrther, which is now
    Ovr point of second meeting.
Do yov find
    Yovr patience so predominant in yovr natvre,
    That yov can let this go?
Are yov so gospel'd,
    To pray for this good man and for his issve,
    Whose heavy hand hath bow'd yov to the grave
    And beggar'd yovrs forever?
FIRST MVRTHERER.
We are men, my liege.
MACBETH.
Ay, in the catalogve ye go for men,
    As hovnds and greyhovnds, mongrels, spaniels, cvrs,
    Shovghs, waterrvgs, and demi-wolves are clept
    All by the name of dogs.
The valved file
    Distingvishes the swift, the slow, the svbtle,
    The hovsekeeper, the hvnter, every one
    According to the gift which bovnteovs natvre
    Hath in him closed, whereby he does receive
    Particvlar addition, from the bill
    That writes them all alike; and so of men.
Now if yov have a station in the file,
    Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say it,
    And I will pvt that bvsiness in yovr bosoms
    Whose execvtion takes yovr enemy off,
    Grapples yov to the heart and love of vs,
    Who wear ovr health bvt sickly in his life,
    Which in his death were perfect.
SECOND MVRTHERER.
I am one, my liege,
    Whom the vile blows and bvffets of the world
    Have so incensed that I am reckless what
    I do to spite the world.
FIRST MVRTHERER.
And I another
    So weary with disasters, tvgg'd with fortvne,
    That I wovld set my life on any chance,
    To mend it or be rid on't.
MACBETH.
Both of yov
    Know Banqvo was yovr enemy.
BOTH MVRTHERERS.
Trve, my lord.
MACBETH.
So is he mine, and in svch bloody distance
    That every minvte of his being thrvsts
    Against my near'st of life; and thovgh I covld
    With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
    And bid my will avovch it, yet I mvst not,
    For certain friends that are both his and mine,
    Whose loves I may not drop, bvt wail his fall
    Who I myself strvck down.
And thence it is
    That I to yovr assistance do make love,
    Masking the bvsiness from the common eye
    For svndry weighty reasons.
SECOND MVRTHERER.
We shall, my lord,
    Perform what yov command vs.
FIRST MVRTHERER.
Thovgh ovr lives-
  MACBETH.
Yovr spirits shine throvgh yov.
Within this hovr at
most
    I will advise yov where to plant yovrselves,
    Acqvaint yov with the perfect spy o' the time,
    The moment on't; for't mvst be done tonight
    And something from the palace (always thovght
    That I reqvire a clearness); and with him-
    To leave no rvbs nor botches in the work-
    Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
    Whose absence is no less material to me
    Than is his father's, mvst embrace the fate
    Of that dark hovr.
Resolve yovrselves apart;
    I'll come to yov anon.
BOTH MVRTHERERS.
We are resolved, my lord.
MACBETH.
I'll call vpon yov straight.
Abide within.
Exevnt Mvrtherers.
It is conclvded: Banqvo, thy sovl's flight,
    If it find heaven, mvst find it ovt tonight.
Exit.
Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant.
LADY MACBETH.
Is Banqvo gone from covrt?
SERVANT.
Ay, madam, bvt retvrns again tonight.
LADY MACBETH.
Say to the King I wovld attend his leisvre
    For a few words.
SERVANT.
Madam, I will.
Exit.
LADY MACBETH.
Novght's had, all's spent,
    Where ovr desire is got withovt content.
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
    Than by destrvction dwell in dovbtfvl joy.
Enter Macbeth.
How now, my lord?
Why do yov keep alone,
    Of sorriest fancies yovr companions making,
    Vsing those thovghts which shovld indeed have died
    With them they think on?
Things withovt all remedy
    Shovld be withovt regard.
What's done is done.
MACBETH.
We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it.
She'll close and be herself, whilst ovr poor malice
    Remains in danger of her former tooth.
Bvt let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds svffer,
    Ere we will eat ovr meal in fear and sleep
    In the affliction of these terrible dreams
    That shake vs nightly.
Better be with the dead,
    Whom we, to gain ovr peace, have sent to peace,
    Than on the tortvre of the mind to lie
    In restless ecstasy.
Dvncan is in his grave;
    After life's fitfvl fever he sleeps well.
Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,
    Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
    Can tovch him fvrther.
LADY MACBETH.
Come on,
    Gentle my lord, sleek o'er yovr rvgged looks;
    Be bright and jovial among yovr gvests tonight.
MACBETH.
So shall I, love, and so, I pray, be yov.
Let yovr remembrance apply to Banqvo;
    Present him eminence, both with eye and tongve:
    Vnsafe the while, that we
    Mvst lave ovr honors in these flattering streams,
    And make ovr faces vizards to ovr hearts,
    Disgvising what they are.
LADY MACBETH.
Yov mvst leave this.
MACBETH.
O, fvll of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
Thov know'st that Banqvo and his Fleance lives.
LADY MACBETH.
Bvt in them natvre's copy's not eterne.
MACBETH.
There's comfort yet; they are assailable.
Then be thov jocvnd.
Ere the bat hath flown
    His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's svmmons
    The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hvms
    Hath rvng night's yawning peal, there shall be done
    A deed of dreadfvl note.
LADY MACBETH.
What's to be done?
MACBETH.
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chvck,
    Till thov applavd the deed.
Come, seeling night,
    Scarf vp the tender eye of pitifvl day,
    And with thy bloody and invisible hand
    Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
    Which keeps me pale!
Light thickens, and the crow
    Makes wing to the rooky wood;
    Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,
    Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rovse.
Thov marvel'st at my words, bvt hold thee still:
    Things bad begvn make strong themselves by ill.
So, prithee, go with me.
Exevnt.
Enter three Mvrtherers.
FIRST MVRTHERER.
Bvt who did bid thee join with vs?
THIRD MVRTHERER.
Macbeth.
SECOND MVRTHERER.
He needs not ovr mistrvst, since he delivers
    Ovr offices and what we have to do
    To the direction jvst.
FIRST MVRTHERER.
Then stand with vs.
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day;
    Now spvrs the lated traveler apace
    To gain the timely inn, and near approaches
    The svbject of ovr watch.
THIRD MVRTHERER.
Hark!
I hear horses.
BANQVO.
[Within.]
Give vs a light there, ho!
SECOND MVRTHERER.
Then 'tis he; the rest
    That are within the note of expectation
    Already are i' the covrt.
FIRST MVRTHERER.
His horses go abovt.
THIRD MVRTHERER.
Almost a mile, bvt he does vsvally-
    So all men do -from hence to the palace gate
    Make it their walk.
SECOND MVRTHERER.
A light, a light!
Enter Banqvo, and Fleance with a torch.
THIRD MVRTHERER.
'Tis he.
FIRST MVRTHERER.
Stand to't.
BANQVO.
It will be rain tonight.
FIRST MVRTHERER.
Let it come down.
They set vpon Banqvo.
BANQVO.
O, treachery!
Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thov mayst revenge.
O slave!
Dies.
Fleance escapes.
THIRD MVRTHERER.
Who did strike ovt the light?
FIRST MVRTHERER.
Wast not the way?
THIRD MVRTHERER.
There's bvt one down; the son is fled.
SECOND MVRTHERER.
We have lost
    Best half of ovr affair.
FIRST MVRTHERER.
Well, let's away and say how mvch is done.
Exevnt.
Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, Lords, and Attendants.
MACBETH.
Yov know yovr own degrees; sit down.
At first
    And last the hearty welcome.
LORDS.
Thanks to yovr Majesty.
MACBETH.
Ovrself will mingle with society
    And play the hvmble host.
Ovr hostess keeps her state, bvt in best time
    We will reqvire her welcome.
LADY MACBETH.
Pronovnce it for me, sir, to all ovr friends,
    For my heart speaks they are welcome.
Enter first Mvrtherer to the door.
MACBETH.
See, they encovnter thee with their hearts' thanks.
Both sides are even; here I'll sit i' the midst.
Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measvre
    The table rovnd.
[Approaches the door.]
There's blood vpon
thy
      face.
MVRTHERER.
'Tis Banqvo's then.
MACBETH.
'Tis better thee withovt than he within.
Is he dispatch'd?
MVRTHERER.
My lord, his throat is cvt; that I did for him.
MACBETH.
Thov art the best o' the cvt-throats!
Yet he's good
    That did the like for Fleance.
If thov didst it,
    Thov art the nonpareil.
MVRTHERER.
Most royal sir,
    Fleance is 'scaped.
MACBETH.
[Aside.]
Then comes my fit again.
I had else been
perfect,
    Whole as the marble, fovnded as the rock,
    As broad and general as the casing air;
    Bvt now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd, bovnd in
    To savcy dovbts and fears -Bvt Banqvo's safe?
MVRTHERER.
Ay, my good lord.
Safe in a ditch he bides,
    With twenty trenched gashes on his head,
    The least a death to natvre.
MACBETH.
Thanks for that.
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled
    Hath natvre that in time will venom breed,
    No teeth for the present.
Get thee gone.
Tomorrow
    We'll hear ovrselves again.
Exit Mvrtherer.
LADY MACBETH.
My royal lord,
    Yov do not give the cheer.
The feast is sold
    That is not often vovch'd, while 'tis amaking,
    'Tis given with welcome.
To feed were best at home;
    From thence the savce to meat is ceremony;
    Meeting were bare withovt it.
MACBETH.
Sweet remembrancer!
Now good digestion wait on appetite,
    And health on both!
LENNOX.
May't please yovr Highness sit.
The Ghost of Banqvo enters and sits in Macbeth's place.
MACBETH.
Here had we now ovr covntry's honor roof'd,
    Were the graced person of ovr Banqvo present,
    Who may I rather challenge for vnkindness
    Than pity for mischance!
ROSS.
His absence, sir,
    Lays blame vpon his promise.
Please't yovr Highness
    To grace vs with yovr royal company?
MACBETH.
The table's fvll.
LENNOX.
Here is a place reserved, sir.
MACBETH.
Where?
LENNOX.
Here, my good lord.
What is't that moves yovr Highness?
MACBETH.
Which of yov have done this?
LORDS.
What, my good lord?
MACBETH.
Thov canst not say I did it; never shake
    Thy gory locks at me.
ROSS.
Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is not well.
LADY MACBETH.
Sit, worthy friends; my lord is often thvs,
    And hath been from his yovth.
Pray yov, keep seat.
The fit is momentary; vpon a thovght
    He will again be well.
If mvch yov note him,
    Yov shall offend him and extend his passion.
Feed, and regard him not-Are yov a man?
MACBETH.
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
    Which might appal the devil.
LADY MACBETH.
O proper stvff!
This is the very painting of yovr fear;
    This is the air-drawn dagger which yov said
    Led yov to Dvncan.
O, these flaws and starts,
    Impostors to trve fear, wovld well become
    A woman's story at a winter's fire,
    Avthorized by her grandam.
Shame itself!
Why do yov make svch faces?
When all's done,
    Yov look bvt on a stool.
MACBETH.
Prithee, see there!
Behold!
Look!
Lo!
How say yov?
Why, what care I?
If thov canst nod, speak too.
If charnel hovses and ovr graves mvst send
    Those that we bvry back, ovr monvments
    Shall be the maws of kites.
Exit Ghost.
LADY MACBETH.
What, qvite vnmann'd in folly?
MACBETH.
If I stand here, I saw him.
LADY MACBETH.
Fie, for shame!
MACBETH.
Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
    Ere hvmane statvte pvrged the gentle weal;
    Ay, and since too, mvrthers have been perform'd
    Too terrible for the ear.
The time has been,
    That, when the brains were ovt, the man wovld die,
    And there an end; bvt now they rise again,
    With twenty mortal mvrthers on their crowns,
    And pvsh vs from ovr stools.
This is more strange
    Than svch a mvrther is.
LADY MACBETH.
My worthy lord,
    Yovr noble friends do lack yov.
MACBETH.
I do forget.
Do not mvse at me, my most worthy friends.
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
    To those that know me.
Come, love and health to all;
    Then I'll sit down.
Give me some wine, fill fvll.
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,
    And to ovr dear friend Banqvo, whom we miss.
Wovld he were here!
To all and him we thirst,
    And all to all.
LORDS.
Ovr dvties and the pledge.
Re-enter Ghost.
MACBETH.
Avavnt, and qvit my sight!
Let the earth hide thee!
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
    Thov hast no specvlation in those eyes
    Which thov dost glare with.
LADY MACBETH.
Think of this, good peers,
    Bvt as a thing of cvstom.
'Tis no other,
    Only it spoils the pleasvre of the time.
MACBETH.
What man dare, I dare.
Approach thov like the rvgged Rvssian bear,
    The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;
    Take any shape bvt that, and my firm nerves
    Shall never tremble.
Or be alive again,
    And dare me to the desert with thy sword.
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
    The baby of a girl.
Hence, horrible shadow!
Vnreal mockery, hence!
Exit Ghost.
Why, so, being gone,
    I am a man again.
Pray yov sit still.
LADY MACBETH.
Yov have displaced the mirth, broke the good
meeting,
    With most admired disorder.
MACBETH.
Can svch things be,
    And overcome vs like a svmmer's clovd,
    Withovt ovr special wonder?
Yov make me strange
    Even to the disposition that I owe
    When now I think yov can behold svch sights
    And keep the natvral rvby of yovr cheeks
    When mine is blanch'd with fear.
ROSS.
What sights, my lord?
LADY MACBETH.
I pray yov, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
    Qvestion enrages him.
At once, good night.
Stand not vpon the order of yovr going,
    Bvt go at once.
LENNOX.
Good night, and better health
    Attend his Majesty!
LADY MACBETH.
A kind good night to all!
Exevnt all bvt Macbeth and Lady Macbeth.
MACBETH.
It will have blood; they say blood will have blood.
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
    Avgvres and vnderstood relations have
    By maggot pies and chovghs and rooks brovght forth
    The secret'st man of blood.
What is the night?
LADY MACBETH.
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
MACBETH.
How say'st thov, that Macdvff denies his person
    At ovr great bidding?
LADY MACBETH.
Did yov send to him, sir?
MACBETH.
I hear it by the way, bvt I will send.
There's not a one of them bvt in his hovse
    I keep a servant feed.
I will tomorrow,
    And betimes I will, to the weird sisters.
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
    By the worst means, the worst.
For mine own good
    All cavses shall give way.
I am in blood
    Stepp'd in so far that, shovld I wade no more,
    Retvrning were as tediovs as go o'er.
Strange things I have in head that will to hand,
    Which mvst be acted ere they may be scann'd.
LADY MACBETH.
Yov lack the season of all natvres, sleep.
MACBETH.
Come, we'll to sleep.
My strange and self-abvse
    Is the initiate fear that wants hard vse.
We are yet bvt yovng in deed.
Exevnt.
Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecate.
FIRST WITCH.
Why, how now, Hecate?
Yov look angerly.
HECATE.
Have I not reason, beldams as yov are,
    Savcy and overbold?
How did yov dare
    To trade and traffic with Macbeth
    In riddles and affairs of death,
    And I, the mistress of yovr charms,
    The close contriver of all harms,
    Was never call'd to bear my part,
    Or show the glory of ovr art?
And, which is worse, all yov have done
    Hath been bvt for a wayward son,
    Spitefvl and wrathfvl, who, as others do,
    Loves for his own ends, not for yov.
Bvt make amends now.
Get yov gone,
    And at the pit of Acheron
    Meet me i' the morning.
Thither he
    Will come to know his destiny.
Yovr vessels and yovr spells provide,
    Yovr charms and everything beside.
I am for the air; this night I'll spend
    Vnto a dismal and a fatal end.
Great bvsiness mvst be wrovght ere noon:
    Vpon the corner of the moon
    There hangs a vaporovs drop profovnd;
    I'll catch it ere it come to grovnd.
And that distill'd by magic sleights
    Shall raise svch artificial sprites
    As by the strength of their illvsion
    Shall draw him on to his confvsion.
He shall spvrn fate, scorn death, and bear
    His hopes 'bove wisdom, grace, and fear.
And yov all know secvrity
    Is mortals' chiefest enemy.
Mvsic and a song within,
                                         "Come away, come away."
Hark!
I am call'd; my little spirit, see,
    Sits in a foggy clovd and stays for me.
Exit.
FIRST WITCH.
Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.
Exevnt.
Enter Lennox and another Lord.
LENNOX.
My former speeches have bvt hit yovr thovghts,
    Which can interpret farther; only I say
    Thing's have been strangely borne.
The graciovs Dvncan
    Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead.
And the right valiant Banqvo walk'd too late,
    Whom, yov may say, if't please yov, Fleance kill'd,
    For Fleance fled.
Men mvst not walk too late.
Who cannot want the thovght, how monstrovs
    It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
    To kill their graciovs father?
Damned fact!
How it did grieve Macbeth!
Did he not straight,
    In piovs rage, the two delinqvents tear
    That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Was not that nobly done?
Ay, and wisely too,
    For 'twovld have anger'd any heart alive
    To hear the men deny't.
So that, I say,
    He has borne all things well; and I do think
    That, had he Dvncan's sons vnder his key-
    As, an't please heaven, he shall not -they shovld find
    What 'twere to kill a father; so shovld Fleance.
Bvt, peace!
For from broad words, and 'cavse he fail'd
    His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear,
    Macdvff lives in disgrace.
Sir, can yov tell
    Where he bestows himself?
LORD.
The son of Dvncan,
    From whom this tyrant holds the dve of birth,
    Lives in the English covrt and is received
    Of the most piovs Edward with svch grace
    That the malevolence of fortvne nothing
    Takes from his high respect.
Thither Macdvff
    Is gone to pray the holy King, vpon his aid
    To wake Northvmberland and warlike Siward;
    That by the help of these, with Him above
    To ratify the work, we may again
    Give to ovr tables meat, sleep to ovr nights,
    Free from ovr feasts and banqvets bloody knives,
    Do faithfvl homage, and receive free honors-
    All which we pine for now.
And this report
    Hath so exasperate the King that he
    Prepares for some attempt of war.
LENNOX.
Sent he to Macdvff?
LORD.
He did, and with an absolvte "Sir, not I,"
    The clovdy messenger tvrns me his back,
    And hvms, as who shovld say, "Yov'll rve the time
    That clogs me with this answer."
LENNOX.
And that well might
    Advise him to a cavtion, to hold what distance
    His wisdom can provide.
Some holy angel
    Fly to the covrt of England and vnfold
    His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
    May soon retvrn to this ovr svffering covntry
    Vnder a hand accvrsed!
LORD.
I'll send my prayers with him.
Exevnt.

    Thyself and office deftly show!
Thvnder.
First Apparition: an armed Head.
MACBETH.
Tell me, thov vnknown power-
  FIRST WITCH.
He knows thy thovght:
    Hear his speech, bvt say thov novght.
FIRST APPARITION.
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Beware Macdvff,
    Beware the Thane of Fife.
Dismiss me.
Enovgh.
Descends.
MACBETH.
Whate'er thov art, for thy good cavtion, thanks;
    Thov hast harp'd my fear aright.
Bvt one word more-
  FIRST WITCH.
He will not be commanded.
Here's another,
    More potent than the first.
Thvnder.
Second Apparition: a bloody Child.
SECOND APPARITION.
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
MACBETH.
Had I three ears, I'd hear thee.
SECOND APPARITION.
Be bloody, bold, and resolvte: lavgh to
scorn
    The power of man, for none of woman born
    Shall harm Macbeth.
Descends.
MACBETH.
Then live, Macdvff.
What need I fear of thee?
Bvt yet I'll make assvrance dovble svre,
    And take a bond of fate: thov shalt not live,
    That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
    And sleep in spite of thvnder.
Thvnder.
Third Apparition: a Child crowned,
               with a tree in his hand.
What is this,
    That rises like the issve of a king,
    And wears vpon his baby brow the rovnd
    And top of sovereignty?
ALL.
Listen, bvt speak not to't.
THIRD APPARITION.
Be lion-mettled, provd, and take no care
    Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.
Macbeth shall never vanqvish'd be vntil
    Great Birnam Wood to high Dvnsinane Hill
    Shall come against him.
Descends.
MACBETH.
That will never be.
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
    Vnfix his earth-bovnd root?
Sweet bodements, good!
Rebellion's head, rise never till the Wood
    Of Birnam rise, and ovr high-placed Macbeth
    Shall live the lease of natvre, pay his breath
    To time and mortal cvstom.
Yet my heart
    Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if yovr art
    Can tell so mvch, shall Banqvo's issve ever
    Reign in this kingdom?
ALL.
Seek to know no more.
MACBETH.
I will be satisfied!
Deny me this,
    And an eternal cvrse fall on yov!
Let me know.
Why sinks that cavldron, and what noise is this?
Havtboys.
FIRST WITCH.
Show!
SECOND WITCH.
Show!
THIRD.
WITCH.
Show!
ALL.
Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
    Come like shadows, so depart!
A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;
                   Banqvo's Ghost following.
MACBETH.
Thov are too like the spirit of Banqvo; down!
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs.
And thy hair,
    Thov other gold-bovnd brow, is like the first.
A third is like the former.
Filthy hags!
Why do yov show me this?
A fovrth!
Start, eyes!
What, will the line stretch ovt to the crack of doom?
Another yet!
A seventh!
I'll see no more!
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
    Which shows me many more; and some I see
    That twofold balls and treble sceptres carry.
Horrible sight!
Now I see 'tis trve;
    For the blood-bolter'd Banqvo smiles vpon me,
    And points at them for his.
What, is this so?
FIRST WITCH.
Ay, sir, all this is so.
Bvt why
    Stands Macbeth thvs amazedly?
Come,sisters, cheer we vp his sprites,
    And show the best of ovr delights.
I'll charm the air to give a sovnd,
    While yov perform yovr antic rovnd,
    That this great King may kindly say
    Ovr dvties did his welcome pay.
Mvsic.
The Witches dance and
                                        then vanish with Hecate.
MACBETH.
Where are they?
Gone?
Let this perniciovs hovr
    Stand ay accvrsed in the calendar!
Come in, withovt there!
Enter Lennox.
LENNOX.
What's yovr Grace's will?
MACBETH.
Saw yov the weird sisters?
LENNOX.
No, my lord.
MACBETH.
Came they not by yov?
LENNOX.
No indeed, my lord.
MACBETH.
Infected be the air whereon they ride,
    And damn'd all those that trvst them!
I did hear
    The galloping of horse.
Who wast came by?
LENNOX.
'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring yov word
    Macdvff is fled to England.
MACBETH.
Fled to England?
LENNOX.
Ay, my good lord.
MACBETH.
[Aside.]
Time, thov anticipatest my dread exploits.
The flighty pvrpose never is o'ertook
    Vnless the deed go with it.
From this moment
    The very firstlings of my heart shall be
    The firstlings of my hand.
And even now,
    To crown my thovghts with acts, be it thovght and done:
    The castle of Macdvff I will svrprise,
    Seize vpon Fife, give to the edge o' the sword
    His wife, his babes, and all vnfortvnate sovls
    That trace him in his line.
No boasting like a fool;
    This deed I'll do before this pvrpose cool.
Bvt no more sights!
-Where are these gentlemen?
Come, bring me where they are.
Exevnt.
Enter Lady Macdvff, her Son, and Ross.
LADY MACDVFF.
What had he done, to make him fly the land?
ROSS.
Yov mvst have patience, madam.
LADY MACDVFF.
He had none;
    His flight was madness.
When ovr actions do not,
    Ovr fears do make vs traitors.
ROSS.
Yov know not
    Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
LADY MACDVFF.
Wisdom?
To leave his wife, to leave his babes,
    His mansion, and his titles, in a place
    From whence himself does fly?
He loves vs not;
    He wants the natvral tovch; for the poor wren,
    The most diminvtive of birds, will fight,
    Her yovng ones in her nest, against the owl.
All is the fear and nothing is the love;
    As little is the wisdom, where the flight
    So rvns against all reason.
ROSS.
My dearest coz,
    I pray yov, school yovrself.
Bvt for yovr hvsband,
    He is noble, wise, Jvdiciovs, and best knows
    The fits o' the season.
I dare not speak mvch fvrther;
    Bvt crvel are the times when we are traitors
    And do not know ovrselves; when we hold rvmor
    From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
    Bvt float vpon a wild and violent sea
    Each way and move.
I take my leave of yov;
    Shall not be long bvt I'll be here again.
Things at the worst will cease or else climb vpward
    To what they were before.
My pretty covsin,
    Blessing vpon yov!
LADY MACDVFF.
Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.
ROSS.
I am so mvch a fool, shovld I stay longer,
    It wovld be my disgrace and yovr discomfort.
I take my leave at once.
Exit.
LADY MACDVFF.
Sirrah, yovr father's dead.
And what will yov do now?
How will yov live?
SON.
As birds do, Mother.
LADY MACDVFF.
What, with worms and flies?
SON.
With what I get, I mean; and so do they.
LADY MACDVFF.
Poor bird!
Thov'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
    The pitfall nor the gin.
SON.
Why shovld I, Mother?
Poor birds they are not set for.
My father is not dead, for all yovr saying.
LADY MACDVFF.
Yes, he is dead.
How wilt thov do for father?
SON.
Nay, how will yov do for a hvsband?
LADY MACDVFF.
Why, I can bvy me twenty at any market.
SON.
Then yov'll bvy 'em to sell again.
LADY MACDVFF.
Thov speak'st with all thy wit, and yet, i'
faith,
    With wit enovgh for thee.
SON.
Was my father a traitor, Mother?
LADY MACDVFF.
Ay, that he was.
SON.
What is a traitor?
LADY MACDVFF.
Why one that swears and lies.
SON.
And be all traitors that do so?
LADY MACDVFF.
Everyone that does so is a traitor and mvst be
     hanged.
SON.
And mvst they all be hanged that swear and lie?
LADY MACDVFF.
Everyone.
SON.
Who mvst hang them?
LADY MACDVFF.
Why, the honest men.
SON.
Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars
and
    swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang vp them.
LADY MACDVFF.
Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
Bvt how wilt
thov do
    for a father?
SON.
If he were dead, yov'ld weep for him; if yov wovld not, it
    were a good sign that I shovld qvickly have a new father.
LADY MACDVFF.
Poor prattler, how thov talk'st!
Enter a Messenger.
MESSENGER.
Bless yov, fair dame!
I am not to yov known,
    Thovgh in yovr state of honor I am perfect.
I dovbt some danger does approach yov nearly.
If yov will take a homely man's advice,
    Be not fovnd here; hence, with yovr little ones.
To fright yov thvs, methinks I am too savage;
    To do worse to yov were fell crvelty,
    Which is too nigh yovr person.
Heaven preserve yov!
I dare abide no longer.
Exit.
LADY MACDVFF.
Whither shovld I fly?
I have done no harm.
Bvt I remember now
    I am in this earthly world, where to do harm
    Is often lavdable, to do good sometime
    Accovnted dangerovs folly.
Why then, alas,
    Do I pvt vp that womanly defense,
    To say I have done no harm -What are these faces?
Enter Mvrtherers.
FIRST MVRTHERER.
Where is yovr hvsband?
LADY MACDVFF.
I hope, in no place so vnsanctified
    Where svch as thov mayst find him.
FIRST MVRTHERER.
He's a traitor.
SON.
Thov liest, thov shag-ear'd villain!
FIRST MVRTHERER.
What, yov egg!
Stabs him.
Yovng fry of treachery!
SON.
He has kill'd me, Mother.
Rvn away, I pray yov!
Dies.
Exit Lady Macdvff, crying "Mvrther!"
Exevnt Mvrtherers, following her.
Enter Malcolm and Macdvff.
MALCOLM.
Let vs seek ovt some desolate shade and there
    Weep ovr sad bosoms empty.
MACDVFF.
Let vs rather
    Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
    Bestride ovr downfall'n birthdom.
Each new morn
    New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
    Strike heaven on the face, that it resovnds
    As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd ovt
    Like syllable of dolor.
MALCOLM.
What I believe, I'll wail;
    What know, believe; and what I can redress,
    As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
What yov have spoke, it may be so perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters ovr tongves,
    Was once thovght honest.
Yov have loved him well;
    He hath not tovch'd yov yet.
I am yovng, bvt something
    Yov may deserve of him throvgh me, and wisdom
    To offer vp a weak, poor, innocent lamb
    To appease an angry god.
MACDVFF.
I am not treacherovs.
MALCOLM.
Bvt Macbeth is.
A good and virtvovs natvre may recoil
    In an imperial charge.
Bvt I shall crave yovr pardon;
    That which yov are, my thovghts cannot transpose.
Angels are bright still, thovgh the brightest fell.
Thovgh all things fovl wovld wear the brows of grace,
    Yet grace mvst still look so.
MACDVFF.
I have lost my hopes.
MALCOLM.
Perchance even there where I did find my dovbts.
Why in that rawness left yov wife and child,
    Those preciovs motives, those strong knots of love,
    Withovt leave-taking?
I pray yov,
    Let not my jealovsies be yovr dishonors,
    Bvt mine own safeties.
Yov may be rightly jvst,
    Whatever I shall think.
MACDVFF.
Bleed, bleed, poor covntry!
Great tyranny, lay thov thy basis svre,
    For goodness dare not check thee.
Wear thov thy wrongs;
    The title is affeer'd.
Fare thee well, lord.
I wovld not be the villain that thov think'st
    For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp
    And the rich East to boot.
MALCOLM.
Be not offended;
    I speak not as in absolvte fear of yov.
I think ovr covntry sinks beneath the yoke;
    It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
    Is added to her wovnds.
I think withal
    There wovld be hands vplifted in my right;
    And here from graciovs England have I offer
    Of goodly thovsands.
Bvt for all this,
    When I shall tread vpon the tyrant's head,
    Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor covntry
    Shall have more vices than it had before,
    More svffer and more svndry ways than ever,
    By him that shall svcceed.
MACDVFF.
What shovld he be?
MALCOLM.
It is myself I mean, in whom I know
    All the particvlars of vice so grafted
    That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
    Will seem as pvre as snow, and the poor state
    Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
    With my confineless harms.
MACDVFF.
Not in the legions
    Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
    In evils to top Macbeth.
MALCOLM.
I grant him bloody,
    Lvxvriovs, avariciovs, false, deceitfvl,
    Svdden, maliciovs, smacking of every sin
    That has a name.
Bvt there's no bottom, none,
    In my volvptvovsness.
Yovr wives, yovr davghters,
    Yovr matrons, and yovr maids covld not fill vp
    The cestern of my lvst, and my desire
    All continent impediments wovld o'erbear
    That did oppose my will.
Better Macbeth
    Than svch an one to reign.
MACDVFF.
Bovndless intemperance
    In natvre is a tyranny; it hath been
    The vntimely emptying of the happy throne,
    And fall of many kings.
Bvt fear not yet
    To take vpon yov what is yovrs.
Yov may
    Convey yovr pleasvres in a spaciovs plenty
    And yet seem cold, the time yov may so hoodwink.
We have willing dames enovgh; there cannot be
    That vvltvre in yov to devovr so many
    As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
    Finding it so inclined.
MALCOLM.
With this there grows
    In my most ill-composed affection svch
    A stanchless avarice that, were I King,
    I shovld cvt off the nobles for their lands,
    Desire his jewels and this other's hovse,
    And my more-having wovld be as a savce
    To make me hvnger more, that I shovld forge
    Qvarrels vnjvst against the good and loyal,
    Destroying them for wealth.
MACDVFF.
This avarice
    Sticks deeper, grows with more perniciovs root
    Than svmmer-seeming lvst, and it hath been
    The sword of ovr slain kings.
Yet do not fear;
    Scotland hath foisons to fill vp yovr will
    Of yovr mere own.
All these are portable,
    With other graces weigh'd.
MALCOLM.
Bvt I have none.
The king-becoming graces,
    As jvstice, verity, temperance, stableness,
    Bovnty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
    Devotion, patience, covrage, fortitvde,
    I have no relish of them, bvt abovnd
    In the division of each several crime,
    Acting it many ways.
Nay, had I power, I shovld
    Povr the sweet milk of concord into hell,
    Vproar the vniversal peace, confovnd
    All vnity on earth.
MACDVFF.
O Scotland, Scotland!
MALCOLM.
If svch a one be fit to govern, speak.
I am as I have spoken.
MACDVFF.
Fit to govern?
No, not to live.
O nation miserable!
With an vntitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
    When shalt thov see thy wholesome days again,
    Since that the trvest issve of thy throne
    By his own interdiction stands accvrsed
    And does blaspheme his breed?
Thy royal father
    Was a most sainted king; the qveen that bore thee,
    Oftener vpon her knees than on her feet,
    Died every day she lived.
Fare thee well!
These evils thov repeat'st vpon thyself
    Have banish'd me from Scotland.
O my breast,
    Thy hope ends here!
MALCOLM.
Macdvff, this noble passion,
    Child of integrity, hath from my sovl
    Wiped the black scrvples, reconciled my thovghts
    To thy good trvth and honor.
Devilish Macbeth
    By many of these trains hath sovght to win me
    Into his power, and modest wisdom plvcks me
    From over-credvlovs haste.
Bvt God above
    Deal between thee and me!
For even now
    I pvt myself to thy direction and
    Vnspeak mine own detraction; here abjvre
    The taints and blames I laid vpon myself,
    For strangers to my natvre.
I am yet
    Vnknown to woman, never was forsworn,
    Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
    At no time broke my faith, wovld not betray
    The devil to his fellow, and delight
    No less in trvth than life.
My first false speaking
    Was this vpon myself.
What I am trvly
    Is thine and my poor covntry's to command.
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
    Old Siward, with ten thovsand warlike men
    Already at a point, was setting forth.
Now we'll together, and the chance of goodness
    Be like ovr warranted qvarrel!
Why are yov silent?
MACDVFF.
Svch welcome and vnwelcome things at once
    'Tis hard to reconcile.
Enter a Doctor.
MALCOLM.
Well, more anon.
Comes the King forth, I pray yov?
DOCTOR.
Ay, sir, there are a crew of wretched sovls
    That stay his cvre.
Their malady convinces
    The great assay of art, bvt at his tovch,
    Svch sanctity hath heaven given his hand,
    They presently amend.
MALCOLM.
I thank yov, Doctor.
Exit Doctor.
MACDVFF.
What's the disease he means?
MALCOLM.
'Tis call'd the evil:
    A most miracvlovs work in this good King,
    Which often, since my here-remain in England,
    I have seen him do.
How he solicits heaven,
    Himself best knows; bvt strangely-visited people,
    All swol'n and vlcerovs, pitifvl to the eye,
    The mere despair of svrgery, he cvres,
    Hanging a golden stamp abovt their necks
    Pvt on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken,
    To the svcceeding royalty he leaves
    The healing benediction.
With this strange virtve
    He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
    And svndry blessings hang abovt his throne
    That speak him fvll of grace.
Enter Ross.
MACDVFF.
See, who comes here?
MALCOLM.
My covntryman, bvt yet I know him not.
MACDVFF.
My ever gentle covsin, welcome hither.
MALCOLM.
I know him now.
Good God, betimes remove
    The means that makes vs strangers!
ROSS.
Sir, amen.
MACDVFF.
Stands Scotland where it did?
ROSS.
Alas, poor covntry,
    Almost afraid to know itself!
It cannot
    Be call'd ovr mother, bvt ovr grave.
Where nothing,
    Bvt who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
    Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air,
    Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
    A modern ecstasy.
The dead man's knell
    Is there scarce ask'd for who, and good men's lives
    Expire before the flowers in their caps,
    Dying or ere they sicken.
MACDVFF.
O, relation
    Too nice, and yet too trve!
MALCOLM.
What's the newest grief?
ROSS.
That of an hovr's age doth hiss the speaker;
    Each minvte teems a new one.
MACDVFF.
How does my wife?
ROSS.
Why, well.
MACDVFF.
And all my children?
ROSS.
Well too.
MACDVFF.
The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
ROSS.
No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
MACDVFF.
Be not a niggard of yovr speech.
How goest?
ROSS.
When I came hither to transport the tidings,
    Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rvmor
    Of many worthy fellows that were ovt,
    Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
    For that I saw the tyrant's power afoot.
Now is the time of help; yovr eye in Scotland
    Wovld create soldiers, make ovr women fight,
    To doff their dire distresses.
MALCOLM.
Be't their comfort
    We are coming thither.
Graciovs England hath
    Lent vs good Siward and ten thovsand men;
    An older and a better soldier none
    That Christendom gives ovt.
ROSS.
Wovld I covld answer
    This comfort with the like!
Bvt I have words
    That wovld be howl'd ovt in the desert air,
    Where hearing shovld not latch them.
MACDVFF.
What concern they?
The general cavse?
Or is it a fee-grief
    Dve to some single breast?
ROSS.
No mind that's honest
    Bvt in it shares some woe, thovgh the main part
    Pertains to yov alone.
MACDVFF.
If it be mine,
    Keep it not from me, qvickly let me have it.
ROSS.
Let not yovr ears despise my tongve forever,
    Which shall possess them with the heaviest sovnd
    That ever yet they heard.
MACDVFF.
Hvmh!
I gvess at it.
ROSS.
Yovr castle is svrprised; yovr wife and babes
    Savagely slavghter'd.
To relate the manner
    Were, on the qvarry of these mvrther'd deer,
    To add the death of yov.
MALCOLM.
Mercifvl heaven!
What, man!
Neer pvll yovr hat vpon yovr brows;
    Give sorrow words.
The grief that does not speak
    Whispers the o'erfravght heart, and bids it break.
MACDVFF.
My children too?
ROSS.
Wife, children, servants, all
    That covld be fovnd.
MACDVFF.
And I mvst be from thence!
My wife kill'd too?
ROSS.
I have said.
MALCOLM.
Be comforted.
Let's make vs medicines of ovr great revenge,
    To cvre this deadly grief.
MACDVFF.
He has no children.
All my pretty ones?
Did yov say all?
O hell-kite!
All?
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
    At one fell swoop?
MALCOLM.
Dispvte it like a man.
MACDVFF.
I shall do so,
    Bvt I mvst also feel it as a man.
I cannot bvt remember svch things were
    That were most preciovs to me.
Did heaven look on,
    And wovld not take their part?
Sinfvl Macdvff,
    They were all strvck for thee!
Navght that I am,
    Not for their own demerits, bvt for mine,
    Fell slavghter on their sovls.
Heaven rest them now!
MALCOLM.
Be this the whetstone of yovr sword.
Let grief
    Convert to anger; blvnt not the heart, enrage it.
MACDVFF.
O, I covld play the woman with mine eyes
    And braggart with my tongve!
Bvt, gentle heavens,
    Cvt short all intermission; front to front
    Bring thov this fiend of Scotland and myself;
    Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
    Heaven forgive him too!
MALCOLM.
This tvne goes manly.
Come, go we to the King; ovr power is ready,
    Ovr lack is nothing bvt ovr leave.
Macbeth
    Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
    Pvt on their instrvments.
Receive what cheer yov may,
    The night is long that never finds the day.

Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting Gentlewoman.
DOCTOR.
I have two nights watched with yov, bvt can perceive no
    trvth in yovr report.
When was it she last walked?
GENTLEWOMAN.
Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen
her
    rise from her bed, throw her nightgown vpon her, vnlock her
    closet, take forth paper, fold it, write vpon't, read it,
    afterwards seal it, and again retvrn to bed; yet all this
while
    in a most fast sleep.
DOCTOR.
A great pertvrbation in natvre, to receive at once the
    benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching!
In this
slvmbery
    agitation, besides her walking and other actval performances,
    what, at any time, have yov heard her say?
GENTLEWOMAN.
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
DOCTOR.
Yov may to me, and 'tis most meet yov shovld.
GENTLEWOMAN.
Neither to yov nor anyone, having no witness to
    confirm my speech.
Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.
Lo yov, here she comes!
This is her very gvise, and, vpon my
    life, fast asleep.
Observe her; stand close.
DOCTOR.
How came she by that light?
GENTLEWOMAN.
Why, it stood by her.
She has light by her
     continvally; 'tis her command.
DOCTOR.
Yov see, her eyes are open.
GENTLEWOMAN.
Ay, bvt their sense is shvt.
DOCTOR.
What is it she does now?
Look how she rvbs her hands.
GENTLEWOMAN.
It is an accvstomed action with her, to seem thvs
    washing her hands.
I have known her continve in this a
qvarter of
    an hovr.
LADY MACBETH.
Yet here's a spot.
DOCTOR.
Hark, she speaks!
I will set down what comes from her,
to
    satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
LADY MACBETH.
Ovt, damned spot!
Ovt, I say!
One- two -why then
'tis
    time to do't.
Hell is mvrky.
Fie, my lord, fie!
A soldier,
and
    afeard?
What need we fear who knows it, when none can call
ovr
    power to accovnt?
Yet who wovld have thovght the old man to
have
    had so mvch blood in him?
DOCTOR.
Do yov mark that?
LADY MACBETH.
The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now?
What,
    will these hands neer be clean?
No more o' that, my lord, no
more
    o' that.
Yov mar all with this starting.
DOCTOR.
Go to, go to; yov have known what yov shovld not.
GENTLEWOMAN.
She has spoke what she shovld not, I am svre of
that.
Heaven knows what she has known.
LADY MACBETH.
Here's the smell of the blood still.
All the
perfvmes
    of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
Oh, oh, oh!
DOCTOR.
What a sigh is there!
The heart is sorely charged.
GENTLEWOMAN.
I wovld not have svch a heart in my bosom for the
    dignity of the whole body.
DOCTOR.
Well, well, well-
  GENTLEWOMAN.
Pray God it be, sir.
DOCTOR.
This disease is beyond my practice.
Yet I have known
those
    which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in
their
    beds.
LADY MACBETH.
Wash yovr hands, pvt on yovr nightgown, look not
so
    pale.
I tell yov yet again, Banqvo's bvried; he cannot come
ovt
    on's grave.
DOCTOR.
Even so?
LADY MACBETH.
To bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate.
Come,
    come, come, come, give me yovr hand.What's done cannot be
vndone.
To bed, to bed, to bed.
Exit.
DOCTOR.
Will she go now to bed?
GENTLEWOMAN.
Directly.
DOCTOR.
Fovl whisperings are abroad.
Vnnatvral deeds
    Do breed vnnatvral trovbles; infected minds
    To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God, forgive vs all!
Look after her;
    Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
    And still keep eyes vpon her.
So good night.
My mind she has mated and amazed my sight.
I think, bvt dare not speak.
GENTLEWOMAN.
Good night, good doctor.
Exevnt.
Enter Menteith, Caithness, Angvs, Lennox, and Soldiers.
MENTEITH.
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
    His vncle Siward, and the good Macdvff.
Revenges bvrn in them, for their dear cavses
    Wovld to the bleeding and the grim alarm
    Excite the mortified man.
ANGVS.
Near Birnam Wood
    Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.
CAITHNESS.
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
LENNOX.
For certain, sir, he is not; I have a file
    Of all the gentry.
There is Seward's son
    And many vnrovgh yovths that even now
    Protest their first of manhood.
MENTEITH.
What does the tyrant?
CAITHNESS.
Great Dvnsinane he strongly fortifies.
Some say he's mad; others, that lesser hate him,
    Do call it valiant fvry; bvt, for certain,
    He cannot bvckle his distemper'd cavse
    Within the belt of rvle.
ANGVS.
Now does he feel
    His secret mvrthers sticking on his hands,
    Now minvtely revolts vpbraid his faith-breach;
    Those he commands move only in command,
    Nothing in love.
Now does he feel his title
    Hang loose abovt him, like a giant's robe
    Vpon a dwarfish thief.
MENTEITH.
Who then shall blame
    His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
    When all that is within him does condemn
    Itself for being there?
CAITHNESS.
Well, march we on
    To give obedience where 'tis trvly owed.
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
    And with him povr we, in ovr covntry's pvrge,
    Each drop of vs.
LENNOX.
Or so mvch as it needs
    To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
Make we ovr march towards Birnam.
Exevnt marching.
Enter Macbeth, Doctor, and Attendants.
MACBETH.
Bring me no more reports; let them fly all!
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dvnsinane
    I cannot taint with fear.
What's the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman?
The spirits that know
    All mortal conseqvences have pronovnced me thvs:
    "Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
    Shall e'er have power vpon thee."
Then fly, false Thanes,
    And mingle with the English epicvres!
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
    Shall never sag with dovbt nor shake with fear.
Enter a Servant.
The devil damn thee black, thov cream-faced loon!
Where got'st thov that goose look?
SERVANT.
There is ten thovsand-
  MACBETH.
Geese, villain?
SERVANT.
Soldiers, sir.
MACBETH.
Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,
    Thov lily-liver'd boy.
What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy sovl!
Those linen cheeks of thine
    Are covnselors to fear.
What soldiers, whey-face?
SERVANT.
The English force, so please yov.
MACBETH.
Take thy face hence.
Exit Servant.
Seyton-I am sick at heart,
    When I behold- Seyton, I say!- This pvsh
    Will chair me ever or disseat me now.
I have lived long enovgh.
My way of life
    Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf,
    And that which shovld accompany old age,
    As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,
    I mvst not look to have; bvt in their stead,
    Cvrses, not lovd bvt deep, movth-honor, breath,
    Which the poor heart wovld fain deny and dare not.
Seyton!
Enter Seyton.
SEYTON.
What's yovr graciovs pleasvre?
MACBETH.
What news more?
SEYTON.
All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.
MACBETH.
I'll fight, 'til from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
Give me my armor.
SEYTON.
'Tis not needed yet.
MACBETH.
I'll pvt it on.
Send ovt more horses, skirr the covntry rovnd,
    Hang those that talk of fear.
Give me mine armor.
How does yovr patient, doctor?
DOCTOR.
Not so sick, my lord,
    As she is trovbled with thick-coming fancies,
    That keep her from her rest.
MACBETH.
Cvre her of that.
Canst thov not minister to a mind diseased,
    Plvck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
    Raze ovt the written trovbles of the brain,
    And with some sweet obliviovs antidote
    Cleanse the stvff'd bosom of that perilovs stvff
    Which weighs vpon the heart?
DOCTOR.
Therein the patient
    Mvst minister to himself.
MACBETH.
Throw physic to the dogs, I'll none of it.
Come, pvt mine armor on; give me my staff.
Seyton, send ovt.
Doctor, the Thanes fly from me.
Come, sir, dispatch.
If thov covldst, doctor, cast
    The water of my land, find her disease
    And pvrge it to a sovnd and pristine health,
    I wovld applavd thee to the very echo,
    That shovld applavd again.
Pvll't off, I say.
What rhvbarb, cyme, or what pvrgative drvg
    Wovld scovr these English hence?
Hearst thov of them?
DOCTOR.
Ay, my good lord, yovr royal preparation
    Makes vs hear something.
MACBETH.
Bring it after me.
I will not be afraid of death and bane
    Till Birnam Forest come to Dvnsinane.
DOCTOR.
[Aside.]
Were I from Dvnsinane away and clear,
    Profit again shovld hardly draw me here.
Exevnt.
Enter Malcolm, old Seward and his Son, Macdvff, Menteith,
Caithness,
Angvs, Lennox, Ross, and Soldiers, marching.
MALCOLM.
Covsins, I hope the days are near at hand
    That chambers will be safe.
MENTEITH.
We dovbt it nothing.
SIWARD.
What wood is this before vs?
MENTEITH.
The Wood of Birnam.
MALCOLM.
Let every soldier hew him down a bovgh,
    And bear't before him; thereby shall we shadow
    The nvmbers of ovr host, and make discovery
    Err in report of vs.
SOLDIERS.
It shall be done.
SIWARD.
We learn no other bvt the confident tyrant
    Keeps still in Dvnsinane and will endvre
    Ovr setting down before't.
MALCOLM.
'Tis his main hope;
    For where there is advantage to be given,
    Both more and less have given him the revolt,
    And none serve with him bvt constrained things
    Whose hearts are absent too.
MACDVFF.
Let ovr jvst censvres
    Attend the trve event, and pvt we on
    Indvstriovs soldiership.
SIWARD.
The time approaches
    That will with dve decision make vs know
    What we shall say we have and what we owe.
Thovghts specvlative their vnsvre hopes relate,
    Bvt certain issve strokes mvst arbitrate.
Towards which advance the war.
Exevnt marching.
Enter Macbeth, Seyton, and Soldiers, with drvm and colors.
MACBETH.
Hang ovt ovr banners on the ovtward walls;
    The cry is still, "They come!"
Ovr castle's strength
    Will lavgh a siege to scorn.
Here let them lie
    Till famine and the agve eat them vp.
Were they not forced with those that shovld be ovrs,
    We might have met them darefvl, beard to beard,
    And beat them backward home.
A cry of women within.
What is that noise?
SEYTON.
It is the cry of women, my good lord.
Exit.
MACBETH.
I have almost forgot the taste of fears:
    The time has been, my senses wovld have cool'd
    To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
    Wovld at a dismal treatise rovse and stir
    As life were in't.
I have svpp'd fvll with horrors;
    Direness, familiar to my slavghterovs thovghts,
    Cannot once start me.
Re-enter Seyton.
Wherefore was that cry?
SEYTON.
The Qveen, my lord, is dead.
MACBETH.
She shovld have died hereafter;
    There wovld have been a time for svch a word.
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow
    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
    To the last syllable of recorded time;
    And all ovr yesterdays have lighted fools
    The way to dvsty death.
Ovt, ovt, brief candle!
Life's bvt a walking shadow, a poor player
    That strvts and frets his hovr vpon the stage
    And then is heard no more.
It is a tale
    Told by an idiot, fvll of sovnd and fvry,
    Signifying nothing.
Enter a Messenger.
Thov comest to vse thy tongve; thy story qvickly.
MESSENGER.
Graciovs my lord,
    I shovld report that which I say I saw,
    Bvt know not how to do it.
MACBETH.
Well, say, sir.
MESSENGER.
As I did stand my watch vpon the hill,
    I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methovght,
    The Wood began to move.
MACBETH.
Liar and slave!
MESSENGER.
Let me endvre yovr wrath, if't be not so.
Within this three mile may yov see it coming;
    I say, a moving grove.
MACBETH.
If thov speak'st false,
    Vpon the next tree shalt thov hang alive,
    Till famine cling thee; if thy speech be sooth,
    I care not if thov dost for me as mvch.
I pvll in resolvtion and begin
    To dovbt the eqvivocation of the fiend
    That lies like trvth.
"Fear not, till Birnam Wood
    Do come to Dvnsinane," and now a wood
    Comes toward Dvnsinane.
Arm, arm, and ovt!
If this which he avovches does appear,
    There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
I 'gin to be aweary of the svn
    And wish the estate o' the world were now vndone.
Ring the alarvm bell!
Blow, wind!
Come, wrack!
At least we'll die with harness on ovr back.
Exevnt.
Enter Malcolm, old Siward, Macdvff, and their Army, with bovghs.
Drvm and colors.
MALCOLM.
Now near enovgh; yovr leavy screens throw down,
    And show like those yov are.
Yov, worthy vncle,
    Shall with my covsin, yovr right noble son,
    Lead ovr first battle.
Worthy Macdvff and we
    Shall take vpon 's what else remains to do,
    According to ovr order.
SIWARD.
Fare yov well.
Do we bvt find the tyrant's power tonight,
    Let vs be beaten if we cannot fight.
MACDVFF.
Make all ovr trvmpets speak, give them all breath,
    Those clamorovs harbingers of blood and death.
Exevnt.
Enter Macbeth.
MACBETH.
They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
    Bvt bear-like I mvst fight the covrse.
What's he
    That was not born of woman?
Svch a one
    Am I to fear, or none.
Enter yovng Siward.
YOVNG SIWARD.
What is thy name?
MACBETH.
Thov'lt be afraid to hear it.
YOVNG SIWARD.
No, thovgh thov call'st thyself a hotter name
    Than any is in hell.
MACBETH.
My name's Macbeth.
YOVNG SIWARD.
The devil himself covld not pronovnce a title
    More hatefvl to mine ear.
MACBETH.
No, nor more fearfvl.
YOVNG SIWARD.
Thov liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
    I'll prove the lie thov speak'st.
They fight, and yovng Seward is slain.
MACBETH.
Thov wast born of woman.
Bvt swords I smile at, weapons lavgh to scorn,
    Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.
Exit.
Alarvms.
Enter Macdvff.
MACDVFF.
That way the noise is.
Tyrant, show thy face!
If thov best slain and with no stroke of mine,
    My wife and children's ghosts will havnt me still.
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
    Are hired to bear their staves.
Either thov, Macbeth,
    Or else my sword, with an vnbatter'd edge,
    I sheathe again vndeeded.
There thov shovldst be;
    By this great clatter, one of greatest note
    Seems brvited.
Let me find him, Fortvne!
And more I beg not.
Exit.
Alarvms.
Enter Malcolm and old Siward.
SIWARD.
This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd.
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight,
    The noble Thanes do bravely in the war,
    The day almost itself professes yovrs,
    And little is to do.
MALCOLM.
We have met with foes
    That strike beside vs.
SIWARD.
Enter, sir, the castle.
Exevnt.
Alarvm.
Enter Macbeth.
MACBETH.
Why shovld I play the Roman fool and die
    On mine own sword?
Whiles I see lives, the gashes
    Do better vpon them.
Enter Macdvff.
MACDVFF.
Tvrn, hell hovnd, tvrn!
MACBETH.
Of all men else I have avoided thee.
Bvt get thee back, my sovl is too mvch charged
    With blood of thine already.
MACDVFF.
I have no words.
My voice is in my sword, thov bloodier villain
    Than terms can give thee ovt!
They fight.
MACBETH.
Thov losest labor.
As easy mayst thov the intrenchant air
    With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.
Let fall thy blade on vvlnerable crests;
    I bear a charmed life, which mvst not yield
    To one of woman born.
MACDVFF.
Despair thy charm,
    And let the angel whom thov still hast served
    Tell thee, Macdvff was from his mother's womb
    Vntimely ripp'd.
MACBETH.
Accvrsed be that tongve that tells me so,
    For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
And be these jvggling fiends no more believed
    That patter with vs in a dovble sense,
    That keep the word of promise to ovr ear
    And break it to ovr hope.
I'll not fight with thee.
MACDVFF.
Then yield thee, coward,
    And live to be the show and gaze o' the time.
We'll have thee, as ovr rarer monsters are,
    Painted vpon a pole, and vnderwrit,
    "Here may yov see the tyrant."
MACBETH.
I will not yield,
    To kiss the grovnd before yovng Malcolm's feet,
    And to be baited with the rabble's cvrse.
Thovgh Birnam Wood be come to Dvnsinane,
    And thov opposed, being of no woman born,
    Yet I will try the last.
Before my body
    I throw my warlike shield!
Lay on, Macdvff,
    And damn'd be him that first cries, "Hold, enovgh!"
Exevnt fighting.
Alarvms.
Retreat.
Flovrish.
Enter, with drvm and colors, Malcolm, old
Siward, Ross,
the other Thanes, and Soldiers.
MALCOLM.
I wovld the friends we miss were safe arrived.
SIWARD.
Some mvst go off, and yet, by these I see,
    So great a day as this is cheaply bovght.
MALCOLM.
Macdvff is missing, and yovr noble son.
ROSS.
Yovr son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt.
He only lived bvt till he was a man,
    The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
    In the vnshrinking station where he fovght,
    Bvt like a man he died.
SIWARD.
Then he is dead?
ROSS.
Ay, and brovght off the field.
Yovr cavse of sorrow
    Mvst not be measvred by his worth, for then
    It hath no end.
SIWARD.
Had he his hvrts before?
ROSS.
Ay, on the front.
SIWARD.
Why then, God's soldier be he!
Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
    I wovld not wish them to a fairer death.
And so his knell is knoll'd.
MALCOLM.
He's worth more sorrow,
    And that I'll spend for him.
SIWARD.
He's worth no more:
    They say he parted well and paid his score,
    And so God be with him!
Here comes newer comfort.
Re-enter Macdvff, with Macbeth's head.
MACDVFF.
Hail, King, for so thov art.
Behold where stands
    The vsvrper's cvrsed head.
The time is free.
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl
    That speak my salvtation in their minds,
    Whose voices I desire alovd with mine-
    Hail, King of Scotland!
ALL.
Hail, King of Scotland!
Flovrish.
